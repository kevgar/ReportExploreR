Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;) is a leading globalfinancial services firm with assets of $801&nbsp;billion and operations in more than50 countries. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial servicesfor consumers and businesses, financial transaction processing, investmentmanagement, private banking and private equity. JPMorgan Chase serves more than30&nbsp;million consumers nationwide and many of the world's most prominentcorporate, institutional and government clients. The Firm's wholesalebusinesses are known globally as &#147;JPMorgan,&#148; and its national consumer andmiddle market businesses are known as &#147;Chase.&#148; The wholesale businessescomprise four segments: the Investment Bank (&#147;IB&#148;), Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;TSS&#148;), Investment Management & Private Banking (&#147;IMPB&#148;) and JPMorganPartners (&#147;JPMP&#148;). IB provides a full range of investment banking andcommercial banking products and services, including advising on corporatestrategy and structure, capital raising, risk management, and market-making incash securities and derivative instruments in all major capital markets. Thethree businesses within TSS provide debt servicing, securities custody andrelated functions, and treasury and cash management services to corporations,financial institutions and governments. The IMPB business provides investmentmanagement services to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals andretail customers and also provides personalized advice and solutions to wealthyindividuals and families. JPMP, the Firm's private equity business, providesequity and mezzanine capital financing to private companies. The Firm'snational consumer and middle market businesses, which provide lending andfull-service banking to consumers and small and middle market businesses,comprise Chase Financial Services (&#147;CFS&#148;).OVERVIEW&nbsp;The momentum in global economic growth seen in 2003 carried into thefirst quarter of 2004, while business optimism continued to build, supported byattractive financial conditions, ongoing strong productivity and unprecedentedrecovery in corporate profits. Nevertheless, financial markets were volatile inthe first quarter, reflecting uncertainty about the U.S. employment outlook andthe actions the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;FederalReserve Board&#148;) might take on interest rates. Investors entered 2004 braced forrising interest rates, but with hiring slack, the economy far below potentialand inflation benign, a market consensus developed in the quarter that theFederal Reserve Board's policy would remain on hold for most of the year.These factors created a favorable capital markets environment for JPMorganChase, which contributed to earnings growth in the Firm's IB and IMPB segmentsto their highest levels in over three years, and provided opportunities forJPMP to realize gains. The strength in capital markets-related businesses morethan offset an earnings decline at CFS, which reflected the slowdown in themortgage refinancing market. As a result of improved credit quality in thecommercial portfolio and ongoing portfolio management activities utilizingcredit derivatives and loan sales, the Firm improved its credit risk profile.Net income for JPMorgan Chase of $1.9&nbsp;billion, or $0.92 per share, was thehighest quarterly result since the December&nbsp;2000 merger of The Chase ManhattanCorporation and J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated.24 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Total revenue of $9.0&nbsp;billion grew by 7% over the first quarter of 2003 and 11%over the fourth quarter. IB trading revenues benefited from favorable fixedincome market and currency conditions: corporate credit spreads remainednarrow, bond yields declined and the dollar continued to weaken against mostmajor currencies. Equity market values rose and equity issuance increased,adding to the strength in trading and contributing to the increase in privateequity gains at JPMP and in fees and commissions at IB, IMPB and TSS.Countering these favorable market conditions was a decline in GlobalTreasury's revenues (securities gains and net interest income)and in mortgageorigination volumes across the industry. At Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;), totalmortgage originations declined by 39% compared with the first quarter of 2003.Total expenses of $6.1&nbsp;billion increased by 9% year-over-year and 16% over thefourth quarter level. The fourth quarter of 2003 had an unusually low base ofexpenses due to an adjustment to incentive accruals, which reduced compensationcosts to reflect full-year incentives. Incentive accruals were higherrelative to prior periods because of higher revenues. The largest expense increases comparedwith the first quarter of 2003 were in CHF, within CFS, and TSS. As a result ofthe unprecedented refinancing boom during 2003, CHF increased staffthroughout the year to keep pace with volumes; expenses remainedcomparable to fourth quarter 2003 levels. Management expects expenses in both CHF and TSS tomoderate in future quarters to reflect the reduction in businessvolumes at CHF, andthe realization of synergies from acquisitions at TSS.The first quarter of 2004 Provision for credit losses of $15&nbsp;million declinedsignificantly from both comparable periods and was $429&nbsp;million lower than netcharge-offs in the quarter. Most of the reduction in the allowance for creditlosses was due to improvement in the quality of the commercialportfolio. During the first quarter of 2004, the Firm'scommercial nonperforming loans declined by 45% and criticized exposure levelsdeclined by 49% compared with the first quarter of 2003. At the same time, theconsumer portfolio had lower delinquencies and net charge-offs versus bothcomparable periods. As improvements in the quality of the commercialportfolio taper off and demand for commercial loans picks up,reductions in the allowance for creditlosses should moderate and credit costs could increase from the firstquarter 2004 level.The Firm's capital position at March&nbsp;31, 2004, was strong. Tier 1 capital of$44.7&nbsp;billion increased by 16% from the first quarter and 4% from the fourthquarter of 2003 as retained earnings increased. A rise in risk-weighted assets(as defined by banking regulators) resulted in a Tier 1 ratio that was flat compared with the year-ago level andlower than the year-end ratio. The regulatory weightings do notdistinguish between the risk ratings of credit exposure. At the same time, the Firm's internal measure ofrisk in the businesses, the amount of allocated capital, declined by 11% fromthe first quarter and 2% from the fourth quarter of 2003, as IB reduced creditrisk and JPMP reduced private equity investments.The table below shows JPMorgan Chase's segment results. These results reflectthe manner in which the Firm's financial information is currently evaluated bymanagement and are presented on an operating basis. For a discussion of theFirm's Segment results, including more information about operating results, seepages 32&#150;50 of this Form 10-Q. Prior-period segment results have been adjustedto reflect the alignment of management accounting policies or changes inorganizational structure among businesses.&nbsp;IB reported operating earnings of $1.1&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2004,its best performance in three years, up 24% and 29% from the first and fourthquarters of 2003, respectively. The low&#150;interest rate environment, volatilityin credit markets, and improvement in equity markets produced increased clientand portfolio management revenue in fixed income and equities. This coupledwith negative credit costs (i.e., a benefit to income) drove results.TSS operatingearnings of $119&nbsp;million for the quarter were up 6% compared withthe first quarter of 2003 and down 17% compared with the fourth quarter of2003; the fourth quarter result included a $41&nbsp;million pre-tax gain on the saleof a nonstrategic business. Acquisitions in Institutional Trust Services andTreasury Services drove revenue and expense growth in TSS. Higher global equityvalues resulted in increased fees in Investor Services, as pricing is tied toasset levels. Average deposits for TSS were up 33% from25 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)the first quarter of 2003, though spreads on deposits were low given the lowlevel of interest rates. At 15%, Return on average allocated capital for TSSwas negatively affected by goodwill from acquisitions.IMPB increased operating earnings and assets under supervision in the firstquarter of 2004 compared with the year-ago and prior quarters, aided byincreased equity market valuations in client portfolios and increased brokerageactivity. Net inflows in the quarter were at their highest levels in more thantwo years; strong inflows from the retail segment were coupled with netpositive institutional inflows for the first time in more than a year, areflection of improved investment performance.JPMP performance improved significantly, with a positive $526&nbsp;million increasein private equity gains from the first quarter of 2003. Net gains on directprivate equity investments, at $304&nbsp;million, benefited from higher sales ($302million in realized gains) and liquidity events such as initial publicofferings and much lower negative net valuation adjustments ($23&nbsp;million) ofcompanies in the portfolio.CFS operating earnings declined by $221&nbsp;million from the first quarter of 2003,92% of which was due to the decline in earnings at CHF. Strong productionresults in many of the businesses &#150; including increased purchase volume atChase Cardmember Services, deposit growth at Chase Regional Banking and ChaseMiddle Market, and higher home equity originations at CHF &#150; were more thanoffset by deposit spread compression, weak automobile leasing results andhigher severance and related costs.Business outlookToward the end of the first quarter, U.S. economic data began showing a gradualstrengthening in hiring and improvement in business conditions.Management expects higher interest ratessome time in the second half of 2004. Rising interest rates maynegatively affect the Firm's Home Finance and GlobalTreasury results compared with 2003. However, rising rates may be indicative of robust economic growth, which isbeneficial for many other businesses in the Firm. IB had a stronger pipeline forfees than in December or March of last year. In addition, client trading activity is independent of the direction of rate moves(although trading revenues in future quarters may be lower, as the first quarter is usuallyseasonally strong). IMPB, Investor Services and JPMP are expected to benefit from risingequity markets. Loan demand should increase as the economy continues to improveand corporations increase investments. The level of deposits maydecline as rates rise (although the interest rate spread couldwiden). Commercial net charge-off ratios may belower, but credit costs may rise as the reduction in the Allowance for creditlosses slows. Consumer loan losses may decline, but the interest ratespread on consumer loans may narrow.Business eventsAgreement to merge with Bank One CorporationOn January&nbsp;14, 2004, JPMorgan Chase and Bank One Corporation (&#147;Bank One&#148;)announced an agreement to merge. The merger agreement, which has been approvedby the boards of directors of both companies, provides for a stock-for-stockmerger in which 1.32 shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock will be exchanged,on a tax-free basis, for each share of Bank One common stock; cash will be paidfor fractional shares. JPMorgan Chase stockholders will keep their shares,which will remain outstanding and unchanged as shares of JPMorgan Chasefollowing the merger. The merger will be accounted for using the purchasemethod of accounting. The purchase price to complete the proposed merger isapproximately $58&nbsp;billion.The merged company, headquartered in New York, will be known as J.P. MorganChase & Co. and will have combined assets of $1.1 trillion, a strong capitalbase, 2,300 branches in 17 states and top-tier positions in retail banking andlending, credit cards, investment banking, asset management, private banking,treasury and securities services, middle markets and private equity. It isexpected that cost savings of approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion (pre-tax) will beachieved by 2007. Merger-related costs are expected to be approximately $3billion (pre-tax).Immediately following the announcement of the agreement to merge, integrationplanning was initiated. To date, detailed integration plans have beendeveloped, with more than 2,000 milestones centrally monitored; decisions havebeen made on most of the technology platforms that will be used by thecombined firm. For further information concerning the merger, see Note 2 onpage 7 of this Form 10-Q.26 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&nbsp;The following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase'sresults of operations on a reported basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment banking feesFor a discussion of Investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded inIB, see IB segment results on pages 34&#150;37 of thisForm 10-Q.Trading revenueFor a discussion of Trading revenue, which is primarily recorded in IB, see theIB segment results on pages 34&#150;37 of this Form 10-Q.Fees and commissionsThe table below provides the significant components of fees and commissions:&nbsp;The increases from both periods for Investment management and service fees andCustody and institutional trust service fees were primarily due to higherequity valuations of Assets under supervision (which includes assets undercustody); organic growth in the businesses including net inflows of assetsunder supervision; and to the acquisitions of the Bank One corporate trustbusiness in November&nbsp;2003 (which contributed $22&nbsp;million) and JPMorganRetirement Plan Services (&#147;RPS&#148;) in June&nbsp;2003 (which contributed $21million). Credit card fees rose by 6% from the first quarter of 2003,reflecting higher servicing fees on the $1.5&nbsp;billion growth in averagesecuritized credit card receivables; higher fees earned from the retainedcredit card portfolio as a result of the more robust customer purchase volume;and the favorable impact of changes in the pricing of several card products andservices. The decline in Credit card fees from the immediately precedingquarter reflected the seasonal decrease in purchase volume.Brokerage commissions increases from both periods were driven by the higheractivity levels in the global equities market. Lending-related service feeswere up from the first quarter of 2003 as a result of the growth in businessvolume, including a $3.3&nbsp;billion, or 85%, growth in the automobile loan servicing portfolio. Thedecline in Lending-related service fees from the prior quarter was principallyattributable to a lower volume of standby letters of credit negotiated in thequarter. The decrease in Deposit service fees compared with the first quarterof 2003 reflected higher balances maintained by institutional customers intheir deposit accounts, which reduced fees in lieu of compensating balances orbalance deficiency fees. The increase in Other fees was largely due to theacquisition of the Electronic Financial Services (&#147;EFS&#148;) business fromCitigroup in January&nbsp;2004, which contributed $55&nbsp;million.For additional information on Fees and commissions, see the segment discussionsof IMPB for investment management fees on pages 38&#150;40, TSS for custody andsecurities processing fees on pages 37&#150;38, and CFS for consumer-related fees onpages 43&#150;49 of this Form 10-Q.27 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Private equity gains (losses)For a discussion of the factors that fueled the improvement in the Firm'sprivate equity investment results, which are primarily recorded in JPMP, seethe JPMP segment discussion on pages 41&#150;42 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gainsSecurities gains decreased by 74% from the first quarter of 2003 due tosubstantial gains realized last year as rates declined. Most of thegains were realized by Global Treasury in connection with itsmanagement of the Firm's interest rate risk exposure. CHF uses AFS securities tomanage the economic risk of changes in the value of mortgage servicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;). Inthe 2004 first quarter, CHF realized a loss of $4&nbsp;million on its investment securities portfolio, compared with gains of $96&nbsp;millionand $13&nbsp;million in the 2003 first and fourth quarters, respectively.Mortgage fees and related incomeMortgage fees and related income decreased by 44% from the first quarter of2003 principally due to lower mortgage originations. Originationswere down 39% from the same quarter of last year. Theincrease of 74% from the prior linked quarter reflected better originationmargins and higher mortgage applications, as rates decreased from the fourthquarter. For a further discussion of total mortgage-related revenues, see thesegment discussion for CHF on pages 45&#150;46.Other revenueOther revenue rose 37% when compared with the 2003 first quarter, primarily theresult of higher gains on credit card and commercial mortgage loansecuritizations. Net gains related to credit card securitizations(consisting of new and revolving securitizations) was $39&nbsp;million, up$26&nbsp;million from the first quarter of the prior year; the gain oncommercial mortgage loan securitizations was $28&nbsp;million, up $10&nbsp;million fromthe 2003 first quarter. In addition, the 2003 first quarter included therecognition of certain nonoperating charges at American Century Companies, Inc.(&#147;American Century&#148;) that reduced equity income. The decline of 50% from the 2003 fourth quarter wasattributable to gains of $106&nbsp;million (versus $24&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2004) fromsales of securities acquired in loan satisfactions; a gain of $41&nbsp;million from the saleof a nonstrategic business in TSS; and a gain of $20&nbsp;million from the sale of a buildingin Geneva.Net interest incomeThe declines of 6% from the fourth quarter and 12% from the first quarter oflast year were the result of a lower volume of commercial loans and lowervolumes and lower spreads on available-for-sale investment securities. Thedecrease in commercial loans in IB was driven by softer demand and the Firm'sstrategic initiative to improve its credit risk profile; the reduction inavailable-for-sale investment securities reflected sales in 2003 inanticipation of higher interest rates. Also contributing to the declines wasthe compression in the overall spread on interest earning assets, includingtrading assets. Deposits at Chase Regional Banking, Chase Middle Market and TSSrealized lower NII from compressed spreads despite an increase in volume.On an aggregate basis, the Firm's total average interest-earning assets for thefirst quarter of 2004 were $601&nbsp;billion, relatively stable in comparison withthe $598&nbsp;billion recorded in the first quarter of last year. The net interestyield on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 1.90% in the2004 first quarter, 29 basis points lower than in the same period last year.NONINTEREST EXPENSEThe following table presents the components of Noninterest expense:&nbsp;Compensation expenseThe increase from the2003 first quarter was attributable to salary raises andhigher employee benefit costs including social security&#150;related taxes. The 31% rise from the 2003 fourthquarter was largely due to higher performance-related incentive accruals,principally in IB. The increase was partially offset by the transfer, beginningApril&nbsp;1, 2003, of approximately 2,800&nbsp;employees to IBM in connection with atechnology infrastructure outsourcing agreement; the related expenses of theseemployees, recognized in the prior year in Compensation expense, wereapproximately $70&nbsp;million. See Note&nbsp;5 on page&nbsp;9 for a discussion of theimpact on 2004 expenses of a $1.1&nbsp;billion contribution to the plan in April2004. In addition, severance-related costs of $103&nbsp;million were recognized inthe first quarter of 2004, compared with $76&nbsp;million in the first quarter of2003 and $102&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2003.28 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The Firm had 93,285 full-time equivalent employees at March&nbsp;31, 2004, comparedwith 93,878 at March&nbsp;31, 2003, and 93,453 at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The reductionin the number of employees in staff areas was mitigated by increases in growingbusinesses.Occupancy expenseThe declines in Occupancy from both periods were primarily driven by chargesfor unoccupied excess real estate of $78&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003and $71&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Partially offsetting the declinefrom the fourth quarter was the recognition of slightly higher property taxesand other building administration costs.Technology and communications expenseThe increase in Technology and communications expense from the first quarter oflast year was primarily due to the shift to this category of expenses as aresult of the aforementioned IBM outsourcing agreement; last year approximately$70&nbsp;million of these expenses were recognized in Compensation expense, and $45million of these expenses were recognized in Other expense. (The IBM agreementwas implemented in April&nbsp;2003.) The increase was also affected by higheramortization of capitalized software development costs, as well as highermarket data and IBM-related expenses, the latter items associated with thegrowing requirements of several business segments. The increase from the fourthquarter also reflected growth in business volume.Other expenseThe following table presents the components of other expense:&nbsp;For Professional services, the increase from last year's first quarterwas associated with higher counsel fees, related to growth in securitiesunderwriting transactions; whereas the decrease from the 2003 fourth quarterreflected lower litigation-related legal expenses. The increase in Outside services from both the first and fourthquarters of 2003 was primarily attributable to greater utilization ofthird-party vendors for processing activities in TSSand CFS. The expense increase at TSS was affected by the acquisitionof a business in the first quarter of 2004, which contributed $26&nbsp;million. The increase in Marketing from thefirst quarter of 2003 reflects higher direct marketingcampaigns in credit card and advertising by Regional Banking.Provision for credit lossesThe 2004 first quarterProvision for credit losses was $15&nbsp;million compared with $743&nbsp;million in the 2003 first quarterand was down $124&nbsp;million from the 2003 fourth quarter,reflecting improvement in the quality of the commercial loan portfolio. The decline from the firstquarter of 2003 was also due to a higher volume of credit card securitizations.For further information on the Provision for credit losses and the Firm'smanagement of credit risk, see the discussions of net charge-offs associatedwith the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and the Allowance for creditlosses, on pages 64&#150;66 of this Form 10-Q.Income tax expenseIncome tax expense was $973&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2004, compared with$722&nbsp;million in the first quarter and $845&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of2003. The effective tax rates were 33.5% for the first quarter of 2004, 34.0%for the first quarter of 2003 and 31.2% for the fourth quarter of 2003. Thedifferences in the tax rates were primarily reflective of the changes in theproportion of income subject to federal, state and local taxes.29 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;EXPLANATION AND RECONCILATION OF THE FIRM'S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES&nbsp;The Firm prepares its Consolidated financial statements using GAAP. TheConsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP appearon pages 3&#150;6 of this Form 10-Q. That presentation, which is referred to as&#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm'sresults that can be consistently tracked from year to year and enables acomparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' GAAP financialstatements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementreviews the line-of-business results on an &#147;operating basis,&#148; which is anon-GAAP financial measure. The definition of operating basis starts with thereported GAAP results. In the case of IB, operating basis includes inTrading revenue the NII related to trading activities. Trading activitiesgenerate revenues which are recorded for GAAP purposes in two line items on theincome statement: trading revenues, which include the mark-to-market gains orlosses on trading positions; and net interest income, which includes theinterest income or expense related to those positions. Combining both thetrading revenues and related net interest income enables management to evaluateIB's trading activities by considering all revenue related to these activitiesand facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. For a furtherdiscussion of Trading-related revenue, see IB on page 34&#150;37 of this Form 10-Q.In the case of Chase Cardmember Services, operating or managed basis excludesthe impact of credit card securitizations on revenue, the provision for creditlosses, net charge-offs and receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of&#147;managed receivables&#148; to evaluate the credit performance of the underlyingcredit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower is continuingto use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower's credit performancewill impact both the receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those not sold. Thus,in its disclosures regarding managed receivables, JPMorgan Chase treats thesold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in order todisclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entiremanaged credit card portfolio. The operating basis for all other lines ofbusiness is the same as reported basis. For a further discussion of credit cardsecuritizations, see Chase Cardmember Services on pages 46&#150;47 of this Form10-Q.30 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's reportedto operating results:&nbsp;Reconciliation from reported to operating basis&nbsp;31 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Management uses the SVA framework as its primary measure ofprofitability for the Firm and each of its business segments. To derive SVA,the Firm applies a cost of capital to each business segment. The capitalelements and resultant capital charges provide the businesses and investorswith a financial framework by which to evaluate the trade-off between the useof capital by each business unit versus its return to shareholders. JPMorganChase varies the amount of capital attributed to lines of business based on itsestimate of the economic risk capital required by the line of business as aresult of the credit, market, operational and business risk for each particularline of business and private equity risk for JPMorgan Partners. JPMorgan Chasebelieves this risk-adjusted approach to economic capital compensates fordiffering levels of risk across businesses, and therefore a constant 12% costof capital can be applied across businesses with differing levels of risk. Thecost of capital for JPMorgan Partners is 15%, because JPMorgan Chase believesthat the business risk for JPMP is so sufficiently differentiated that, evenafter risk-adjustment, a higher cost of capital is warranted. Capital chargesare an integral part of the SVA measurement for each business. Under the Firm'smodel, average common equity is either underallocated or overallocated to thebusiness segments, as compared with the Firm's total common stockholders'equity. The revenue and SVA impact of this over/under allocation is reportedunder Support Units and Corporate. See segment results on pages 27&#150;28 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report for a further discussion of SVA, and theGlossary of Terms on pages 74&#150;75 of this Form 10-Q for a definition of SVA.The following table provides a reconciliation of the Firm's operating earningsto SVA on a consolidated basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the segmentlevel. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provideinformation to investors in understanding the underlying operationalperformance and performance trends of the particular business segment andfacilitate a comparison with the performance of competitors. These includeTotal return revenue in IB, Tangible shareholder value added and Tangibleallocated capital in IMPB, and managed receivables and managed assets in ChaseCardmember Services. For a discussion of these line of business&#150;specificnon-GAAP financial measures, see the respective segment disclosures in segmentresults on pages 32&#150;50 of this Form 10-Q.Management measures its exposure to derivative receivables and commerciallending&#150;related commitments on an &#147;economic credit exposure&#148; basis. See Creditrisk management in this Form 10-Q on pages 54&#150;62.The following table provides a reconciliation of the Firm's average assets toaverage managed assets, a non-GAAP financial measure on a consolidated basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEGMENT RESULTS&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's lines of business are segmented based on the products andservices provided or the type of customer serviced and reflect the manner inwhich financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm's management.Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included indetermining that segment's results. Management accounting and other policiesexist to allocate those remaining expenses that are not directly incurred bythe segments.The segment results also reflect revenue- and expense-sharing agreementsbetween certain lines of business. Revenue and expenses attributed to sharedactivities are recognized in each line of business, and any double counting iseliminated at the segment level.32 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)These arrangements promote cross-selling and management of shared clientexpenses. They also ensure that the contributions of both businesses are fullyrecognized. Prior-period segment results have been adjusted to reflectalignment of management accounting policies or changes in organizationalstructure among businesses. Restatements of segment results may occur in thefuture. See Note 22 on pages 22&#150;23 of this Form 10-Q for further informationabout JPMorgan Chase's five business segments.Contribution of businesses for the first quarter of 2004As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, the overhead ratio for each business segment was: IB,59%; TSS, 83%; IMPB, 77%; and CFS, 59%. Overhead ratios provide comparabilityfor a particular segment with its respective competitors; they do notnecessarily provide comparability among the business segments themselves, aseach business segment has its own particular revenue and expense structure.33 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the IB, see pages 29-31 of JPMorgan Chase's2003 Annual Report. The following table sets forth selected IB financial data:&nbsp;&nbsp;34 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;IB operating earnings were $1.1&nbsp;billion in the first quarter, compared with$897&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and $862&nbsp;million in the fourthquarter of 2003. Earnings performance was driven by higher equity and fixedincome capital markets results including record trading revenues compared withthe first and fourth quarters of 2003. A significant improvement in commercialcredit quality, offset in part by the anticipated reduction in Global Treasury,also contributed to the increase over the first quarter of 2003. Return onaverage allocated capital was 28% for the quarter, compared with 17% and 20%for the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively.Operating revenues of $4.0&nbsp;billion were 1% lower than in the first quarter of2003 and up 31% from the fourth quarter of 2003. Investment banking fees were$682&nbsp;million, up 10% from the 2003 first quarter on higher equity and bondunderwriting fees, which were driven by increased market volumes, and partiallyoffset by lower loan syndication and advisory fees. These fees were down 18%from a strong 2003 fourth quarter, due primarily to lower equity underwriting,loan syndication and advisory fees. The decline in equity underwriting comparedwith the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected lower market volumes of rights issuesin Europe; the decline in loan syndication fees reflected lower volumes in newcommercial loan syndications. According to Thomson Financial, the Firmmaintained its No.&nbsp;1 ranking in global syndicated loans and No.&nbsp;2 ranking inglobal investment-grade bonds. For the first quarter of 2004 compared withfull-year 2003, the Investment Bank increased its ranking in global announcedM&A to No.&nbsp;3 from No.&nbsp;5, while its ranking in U.S. equity and equity-relateddeclined to No.&nbsp;7 from No.&nbsp;4. However, in U.S. initial public offerings, theFirm improved its ranking from No.&nbsp;14 for full-year 2003 to No.&nbsp;4.Composition of Capital Markets & Lending Revenue and Global Treasury:35 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)IB's capital markets and lending activities include fixed income andequities revenue and revenue from the Firm's credit portfolio, which includescorporate lending and credit risk management activities. The capital marketsand lending revenue includes both client (i.e., market-making) revenue andportfolio management revenue; the latter reflects net gains or losses,exclusive of client revenue, generated from managing residual risks in theportfolios, as well as gains or losses related to proprietary risk-takingactivities to capture market opportunities. IB evaluates its capital marketsactivities by considering all revenue related to these activities, includingTrading-related revenue, Fees and commissions, Securities gains,lending-related NII and other revenue.Capital markets and lending revenue (excluding Global Treasury) for the quarterwas $3.1&nbsp;billion, up 11% and 49% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003,respectively, due to substantial gains in equities as well as continued strongperformance in fixed income. Equity capital markets revenue of $673&nbsp;millionincreased substantially, up 56% and 97% over the first and fourth quarters of2003, respectively. Results were driven by higher trading revenue in bothequity derivatives and convertibles, reflecting higher client revenues inderivatives and increased portfolio management in an upward-moving marketenvironment. Higher brokerage fees and commissions within the equity cashbusiness were driven by higher market volumes. Fixed income revenue of $2.1billion increased by 5% from the first quarter and 51% from the fourth quarterof 2003, driven by increased trading revenues. The increases in trading revenuereflected strength in both client and portfolio management activities, drivenby the continued favorable interest rate environment. Client-related tradingrevenues were up in both the credit markets and interest rates businesses. Inparticular, foreign exchange posted record results, driven by increased volumesin foreign exchange options. Credit Portfolio revenue of $347&nbsp;million was down12% and 4% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively, drivenprimarily by lower loan volume and a continued decline in credit risk capital,resulting in lower NII for the period. The lower NII was partially offset by anincrease in Trading revenue due to spread widening on credit derivatives thatare used to manage risk in the loan portfolio. For additional information, seethe Credit risk management discussion on credit derivatives on pages 61&#150;62 ofthis Form 10-Q.Global Treasury's operating revenue was $212&nbsp;million, down 65% from the firstquarter of 2003 and up 48% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The decrease fromthe year-ago quarter reflected lower levels of NII, driven by lower couponreinvestment rates compared with the prior year. Securities gains decreased by68% from the first quarter of 2003 due to substantial realized gains last yearin the Firm's AFS investment securities portfolio. The increase in securitiesgains from the fourth quarter of 2003 was attributable to the higher volume ofsales in connection with Global Treasury's repositioning activities to manage,in part, the Asset/liability exposure of the Firm. Global Treasury is managedon a total-return revenue basis, which includes revenue plus the change inunrealized gains or losses on investment securities and risk managementactivities (included in Other comprehensive income) and internallytransfer-priced assets and liabilities. Global Treasury's total-return revenuewas negative $17&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2004, down from $535&nbsp;millionin the first quarter and $222&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Thedecline was driven by spread widening on mortgage-backed securities, which areused to help manage the Firm's overall interest rate exposure. GlobalTreasury's activities complement, and offer a strategic balance anddiversification benefit to, the Firm's trading and fee-based activities. For areconciliation of Global Treasury's total revenue to total-return revenue, seepage 34 of this Form 10-Q.Operating expense of $2.4&nbsp;billion was up 3% from the first quarter and 29% fromthe fourth quarter of 2003. The increase from the year-ago quarter wasattributable to higher compensation expenses, as a result of salary increases,higher employer taxes on a higher level of restricted stock vestings, andincreased travel and entertainment and legal costs. The increase over the priorquarter was largely due to higher compensation expenses, reflecting higherincentives on stronger business performance. Partially offsetting theseincreases were lower severance and related costs. The overhead ratio for thefirst quarter of 2004 was 59%, an increase of 200 basis points over the firstquarter of 2003, driven by the expense increases mentioned above.Credit costs were negative $188&nbsp;million for the quarter, compared with creditcosts of $245&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2003 and negative $241&nbsp;millionfor the fourth quarter of 2003. The reduction in credit costs from theprior-year quarter was primarily attributable to a reduction in the allowancefor credit losses as credit quality improved.

IB fees and client trading activity are largely independent of thedirection of interest rate moves, although trading revenue in subsequentquarters may be lower as the first quarter is usually seasonally strong.Commercial credit costs may rise, reflecting an increase in demand for loansand lower recoveries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within TSS, see pages 32&#150;33of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. The following table sets forth selectedfinancial data of TSS:&nbsp;&nbsp;37 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;TSS reported operating earnings of $119&nbsp;million, a 6% increase fromthe first quarter of 2003 and a 17% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003.Return on average allocated capital for the quarter was 15%, compared with 16%for the first quarter and 21% for the fourth quarter of 2003.Operating revenue was $1.1&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2004, an increase of19% and 3% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Fees andcommissions were up 25% and 10% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003,respectively, primarily driven by the acquisition of Citigroup's ElectronicFinancial Services business by Treasury Services, and by Institutional TrustServices' acquisitions of Bank One's corporate trust business and of FinancialComputer Software, L.P. In addition, Fees and commissions were higher due toincreased debt and equity market appreciation, coupled with increased organicgrowth (i.e., new business and volume growth of existing clients) at InvestorServices and Institutional Trust Services. Excluding the acquisitions, Fees andcommissions would have increased by 11% from the first quarter of 2003. Netinterest income increased by 8% and 3% from the first and fourth quarters of2003, respectively, due to higher U.S. and non-U.S. deposits, partially offsetby lower interest rate spreads on deposits, attributable to the low&#150;interestrate environment. All other revenue was 26% higher than in the first quarter of2003, primarily driven by higher foreign exchange revenue, which is the resultof increased transaction volume at Investor Services. All other revenue was 47%lower than in the fourth quarter of 2003, which included a $41&nbsp;million gain onthe sale of a nonstrategic business.Operating expense increased by 20% and 9% from the first and fourth quarters of2003, respectively. Compensation expense was up 10% and 7% from the first andfourth quarters of 2003, respectively, primarily driven by the aforementionedacquisitions, coupled with staff increases to support the new business andvolume growth, as well as higher incentives. Noncompensation expense was up 27%and 14% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003, reflecting the impact ofthe aforementioned acquisitions, higher professional services for strategicinvestments and technology projects, and increased costs to support newbusiness and higher volumes. Severance costs were up $3&nbsp;million from the firstquarter of 2003 and down $12&nbsp;million from the fourth quarter of 2003. Inaddition, fourth quarter 2003 severance and related costs included $4&nbsp;millionin charges to provide for losses on subletting unoccupied excess real estate.The first quarter 2004 overhead ratio was 83%, compared with 83% and 79% forthe first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. The increase from thefourth quarter was the result of the aforementioned gain on the sale of anonstrategic business recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003. Excluding thegain on the aforementioned sale, the fourth quarter 2003 overhead ratio wouldhave been 82%.Assets under custody of $8.0 trillion in the first quarter of 2004 were 28% and5% higher than in the first and fourth quarter of 2003, respectively, due toincreases in the debt and equity markets as well as new business and organicgrowth.Outlook: Management anticipates improving overhead ratios for TSS over thebalance of the year, as the expense synergies from the acquisitions by TreasuryServices and Institutional Trust Services materialize and as revenuesin Investor Services benefit from improving equity markets.INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile of IMPB, see pages 34-35 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report. The following table reflects selected financialdata of IMPB:&nbsp;&nbsp;38 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPB reported operating earnings of $115&nbsp;million in the first quarterof 2004, an increase of 326% from the first quarter and 15% from the fourthquarter of 2003. Return on average allocated capital for the first quarter of2004 was 8%, compared with 2% in the first quarter of 2003 and 7% in the fourthquarter of 2003. Return on tangible allocated capital was 36%, compared with 8%in the first quarter of 2003 and 30% in the fourth quarter of 2003. For furtherinformation on tangible allocated capital, see footnote (a)&nbsp;in the table above.Operating revenue was $824&nbsp;million, 29% higher than in the first quarter of2003 and flat to the fourth quarter of 2003. Global equity markets continued toimprove during the first quarter of 2004 (as exemplified by the S&P 500 index,which rose by 33% since the first quarter of 2003, and the MSCI World index,which rose by 41%). The increase from the prior-year quarter in Fees andcommissions primarily reflected global equity market appreciation; the impactof the acquisition of American Century Retirement Plan Services Inc., renamedJPMorgan Retirement Plan Services (&#147;RPS&#148;), in June&nbsp;2003; and increasedbrokerage activity. Higher earnings from the Firm's investment in AmericanCentury, in addition to the impact of accounting for the RPS joint ventureprior to the acquisition, drove the increase in All other revenue.Additionally, Other revenue for the first quarter of 2003 included a gain onthe sale of a Brazilian investment management business, offset by chargesincurred at American Century. The increase in Fees and commissions from theprior quarter reflected global equity market appreciation and AUS net inflows,offset by a decline in All other revenue associated with real estate gainsrecorded in the fourth quarter of 2003.Operating expense of $636&nbsp;million was 9% higher compared with the first quarterof 2003 and flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase fromthe year-ago quarter reflected the impact of the acquisition of RPS oncompensation and noncompensation expense, as well as higher compensationexpense reflecting strong earnings and increased marketing expense; these wereoffset by real estate and software write-offs taken in the first quarter of2003. The increase from the prior quarter reflected higher compensation andmarketing expense, offset by real estate and software write-offs taken in thefourth quarter of 2003. Credit costs were $10&nbsp;million, up from $6&nbsp;million inthe prior-year quarter and down from $36&nbsp;million in the prior quarter,reflecting provisions taken in the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarterof 2004.The overhead ratio for the quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2004, was 77%, a decreasefrom 91% for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, and flat compared with thefourth quarter of 2003. The decrease reflected improved operating leverage, asthe beneficial impact of higher market valuations on revenues outpaced growthin expenses.39 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Assets under supervision at March&nbsp;31, 2004, of $797&nbsp;billion were28% higher than at March&nbsp;31, 2003, and up 5% from December&nbsp;31, 2003. Assetsunder supervision increased from the first quarter of 2003, reflecting marketappreciation and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition of RPS and AUS netinflows. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected marketappreciation and AUS net inflows. Not reflected in Assets under management isthe Firm's 44% equity interest in American Century, whose Assets undermanagement were $90&nbsp;billion at quarter-end, compared with $71&nbsp;billion as of thefirst quarter of 2003 and $87&nbsp;billion as of the fourth quarter of 2003.Outlook: IMPB is expected to benefit from improving equity markets, whichshould result in new inflows while increasing the value of assets undersupervision.40 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMP, see pages 36&#150;37 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report. The following table sets forth selected financialdata of JPMorgan Partners:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMP reported operating earnings of $115&nbsp;million for the 2004 firstquarter, compared with an operating loss of $223&nbsp;million in the first quarterof 2003 and operating earnings of $23&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2003.Total private equity gains in the first quarter were $296&nbsp;million, comparedwith losses of $230&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and gains of $159million in the fourth quarter of 2003. During the first quarter, JPMP's directprivate equity investments recorded net gains of $304&nbsp;million, compared with anet loss of $136&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and a net gain of $198million in the fourth quarter of 2003. JPMP's direct private equity resultsincluded $302&nbsp;million in realized gains, mark-to-market gains of $25&nbsp;million ondirect public investments, and net write-downs and write-offs of $23&nbsp;milliontaken on direct private investment positions. Limited partner interests inthird-party funds resulted in net losses of $8&nbsp;million, compared with netlosses of $94&nbsp;million and $39&nbsp;million in the first and fourth quarters of 2003,respectively. First quarter results include a significant realized gainattributable to a private sale completed in the Consumer Retail & Servicessector. Overall, JPMP's performance benefited from active public and privatecapital markets during the period, which generated opportunities for liquidityevents and value recognition through sales, recapitalizations and initialpublic offerings.41 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)JPMP investment portfolioThe carrying value of the JPMP private equity portfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2004, was$6.8&nbsp;billion, a 6% decrease from December&nbsp;31, 2003, and a 16% decrease fromMarch&nbsp;31, 2003. JPMP has exited selectedinvestments that are not central to its portfolio strategy, with thegoal to reduce,over time, JPMP's private equity portfolio to approximately10%, as adjusted, of the Firm's common stockholders' equity. As of March&nbsp;31,2004, the portfolio has been reduced to approximately 14%.The private equity business is highly cyclical, and JPMP's results are subjectto significant volatility associated with the public equity markets,availability of high-yield financing for leveraged buyout transactions andinvestor appetite for private equity. With improving economicconditions, JPMP may have increased opportunities to exitprofitably direct investments as well as make newinvestments that are anticipated to generate high returns.JPMP invested $162&nbsp;million in direct private equity for the Firm's accountduring the first quarter of 2004, primarily in buyouts in the Consumer Retail &Services sector.The following table presents the carrying value and cost of the JPMP investmentportfolio for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlook: JPMP's performance is expected to improve as a result ofimproving equity markets andhigher merger activity.42 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of CFS and a discussion of the profiles for each of itsbusinesses, see pages 38&#150;43 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. Forinformation regarding loans and residual interests sold and securitized, seeNote 11 on pages 12&#150;14 of this Form 10-Q. The following table reflectsselected financial data of CFS:&nbsp;CFS reported first quarter 2004 operating earnings of $427&nbsp;million, a decreaseof 34% and 24% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Returnon average allocated capital for the first quarter was 18%, compared with 31%for the first quarter and 25% for the fourth quarter of 2003. Average allocatedcapital increased by 12% from the first quarter of 2003 and 6% from the fourthquarter of 2003, primarily due to an increase in market risk capital that isassociated with the MSR risk management activities of Chase Home Finance.Operating revenue was $3.4&nbsp;billion, a decrease of 8% and 5% from the first andfourth quarters of 2003, respectively. The national consumer credit businesses,which includes Chase Home Finance, Chase Cardmember Services and Chase AutoFinance, contributed 74% of first quarter 2004 operating revenue. The declinesin revenue were primarily driven by the anticipated slowdown in the mortgagerefinance business, as well as the continued negative impact of thelow&#150;interest rate environment on the deposit businesses. Net interest income of$2.2&nbsp;billion was down 2% and 8% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003,respectively, primarily due to lower interest on a lower level of AFSsecurities used to manage the interest rate risk associated with MSRs and lowerspreads as aresult of low interest rates. Fees and commissions increased by 6% from thefirst quarter of 2003, driven by higher credit card interchange fees due tohigher consumer purchases, and decreased by 8% from the fourth quarter of 2003due to seasonally lower43 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)credit card revenue. Securities gains declined from thefirst and fourth quarters of 2003, primarily due to fewer securities salesassociated with MSR risk management activities. Mortgage fees and relatedincome of $241&nbsp;million decreased from $432&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003and increased from $137&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2003. First quarter2004 mortgage originations were lower when compared with both the first andfourth quarters of 2003, due to the decline in the mortgage refinance market.First quarter 2004 MSR hedging revenue improved over the fourth quarter of2003.Operating expense of $2.0&nbsp;billion was up 11% and 7% compared with the first andfourth quarters of 2003, respectively. Compensation expense increased from boththe first and fourth quarters of 2003. The increase from the year-ago quarterwas primarily due to higher home equity production, as well as increases in thesales force for home equity and other higher-margin distribution channels. Theincrease in compensation expense from the fourth quarter was primarily due tohigher salaries, benefits and incentives. Noncompensation expense increasedfrom the prior periods primarily due to higher marketing costs, professionalservices and volume-related expenses. Severance and related costs increasedfrom the prior periods due to restructuring in various lines of businesses,particularly in Chase Regional Banking; costs incurred to move certain creditcard facilities to a lower-cost location; and, to a lesser extent, severancerelated to the anticipated merger with Bank One. CFS's overhead ratio was 59%,compared with 49% for the first quarter of 2003 and 52% for the fourth quarterof 2003, reflecting a decline in revenue and the higher level of expenses.Savings generated by Six Sigma and other productivity efforts continued topartially offset the growth in expenses.Credit costs of $748&nbsp;million were down 15% from the first quarter and 13% fromthe fourth quarter of 2003. The declines reflected lower net charge-offs of 5%and 3% compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively, and areduction in the allowance for loan losses, reflecting improved credit quality.Delinquency rates in the consumer loan portfolios decreased compared with thefirst and fourth quarters of 2003.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within CFS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Outlook:CHF revenues and operating earnings are expectedto decline for the remainder of the year as higher interest rates are likely to depress mortgage originations; however, management expectsexpenses at CHF to moderate in future quarters to reflect the reducedoriginationvolume. CFS' credit quality in consumer lending is expected to remain stable for the next severalquarters.Chase Home FinanceThe following table sets forth key revenue components of Chase Home Finance'sbusiness:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a record performance in 2003, Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;) reportedoperating earnings of $221&nbsp;million, a decrease of 48% and 7% from the first andfourth quarters of 2003, respectively. For the first quarter of 2004, totalrevenue of $813&nbsp;million decreased by 29% and 6% from the first and fourthquarters of 2003, respectively. During the first quarter, CHF operating revenuedeclined by 23% and 14% from the first and fourth quarters of 2003,respectively, as higher interest rates and a smaller refinance market loweredmortgage originations and margins. As described below, MSR hedging revenuedeclined relative to the first quarter of 2003 but increased by 92% relative tothe fourth quarter of 2003.CHF manages and measures its results from two key perspectives: its operatingbusinesses (Production, Servicing and Portfolio Lending) and revenue generatedthrough managing the interest rate risk associated with MSRs. The followingtable reconciles management's perspective on CHF's results to the reported GAAPline items shown on the Consolidated statement of income and in the relatedNotes to consolidated financial statements:&nbsp;&nbsp;On an operating basis, Net interest income of $539&nbsp;million declined from thefourth quarter of 2003, as CHF's average loans declined. Offsetting the declineand driving the increase in Net interest income over the first quarter of 2003was an increase in home equity balances, driven by origination growth of 60%over the first quarter of 2003. Home equity originations were down 8% comparedwith the fourth quarter of 2003, although applications were up 36%. Mortgagefees and related income were down compared with the first and fourth quartersof 2003, driven by lower origination volume of $38&nbsp;billion versus $62&nbsp;billionand $51&nbsp;billion, respectively, in the first and fourth quarters of 2003. Thedeclines reflect the smaller refinance market and price competition. Increasesin servicing revenues of 7% and 14% over the first and fourth quarters of 2003,respectively, partially offset the decline in production revenue. Servicingbalances as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, were $475&nbsp;billion, an increase of 10% from March31, 2003, and 1% from December&nbsp;31, 2003, the result of lower prepayments.In its risk management activities, CHF uses a combination of derivatives andAFS securities to manage changes in the market value of MSRs. The intent is tooffset any changes in the market value of MSRs with changes in the market valueof the related risk management instrument. During the first quarter of 2004,negative MSR valuation adjustments of $685&nbsp;million were partially offset by$678&nbsp;million of aggregate derivative gains and net interest earned on AFSsecurities. Unrealized losses on AFS securities were$71&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004, and $144&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Thedecline in the Net interest income and Securities gains components of MSRrevenue from the first and fourth quarters of 2003 is primarily due to a lowerlevel of AFS securities used to45 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)manage the interest rate risk associated withMSRs. The improvement in the Mortgage fees and related income component of MSRrevenue from the first and fourth quarters of 2003 reflects the mix ofinstruments used to manage the interest rate risk associated with MSRs at anypoint in time and the impact of market conditions on those instruments ratherthan a particular trend. For a further discussion of the most significantassumptions used to value MSRs, please see &#147;MSRs and certain other retainedinterests&#148; in the Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm section and inNotes 13 and 16 on pages 100&#150;103 and 107&#150;109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.The following table reconciles the amounts shown as MSR valuation adjustmentsof CHF's business:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expense of $478&nbsp;million increased by 25% from the first quarter of2003 and decreased by 1% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase comparedwith the year-ago quarter was due to higher home equity production, as well asincreases in the sales force for home equity and other higher-margindistribution channels. In the first two months of the first quarter of 2004,application volumes dropped dramatically but then rebounded in March; expenses,however, remained stable throughout the quarter. Higher expenses coupledwith lower operating revenues increased CHF's overhead ratio to 59%, ascompared with 33% in the first quarter of 2003. Lower operatingrevenues drove the increase in CHF's overhead ratio as compared with 56% in the fourth quarter of 2003.Credit costs of negative $9&nbsp;million decreased from both the first and fourthquarters of 2003. The decline from the prior-year quarter was primarily aresult of weakness in the manufactured housing market in the beginning of 2003.The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003 was due to a lower overall levelof both actual and expected net charge-offs, which drove a reduction in theallowance for loan losses. Credit quality remained strong as the net charge-offrate for the first quarter of 2004 was 0.16%, down from 0.20% and 0.19% in thefirst and fourth quarters of 2003, respectively.Chase Cardmember ServicesOperating earnings at Chase Cardmember Services (&#147;CCS&#148;) of $162&nbsp;millionincreased by 11% from the first quarter of 2003 and decreased by 6% from thefourth quarter of 2003. The increase from the first quarter of last year wasdriven by higher revenue, partly offset by higher marketing andseverance-related costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of last year wasattributable to seasonally lower purchase volume and higher marketing andseverance-related costs, partly offset by lower credit costs.CCS's operating results exclude the impact of credit card securitizations onrevenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and receivables.Securitization does not change CCS's reported net income versus operatingearnings; however, it does affect the classification of items on theConsolidated statement of income. The financial information presented belowreconciles reported basis and managed basis to disclose the effect ofsecuritizations.&nbsp;46 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating revenue was $1.6&nbsp;billion, up 7% from the first quarter of 2003 anddown 4% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in revenue from last yearreflected growth in both net interest and noninterest revenue. Net interestrevenue increased by 5%, reflecting lower funding costs and growth in averagemanaged loans. Average managed loans increased by 1% from a year ago, duepartly to lower balance transfer volume and to higher payment rates, whichreflected high consumer liquidity. Consumer liquidity remained high because ofincreased use of home equity products as well as lower tax rates. As aconsequence, the volume of purchases increased during the quarter, and the rateof payments was high. Noninterest revenue increased by 10%, reflecting higherinterchange fees primarily due to 15% growth in purchase volume. The increasein purchase volume also reflects the continued strategic shift in the portfoliotowards higher-volume, rewards-based products, as well as organic growth. CCSadded more than one million new accounts in the first quarter, the sixthconsecutive quarter of account additions at this level. The decline in revenuefrom the fourth quarter of 2003 was due to seasonally higher fourth quarterconsumer purchases associated with the holiday season.Operating expense of $605&nbsp;million increased by 12% from the first quarter and8% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in expenses from both periodsprimarily reflected higher marketing expenses and higher severance and relatedcosts, including expenses related to moving certain operations to lower costlocations. The overhead ratio increased to 39% from 37% and 35% in the firstand fourth quarters of 2003, respectively. The increase in the overhead ratiofrom the first quarter of last year was primarily attributed to increasedmarketing costs to attract and retain customers. The increase from the fourthquarter of last year primarily reflects lower seasonal revenue as well asincreased marketing costs.Credit costs increased by 2% from the first quarter of 2003 and declined by 11%from the fourth quarter of 2003. Credit quality improved, with the managed netcharge-off rate declining to 5.80% in the first quarter of 2004 from 5.95% inthe first quarter of 2003. The decline in credit costs from the fourth quarterreflected a decrease in the allowance for loan losses. The managed netcharge-off rate increased from 5.76% in the fourth quarter of 2003, dueprimarily to seasonality associated with higher delinquencies in the secondhalf of last year. The 30&#043; day delinquency rate improved from first and fourthquarter levels.Chase Auto FinanceResults at Chase Auto Finance (&#147;CAF&#148;) consist of the Auto Finance and EducationFinance businesses. CAF's operating earnings of $30&nbsp;million decreased by 19%from the first quarter and 43% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The decrease inoperating earnings was driven primarily by a $40&nbsp;million write-off of prepaidpremiums for residual risk insurance, which resulted in a reduction of leasingrevenue recognized during the current quarter, and higher operating expenses,partially offset by lower credit costs. The write-off was a result of a reviewin which it was determined that there was an accelerated pace of lease paymentsand terminations. CAF's operating revenue declined by 16% from the firstquarter and 20% from the fourth quarter of 2003, due to the reduction inleasing revenue mentioned above and lower portfolio spreads, partiallymitigated by higher average loans outstanding. Despite an extremely competitivemarketing environment, CAF's auto origination volume increased by 24% comparedwith the fourth quarter of 2003, and market share remained stable to year-end2003 at 6.1%.Operating expense of $81&nbsp;million was up 19% from the first quarter and 5% fromthe fourth quarter of 2003. The increase from the year-ago quarter was drivenby higher compensation expense, due to volume growth and correspondingincreases in staff, and higher performance-based incentives. The increase fromthe fourth quarter of 2003 was driven primarily by continued portfolio growth,higher compensation expense and slightly higher technology costs. The overheadratio increased to 49% in the first quarter, up from 34% and 37% in the firstand fourth quarters of 2003, respectively, primarily due to the reduction inleasing revenue and higher expenses.Credit costs of $36&nbsp;million decreased by 47% from the first quarter and 12%from the fourth quarter of 2003, due to lower net charge-offs and a lowerallowance for loan losses as a result of improved credit quality. The netcharge-off rate was 0.36% in the first quarter of 2004, down from 0.48% in thefirst quarter and 0.39% in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 30&#043; day delinquencyrate decreased to 1.10% in the first quarter of 2004, from 1.27% in the firstquarter and 1.46% in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 30&#043; day delinquency ratewas the lowest since June&nbsp;30, 2002.Chase Regional BankingChase Regional Banking (&#147;CRB&#148;) reported an operating loss of $15&nbsp;million in thefirst quarter, down from operating earnings of $27&nbsp;million in the first quarterof 2003 and an operating loss of $5&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Thedecrease from the year-ago quarter primarily resulted from higher expense andcredit costs, partially offset by slightly higher revenue. The decrease fromthe fourth quarter of 2003 was primarily due to lower revenue and higher creditcosts, partially offset by lower expense.Operating revenue of $635&nbsp;million increased by 1% from the first quarter of2003 and decreased by 3% from the fourth quarter of 2003. Despite lowerspreads, growth in average deposits of 10% from the first quarter of 2003resulted in Net interest income being up slightly. The decline in revenue fromthe fourth quarter of 2003 was due to narrower spreads and lower noninterestrevenue47 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)related to seasonal declines in deposit service fees, and lower debit card andinvestment revenues. Average deposits increased by 4% from the fourth quarterof 2003.Operating expense was up 10% from the comparable 2003 period and down 2% fromthe fourth quarter of 2003. The increase from the prior-year quarter reflectedhigher severance and related costs primarily due to restructuring, and highercompensation costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003 was primarilyrelated to the timing of marketing and professional services expenses. Theoverhead ratio for the quarter was 100%, up from 91% and 99% in the first andfourth quarters of 2003, respectively. The increase from the first quarter of2003 was due to higher expenses, while the increase from the fourth quarter wasdue to lower revenue.Credit costs of $28&nbsp;million were up from $8&nbsp;million and $18&nbsp;million,respectively, in the first and fourth quarters of 2003. The increase from theprior-year quarter was the result of a higher allowance for loan losses. Theincrease from the fourth quarter of 2003 was due to a higher allowance for loanlosses, partially offset by lower net charge-offs.As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, CRB's deposit mix was 18% demand, 14% interest checking,47% savings, 11% money market and 10% time (CDs). At March&nbsp;31, 2003, thedeposit mix was 18% demand, 14% interest checking, 46% savings, 9% money marketand 13% time (CDs). As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, core deposits (total deposits lesstime deposits) grew by 13% from March&nbsp;31, 2003, and 4% from December&nbsp;31, 2003.Chase Middle MarketChase Middle Market (&#147;CMM&#148;) operating earnings of $80&nbsp;million were down 8% fromthe first quarter and 13% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The decrease fromboth periods was primarily attributable to lower revenues, partially offset byimproved credit quality.Operating revenue of $343&nbsp;million decreased by 5% from the first quarter and 4%from the fourth quarter of 2003. The decrease from the year-ago quarter wasprimarily due to lower Net interest income, driven by a 4% decrease in averageloans and narrower loan and deposit spreads, partially offset by an 11%increase in average deposits. The decrease from the fourth quarter was due tolower Net interest income, reflecting narrower loan and deposit spreads,partially offset by a 2% increase in average loans and a 9% increase in averagedeposits.Operating expenses of $219&nbsp;million in the quarter were up 1% from the firstquarter and 4% from the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase from the firstquarter of 2003 was driven by higher performance-based incentives, partiallyoffset by lower severance and related costs. The increase from the fourthquarter was driven by higher incentives and higher severance and related costs.The overhead ratio for the quarter was 64%, up from 60% and 59% in the firstand fourth quarters of 2003, respectively, due to the decline in revenue andincrease in expenses.Lower net charge-offs and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses comparedwith the first and fourth quarters of 2003 resulted in credit costs ofnegative $13&nbsp;million.48 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICESQUARTERLY BUSINESS-RELATED METRICS&nbsp;&nbsp;49 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE&nbsp;&nbsp;The Support Units and Corporate sector includes technology, legal, audit,finance, human resources, risk management, real estate management, procurement,executive management and marketing groups within Corporate. For a furtherdiscussion of the business profiles of these Support Units as well as adescription of Corporate, see page 44 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Support Units and Corporate reflects the application of the Firm's managementaccounting policies at the corporate level. These policies allocate the costsassociated with technology, operational and staff support services to thebusiness segments, with the intent to recover all expenditures associated withthese services. Other items are retained within Support Units and Corporatebased on policy decisions, such as the over/under allocation of averageallocated capital, the residual component of credit costs and taxes. Businesssegment revenues are reported on a tax-equivalent basis, with the offsetreflected in Support Units and Corporate; see Note 22 on pages 22&#150;23 of thisForm 10-Q.For the first quarter of 2004, Support Units and Corporate reported operatingearnings of $44&nbsp;million, compared with an operating loss of $61&nbsp;million in thefirst quarter of 2003 and operating earnings of $176&nbsp;million in the fourthquarter of 2003. Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004 were drivenprimarily by higher capital and lower credit costs.In allocating the allowance (and provision) for credit losses, each business isresponsible for its credit costs. Although the Support Units and Corporatesector has no traditional credit assets, the residual component of theallowance, which is available for losses in any business segment, is maintainedat the corporate level. For a further discussion of the residual component, seeSummary of changes in the Allowance for credit losses on pages 65&#150;66 of thisForm 10-Q.Average allocated capital was $8.6&nbsp;billion higher than in the first quarter of2003 and $2.3&nbsp;billion higher than in the fourth quarter, reflecting a reductionin credit risk capital allocated to the business segments and an increase incommon stockholders' equity.The Firm's operating expenses reflected a shift of $115&nbsp;million fromCompensation and Other expense to Technology and communications expense due tothe technology infrastructure outsourcing that took effect on April&nbsp;1, 2003.For additional disclosure, see Results of operations on page 28&#150;29 of this Form10-Q.&nbsp;RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational,business, fiduciary, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion ofthese risks and definitions of terms associated with managing these risks, seepages 45&#150;74 and the Glossary of terms in JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.50 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT&nbsp;CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2003, and should be read inconjunction with pages 46&#150;47 and Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.&nbsp;Economic risk capital:JPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy utilizing internal risk assessmentmethodologies. The Firm assigns economic capital based primarily on five riskfactors: credit risk, market risk, operational risk and business risk for eachbusiness, and private equity risk, principally for JPMP. The methodologiesquantify these risks and assign capital accordingly. These methodologies arediscussed in the risk management sections of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.Capital also is assessed against business units for certain nonrisk factors.Businesses are assessed capital equal to 100% of any goodwill and 50% forcertain other intangibles generated through acquisitions. Additionally, theFirm assesses an &#147;asset capital tax&#148; against managed assets and someoff&#150;balance sheet instruments. These assessments recognize that certain minimumregulatory capital ratios must be maintained by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase alsoestimates the portfolio effect on required economic capital, based oncorrelations of risk across risk categories. This estimated diversificationbenefit leads to a reduction in required economic capital for the Firm.The Firm's capital in excess of that which is internally required as of March31, 2004, increased by $8.8&nbsp;billion over March&nbsp;31, 2003. The change wasprimarily due to an increase in average common stockholders' equity of $3.9billion, a $5.6&nbsp;billion reduction in credit risk capital and a $0.8&nbsp;billionreduction in private equity capital, partially offset by a $1.4&nbsp;billionincrease in market risk capital. The decrease in credit risk capital from theprior year was primarily due to a reduction in commercial exposures andimprovement in the credit quality of the commercial portfolio. Private equityrisk decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in JPMP's private equityportfolio. Market risk capital increased, due to growth in the MSR portfolio inCHF as well as higher average trading VAR in IB.Regulatory capitalJPMorgan Chase's risk-based capital ratios at March&nbsp;31, 2004, were well inexcess of minimum regulatory guidelines. At March&nbsp;31, 2004, Tier 1 and Totalcapital ratios were 8.4% and 11.4%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 5.9%. At March&nbsp;31, 2004, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (thesum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) was $60.9&nbsp;billion, an increase of $1.1billion from December&nbsp;31, 2003. This increase was principally driven by a $1.5billion increase in Tier 1 capital, reflecting $1.2&nbsp;billion in retainedearnings (net income less common and preferred dividends) generated during theperiod and net stock issuance of $0.5&nbsp;billion related to employee benefitplans, partially offset by a decrease in the allowance for credit lossescomponent of Tier 2 capital.51 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)During 2003, the Firm adopted FIN 46 and, as a result, deconsolidated thetrusts that issue trust preferred securities. If banking regulatorswere to exclude these securities from Tier&nbsp;1 capital, it couldsignificantly reduce the Tier&nbsp;1 capital ratio of the Firm. On July&nbsp;2,2003, the Federal Reserve Board issued a supervisory letter instructing banksand bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities inTier 1 capital. Based on the terms of this letter and in consultation with theFederal Reserve Board, the Firm continues to include its trust preferredsecurities in Tier 1 capital.Stock repurchaseThe Firm did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the firstquarter of 2004 or all of 2003. At the time the Firm and Bank One announcedtheir proposed merger, managements at the two firms announced their intentionto repurchase shares in an aggregate amount of approximately $3.5&nbsp;billionannually in 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in addition to shares repurchased to providecommon stock required for both firms' respective dividend-reinvestment andemployee equity-based plans). The aforementioned repurchase program was madebased on both firms' respective managements' determinations that, based uponmarket conditions, current business plans and expectations for the combinedcompany, stock repurchases present an attractive use of excesscapital. The actual amount of sharesrepurchased will be subject to the discretion of the combined company's Boardof Directors considering factors whichinclude: market conditions; legal considerations; the combined company's capital position (takinginto account purchase accounting adjustments); internal capital generation; andalternative potential investment opportunities over that time frame.DividendsIn the first quarter of 2004, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cash dividendon its common stock of $0.34 per share, payable April&nbsp;30, 2004, to stockholdersof record at the close of business April&nbsp;6, 2004.LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2003, and should be read inconjunction with pages 47&#150;48 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. Inmanaging liquidity, management considers a variety of liquidity risk measuresas well as market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs andthe desired maturity profile of its liabilities.Consistent with its liquidity management policy, the Firm has raised funds atthe holding company sufficient to cover maturing obligations over the next 12months. Long-term funding needs for the parent holding company over the nextseveral quarters are expected to be consistent with prior periods. The Firmmanages its liquidity through a combination of short- and long-term sources offunds to support its balance sheet and its businesses. Under the Firm'sliquidity risk management framework, the Firm maintains sufficient levels oflong-term liquidity through a combination of long-term debt, preferred stock,common equity and core deposits to support the less liquid assets on itsbalance sheet. The Firm's primary source of short-term funds, excludingunsecured borrowings, includes more than $40&nbsp;billion of securities availablefor repurchase agreements and approximately $30&nbsp;billion of credit card,automobile and mortgage loans available for securitization.Credit ratingsThe credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorganChase Bank as of April&nbsp;30, 2004, were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the announcement of the proposed merger with Bank One, Moody's and Fitchplaced the ratings of the Firm under review for possible upgrade, while S&Paffirmed the Firm's ratings.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by creditratings. A reduction in these ratings could adversely impact the Firm's accessto liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateralrequirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing tolend. If the Firm's ratings were downgraded by one notch, the Firm estimatesthat the incremental cost of funds to be in the range of 5 basis points to 30basis points, reflecting a range of terms from three to five years, and thepotential loss of funding to be negligible. Additionally, the Firm estimatesthe additional funding requirements for SPE and52 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)other third-party commitments to be relatively modest. In the currentenvironment, the Firm believes the likelihood of a downgrade is remote. Foradditional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on fundingrequirements for SPEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements,see Off-balance Sheet Arrangements below and page 61, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Balance sheetThe Firm's total assets increased by $30.2&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2003, to$801.1&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, largely due to an increase in deposits placedwith banks and investment securities. Debt and equity trading assets were alsohigher due to growth in IB business activities. Commercial loans declined by$3.9&nbsp;billion, mostly as a result of the deconsolidation of a Firm-sponsoredasset-backed commercial paper conduit which had been previously consolidated onthe Firm's balance sheet under the guidance of FIN 46. Consumer loans increasedby $2.0&nbsp;billion, led by increases in home equity loans. Credit card loansdeclined modestly due to seasonal factors and lower volumes; loan volumes inthe quarter were affected by increased securitization activity, partiallyoffset by strong purchase volumes. Automobile loans increased slightly, helpedby higher origination volumes over the fourth quarter of last year. EffectiveJanuary&nbsp;1, 2004, the Firm elected to net cash paid and received undercredit-support annexes to legally enforceable master netting agreements;thereby reducing Derivative receivables by $28.7&nbsp;billion and Derivativepayables by $19.7&nbsp;billion. The Firm'sliabilities also increased in an amount consistent with the above asset growth,through a combination of continued growth in deposits, which contributed to thegrowth in investment securities, and higher securities sold under repurchaseagreements.IssuanceDuring the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, JPMorgan Chase issuedapproximately $4.9&nbsp;billion of long-term debt; during the same period, $2.8billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed. In addition, the Firmsecuritized approximately $2.7&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans, $1.5billion of credit card loans and $1.6&nbsp;billion of automobile loans, resulting inpre-tax gains (losses)&nbsp;on securitizations of $48&nbsp;million, $10&nbsp;million and $(3)million, respectively. For a further discussion of loan securitizations, seeNote 11 of this Form 10-Q and Note 13 on pages 100&#150;103 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003Annual Report.Off&#150;balance Sheet ArrangementsSpecial-purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;), special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;) orvariable-interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;), are an important part of the financialmarkets, providing market liquidity by facilitating investors' access tospecific portfolios of assets and risks. JPMorgan Chase is involved with SPEsin three broad categories of transactions: loan securitizations (through&#147;qualifying&#148; SPEs), multi-seller conduits, and client intermediation. Capitalis held, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and relatedexposures such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments. Fora further discussion of SPEs and the Firm's accounting for SPEs,see Notes 11and 12 of this Form 10-Q and Note 1 on pages 86&#150;87, Note 13 on pages 100&#150;103and Note 14 on pages 103&#150;106 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required toprovide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgradedbelow specific levels, primarily P-1, A-1 and F1 for Moody's, Standard & Poor'sand Fitch, respectively. The amount of these liquidity commitments was $32.3billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004. If JPMorgan Chase Bank were required to providefunding under these commitments, the Firm could be replaced as liquidityprovider. Additionally, with respect to the multi-seller conduits andstructured commercial loan vehicles for which JPMorgan Chase Bank has extendedliquidity commitments, the Bank could facilitate the sale or refinancing of theassets in the SPE in order to provide liquidity.Of its $32.3&nbsp;billion in liquidity commitments to SPEs, $31.1&nbsp;billion isincluded in the Firm's total Other unfunded commitments to extend credit,included in the table on the following page. As a result of the consolidation of multi-sellerconduits in accordance with FIN 46, $1.2&nbsp;billion of these commitments areexcluded from the table, as the underlying assets of the SPE have been includedon the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet.The following table summarizes certain revenue information related to VIEs withwhich the Firm has significant involvement, and qualifying SPEs:&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue reported in the table above primarily represents servicing andcustodial fee income. The Firm also has exposure to certain VIE vehiclesarising from derivative transactions with VIEs; these transactions are recordedat fair value on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalue (i.e., mark-to-market gains and losses) recorded in Trading revenue. SuchMTM gains and losses are not included in the revenue amounts reported in thetable above.53 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase's off&#150;balance sheetlending-related financial instruments by remaining maturity at March&nbsp;31, 2004:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit portfolio as of March&nbsp;31,2004, focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2003, and should beread in conjunction with pages 51&#150;65, pages 74&#150;77 and Notes 11, 12, 29 and 30of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.The Firm assesses its consumer credit exposure on a managed basis, includingcredit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of credit costs on anoperating, or managed, basis to reported results, see pages 30&#150;32 of this Form10-Q.The Firm allocates credit risk capital to the lines of business based upon itsassessment of &#147;economic credit exposure,&#148; a non-GAAP financial measure that, inthe Firm's view, represents actual future credit exposure. The principaldifference between The Firm's credit exposure on a reported basis and itseconomic view of credit exposure relates to the way the Firm views its creditexposure to derivative receivables and lending-related commitments. For furtherinformation, refer to pages 60 and 62 of this Form 10-Q.54 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;The following table presents a summary of the Firm's credit portfolio for the dates indicated:Commercial and consumer credit portfolio&nbsp;&nbsp;55 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's total credit exposure (including $34&nbsp;billion of securitizedcredit cards) totaled $718&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, a decline from $731billion at year-end 2003. The decrease reflected a 7% reduction in commercialexposure, offset by a 4% increase in consumer exposure.&nbsp;COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;Total commercial exposure was $356&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, compared with$383&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The $27&nbsp;billion decline was mainly due to a$25&nbsp;billion decline in derivative receivables, because, effective January&nbsp;1,2004, the Firm elected to net cash paid and received under credit supportannexes to legally enforceable master netting agreements. Loans decreased by $4billion as a result of the deconsolidation of a Firm-sponsored asset-backedcommercial paper conduit which was previously consolidated on the Firm'sbalance sheet under the guidance of FIN 46; the conduit was deconsolidated dueto a restructuring. Lending-related commitments increased by $3&nbsp;billion; $4billion was attributable to the deconsolidation of an asset-backed commercialpaper conduit, offset by a $1&nbsp;billion decrease due to deal flow.Below are summaries of the maturity and ratings profiles of the commercialportfolio as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003. The ratings scale isbased on the Firm's internal risk ratings and is presented on an S&P-equivalentbasis.&nbsp;56 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, the commercial exposure ratings profile remainedrelatively stable compared with December&nbsp;31, 2003.Commercial Exposure &#150; selected industry concentrationThe Firm continues to focus on the management and diversification of itsindustry concentrations, with particular attention paid to industries withactual or potential credit concerns. The only significant change in reportedindustry exposure since December&nbsp;31, 2003, relates to the Firm's exposure toCommercial banks, which decreased by $19&nbsp;billion, or 40%, from December&nbsp;31,2003, to $28&nbsp;billion as of March&nbsp;31, 2004. The decline was primarily the resultof the Firm's election to net cash received under credit supportannexes to legally enforceable master netting agreements, which affectedderivative receivables. A significant portion of the Firm's derivativesportfolio is transacted with customers in the commercial banking industry.57 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Criticized ExposureExposures deemed criticized generally represent a ratings profile similar to arating of CCC&#043;/Caa1 and lower, as defined by Standard & Poors/Moody's.Continuing the trend experienced during 2003, the criticized component of theportfolio declined by $1.5&nbsp;billion, or 17%, during the first quarter of 2004.The decrease was due to debt repayments and facility upgrades as a result ofclient recapitalizations, additional security and collateral taken inrefinancings, client upgrades from improved financial performance and a lack ofmigration of new exposures into the portfolio. Also contributing to thedecrease were gross charge-offs of $0.2&nbsp;billion.Enron-related exposureThe Firm's exposure to Enron and Enron-related entities was reduced from $609million at December&nbsp;31, 2003, to $545&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004. The decreasewas primarily due to the reduction of debtor-in-possession financing. At March31, 2004, secured exposure of $207&nbsp;million is performing and reported on anamortized cost basis.Country ExposureThe selection of countries is based on the materiality of the Firm's exposureand its view of actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Exposureamounts are adjusted for credit enhancements (e.g., guarantees and letters ofcredit) provided by third parties located outside the country if theenhancements fully cover the country risk, as well as the commercial risk. Inaddition, the benefit of collateral, credit derivatives used to managecommercial exposure, and short debt or equity trading positions are taken intoaccount. Total exposure includes exposure to both government and private-sectorentities in a country.The exposure to Brazil was $2.4&nbsp;billion and $2.0&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively. The exposure to Mexico was $2.4&nbsp;billion and$1.5&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively. Theincrease in exposure to Brazil and Mexico over the prior year-end was due totrading positions, both cross-border and local.The Firm's exposures to other countries disclosed in JPMorgan Chase's 2003Annual Report have had immaterial changes in exposure since year-end 2003.Likewise, during the quarter, the credit conditions in these countries remainedstable or improved.58 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Derivative ContractsFor a further discussion of the derivative contracts utilized by JPMorgan Chasein connection with its trading and end-user activities, see Note 19 of thisForm 10-Q, and pages 58&#150;61 and Note 28 on pages 116&#150;117 of JPMorgan Chase's2003 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and the reportedderivative receivables (i.e., the MTM or fair value of the derivative contractsafter taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the dates indicated:Notional amounts and derivative receivables MTM&nbsp;&nbsp;The $36 trillion of notional principal of the Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at March&nbsp;31, 2004, significantly exceeds, in the Firm's view, thepossible credit losses that could arise from such transactions. For mostderivative transactions, the notional principal amount does not change hands;it is simply used as a reference to calculate payments. In terms of currentcredit risk exposure, the appropriate measure of risk is, in the Firm's view,the MTM value of the contract. The MTM exposure represents the cost to replacethe contracts at current market rates should the counterparty default. WhenJPMorgan Chase has more than one transaction outstanding with a counterparty,and a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists with thecounterparty, the MTM exposure, less collateral held, represents, in the Firm'sview, the appropriate measure of current credit risk with that counterparty asof the reporting date. At March&nbsp;31, 2004, the MTM value of derivativereceivables (after taking into account the effects of legally enforceablemaster netting agreements and the impact of net cash received under creditsupport annexes to such legally enforceable master netting agreements) was $59billion. Further, after taking into account $10&nbsp;billion of other highly liquidcollateral held by the Firm, the net current MTM credit exposure was $49billion. As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, based on the MTM value of its derivativereceivables and after taking into account the effects of legally enforceablemaster netting agreements and collateral held, the Firm did not have aconcentration to any single derivative receivable counterparty greater than 5%.While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net MTM value ofderivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability ofthat credit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm calculates, on aclient-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related creditloss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent and Average exposure. These measures allincorporate netting and collateral benefits where applicable. The last measure,Average exposure (&#147;AVG&#148;), is used as the basis for the Firm's Economic view ofits credit exposure, upon which it allocates credit capital to the variouslines of business. For more information, see page 53 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003Annual Report. The amount of these measures did not change significantly sinceDecember&nbsp;31, 2003.59 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table reconciles Derivative receivables on a MTM basis with theFirm's Economic credit exposure, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the datesindicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTM value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates a CreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;) to reflect the credit quality of counterparties.The CVA was $657&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004, a slight increase from $635&nbsp;millionat December&nbsp;31, 2003. The CVA is based on the Firm's AVG to a counterparty, andon the counterparty's credit spread in the credit derivatives market. Theprimary components of changes in CVA are credit spreads, new deal activity orunwinds, and changes in the underlying market environment. For a discussion ofthe impact of CVA on Trading revenue, see portfolio management activity on page61 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm's Consolidatedbalance sheet derivative receivables MTM, net of cash and other highly liquidcollateral, for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firm actively pursues the use of collateral agreements to mitigatecounterparty credit risk in derivatives. The percentage of the Firm'sderivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements decreased slightly to75% as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, from 78% at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Firm held $39billion of collateral as of March&nbsp;31, 2004 (including $29&nbsp;billion of net cashreceived under credit support annexes to legally enforceable master nettingagreements), compared with $36&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Firm posted$28&nbsp;billion of collateral as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, compared with $27&nbsp;billion atthe end of 2003.60 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Certain derivative and collateral agreements include provisions that requireboth the Firm and the counterparty, upon specified downgrades in theirrespective credit ratings, to post collateral for the benefit of the otherparty. The impact on required collateral of a single-notch ratings downgrade toJPMorgan Chase Bank, from its current rating of AA- to A&#043;, would have been anadditional $1.3&nbsp;billion of collateral as of March&nbsp;31, 2004. The impact of asix-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- to BBB-) wouldhave been $3.9&nbsp;billion of additional collateral as of March&nbsp;31, 2004. Certainderivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generallyupon JPMorgan Chase Bank being downgraded, at the then-existing MTM value ofthe derivative receivables.Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the Firm's notional amounts of credit derivativesprotection bought and sold as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase has limited counterparty exposure as a result of creditderivatives transactions. Of the $59&nbsp;billion of total derivative receivables atMarch&nbsp;31, 2004, approximately $3&nbsp;billion, or 5%, was associated with creditderivatives, before the benefit of highly liquid collateral. The use of creditderivatives to manage exposures does not reduce the reported level of assets onthe balance sheet or the level of reported off&#150;balance sheet commitments.Portfolio management activityIn managing its commercial credit exposure, the Firm purchases single-name andportfolio credit derivatives. As of March31, 2004, the notional outstanding amount of protection purchased viasingle-name and portfolio credit derivatives was $35&nbsp;billion and $2&nbsp;billion,respectively. The Firm also diversifies its exposures by providing (i.e.,selling) small amounts of credit protection, which increases exposure toindustries or clients where the Firm has little or no client-related exposure.This activity is not material to the Firm's overall credit exposure: at March31, 2004, no credit protection had been sold, and credit protection soldtotaled $67&nbsp;million in notional exposure at December&nbsp;31, 2003.The credit derivatives used by JPMorgan Chase for its portfolio managementactivities do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, and therefore,effectiveness testing under SFAS 133 is not performed. These derivatives aremarked to market in Trading revenue. The MTM value incorporates both the costof credit derivative premiums and changes in value due to movement in spreadsand credit events, whereas the loans and lending-related commitments being riskmanaged are accounted for on an accrual basis in Net interest income andassessed for impairment in the Provision for credit losses. This asymmetry inaccounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and thecredit derivatives utilized in portfolio management activities, causes earningsvolatility that is not representative of the true changes in value of theFirm's overall credit exposure. The MTM treatment of both the Firm's creditderivatives used for managing credit exposure (&#147;short&#148; credit positions) andthe CVA, which reflects the credit quality of derivatives counterparty exposure(&#147;long&#148; credit positions), provides some natural offset.Additionally, commercial credit exposure is actively managed through secondaryloan and commitment sales that are not associated with loan syndicationactivity or securitization activity as described in Note 11 of this Form 10-Q.During the first quarter of 2004, proceeds from the sale of $774&nbsp;million ofloans and $700&nbsp;million of commitments resulted in a net loss of $8&nbsp;million.During the same period in 2003, the sale of $607&nbsp;million of loans and $450million of commitments resulted in a net loss of $12&nbsp;million.61 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Portfolio management activity in the first quarter of 2004 resulted in $58million of gains included in Trading revenue. These gains included $26&nbsp;millionrelated to credit derivatives used to manage the Firm's credit exposure; ofthis amount, approximately $21&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivativesused to manage the risk of accrual lending activities, and the remaining wasassociated with credit derivatives used to manage the overall derivativesportfolio. The gains were driven by a widening of high-yield credit spreads.Additionally, there were $32&nbsp;million of gains related to the change in the MTMvalue of the CVA.Trading revenue from portfolio management in the first quarter of 2003 resultedin losses of $27&nbsp;million. The losses consisted of $110&nbsp;million related tocredit derivatives used to manage the Firm's credit exposure; of this amount,$71&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivatives used to manage the risk ofaccrual lending activities, and the remaining was associated with creditderivatives used to manage the risk of the overall derivatives portfolio. Thelosses were due to an overall global tightening of credit spreads. These losseswere offset by $83&nbsp;million in gains resulting from a decrease in the MTM valueof the CVA, the result of spread tightening.Dealer client activityAs of March&nbsp;31, 2004, the total notional amounts of protection purchased andsold by the dealer business were both $293&nbsp;billion. Although the notionalamounts were equal as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, at other times there may be mismatchesbetween these amounts. The mismatch would be the result of the Firm sellingprotection on large, diversified, predominantly investment-grade portfolios(including the most senior tranches) and then hedging these positions by buyingprotection on the more subordinated tranches of the same portfolios. Inaddition, the Firm may use securities to hedge certain derivative positions.Consequently, while there could be a mismatch in notional amounts of creditderivatives, in the Firm's view, the risk positions are largely matched.Lending-related commitmentsThe contractual amount of commercial lending-related commitments was $218billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, compared with $216&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Inthe Firm's view, the total contractual amount of these instruments is notrepresentative of the Firm's actual credit risk exposure or fundingrequirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has tocommercial lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis forallocating credit-risk capital to these instruments, the Firm has established a&#147;loan equivalent&#148; amount for each commitment; this represents the portion ofthe unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is likely, based onaverage portfolio historical experience, to become outstanding in the event ofa default by an obligor.The following table reconciles the reported contractual amounts of the Firm'slending-related commitments on a GAAP basis with the Firm's Economic creditexposure, a non-GAAP financial measure, as of the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;62 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio consists primarily of 1-4 familyresidential mortgages, credit cards and automobile financings. The consumerportfolio is predominantly U.S.-based. The Firm's managed consumer portfoliototaled $362&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, an increase of 4% from December&nbsp;31,2003. Consumer lending-related commitments increased by 7% to $189&nbsp;billion atMarch&nbsp;31, 2004. The following table presents a summary of consumer creditexposure on a managed basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-relatedcommitment categories within the consumer portfolio:Residential Mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily secured byfirst mortgages and were $75.9&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, a $2.2&nbsp;billionincrease from year-end 2003. At March&nbsp;31, 2004, the Firm had $2.6&nbsp;billion ofsub-prime residential mortgage loans, of which $2.1&nbsp;billion were held for sale.At December&nbsp;31, 2003, sub-prime residential mortgage loans outstanding were$1.9&nbsp;billion, of which $1.4&nbsp;billion were held for sale. Lending-relatedcommitments on 1&#150;4 family residential mortgages increased by $6.9&nbsp;billion, or24%, due to new business.Credit Cards: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managedbasis, which includes credit card receivables on the Consolidated balance sheetand those that have been securitized. Managed credit card receivables wereapproximately$50.5&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, a decrease of 2% compared with year-end 2003.The lower amount of receivables primarily reflects seasonal factors.Lending-related commitments on credit cards increased by $5.0&nbsp;billion, or 4%,due to new business.Automobile Financings: Automobile financings increased by $423&nbsp;million at March31, 2004, when compared with year-end 2003. This increase was driven byoriginations of $6.8&nbsp;billion during the first quarter of 2004, a 24% increaseover originations in the fourth quarter of 2003.Other Consumer: Other consumer loans of $7.4&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004,increased by 3% compared with year-end levels.63 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial and consumer nonperforming exposure and net charge-offsThe following table presents a summary of credit-related nonperforming, pastdue and net charge-off information for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;Total nonperforming assets (excluding purchased held-for-sale commercial loans)were $2.9&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004, a decline of $279&nbsp;million, or 9%, fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. The decline was primarily in the commercial portfolio, as aresult of gross charge-offs of $184&nbsp;million taken during the quarter.Commercial loan net charge-offs for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, were64 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)$102&nbsp;million, including $82&nbsp;million of recoveries, compared with $292&nbsp;millionof net charge-offs for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2003. The charge-offrate for commercial loans was 0.50% for the first quarter of 2004, comparedwith 0.04% for the fourth quarter of 2003 and 1.32% for the first quarter of2003. Commercial net charge-offs in 2004 are expected to decline, but at aslower pace than the decline experienced in the second half of 2003.For Credit Card loans on a reported basis, the net charge-off rate for thefirst quarter of 2004 was 6.30%, compared with 6.17% for the first quarter of2003 and down from 6.66% for the fourth quarter of 2003. Although netcharge-offs in the first quarter of 2004 were lower than in the prior-yearperiod, the increase in the net charge-off rate was driven by a lower averagebalance. Likewise, the credit card loan net charge-off rate on the securitizedcredit card portfolio for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, was 5.53%,down from 5.82% in the first quarter of 2003. The decrease was due to anaverage balance that increased at a rate greater than the increase in netcharge-offs during the first quarter of 2004. Management expects consumer netcharge-off rates to remain stable for the next several quarters.Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall: The allowance for credit losses decreased from December&nbsp;31, 2003, toMarch&nbsp;31, 2004 reflecting declines across all components of the allowance.Loans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of March&nbsp;31, 2004, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.The allowance has both specific and expected loss components and a residualcomponent. As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, management deemed the allowance to be adequate(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable). The allowance for loan losses declined by $403&nbsp;million fromyear-end 2003 and $1.1&nbsp;billion from March&nbsp;31, 2003.65 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $716&nbsp;million atMarch&nbsp;31, 2004, a decrease of $201&nbsp;million, or 22%, from year-end 2003. Thedecrease was primarily attributable to reduced credit exposure as well ascharge-offs taken.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $411&nbsp;million atMarch&nbsp;31, 2004, a decrease of $43&nbsp;million, or 9%, from year-end 2003. Thedecrease reflected improvement in credit quality.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.2&nbsp;billion at March31, 2004, a decline of $80&nbsp;million, or 4%, from year-end 2003. The decrease wasprimarily attributable to reduced credit card balances, which experiencedseasonal highs at year-end 2003, as well as lower manufactured housing netcharge-off rates.The residual component of the allowance was $816&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004, adecrease of $79&nbsp;million from year-end 2003. The reduction was a result ofcomplying with the Firm's internal policy of maintaining the residual componentwithin a target range of 10% to 20% of the total allowance, including theresidual component. At March&nbsp;31, 2004, the residual component representedapproximately 20% of the total allowance for loan losses. The formula-basedcommercial specific and expected components do not consider uncertainties inthe economic environment or the impact of concentrations in the commercial loanportfolio. These uncertainties are addressed by the residual component of theallowance, which incorporates management's judgment. If current trends incommercial loan quality continue, the Firm's policies may require a furtherreduction in the overall allowance, including the residual component.Lending-related commitments: To provide for the risk of loss inherent in theFirm's process of extending credit, management also computes specific andexpected loss components, as well as a residual component, for commerciallending-related commitments. These are computed using a methodology similar tothat used for the commercial loan portfolio, modified for expected maturitiesand probabilities of drawdown. This allowance, which is reported in Otherliabilities, was $297&nbsp;million, $324&nbsp;million and $436&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004,December&nbsp;31, 2003, and March&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively. The allowance forlending-related commitments decreased by $27&nbsp;million during the three monthsended March&nbsp;31, 2004, due to improvement in the credit quality of theportfolio.&nbsp;MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;Risk management processFor a discussion of the Firm's market risk management organization, see pages66-67 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Value-at-RiskJPMorgan Chase's statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the potential loss fromadverse market moves in an ordinary market environment and provides aconsistent cross-business measure of risk profiles and levels of riskdiversification. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VARcalculation that includes both trading and nontrading activities, including theprivate equity business. The Firm calculates VAR using a one-day time horizonand a 99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to incur lossesgreater than that predicted by VAR estimates only once every 100 trading days,or about 2.5 times a year. For the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, there were nodays on which actual Firmwide market risk-related losses exceeded corporateVAR. For a further discussion of the Firm's VAR methodology, see pages 67-68 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.The table below shows trading VAR by risk type. Details of the VAR exposuresare discussed in the Trading Risk section below.&nbsp;Trading VAR by risk type66 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading riskThe largest contributor to trading VAR in the first quarter of 2004 wasinterest rate risk, which includes credit spread risk. Before portfoliodiversification, interest rate risk accounted for roughly 54% of the averageTrading Portfolio VAR. The diversification effect, which on average reduced thedaily average Trading Portfolio VAR by $49.5&nbsp;million in the first quarter,reflects the fact that the largest losses for different positions and risks donot typically occur at the same time. The risk of a portfolio of positions istherefore usually less than the sum of the risks of the positions themselves.The degree of diversification is determined both by the extent to whichdifferent market variables tend to move together, and by the extent to whichdifferent businesses have similar positions.Average trading VAR rose to $105.5&nbsp;million from $94.5&nbsp;million in the previousquarter. The increase was driven by a rise in interest rate VAR, primarily dueto increased risk positions, greater market volatility and higher correlationbetween lines of business.In contrast, period-end VAR declined to $84.0&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004, from$103.2&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003, primarily driven by a decrease in interestrate VAR due to reduced risk positions and lower correlation between lines ofbusiness.For a complete discussion of the Firm's Trading Risk, see page 70 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report.VAR backtestingTo evaluate the soundness of its VAR model, the Firm conducts daily backtestingof VAR against actual financial results, based on daily market risk-relatedrevenue. Market risk-related revenue is defined as the daily change in value ofthe mark-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interestincome, brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue.The Firm's definition of market risk-related revenue is consistent with theFederal Reserve Board's implementation of the Basel Committee's market riskcapital rules. The histogram below illustrates the Firm's daily marketrisk-related revenue for trading businesses for the first quarter of 2004. Thechart shows that the Firm posted positive daily market risk-related revenue on61 out of 64&nbsp;days in the first quarter, with five days exceeding $100&nbsp;million.The inset graph looks at those days on which the Firm experienced tradinglosses and depicts the amount by which the VAR exceeded the actual loss on eachof those days. Losses were sustained on three days, with no loss greater than$10.6&nbsp;million, below the losses predicted by the VAR measure.67 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Economic-value stress testingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. JPMorgan Chase performs a number of different scenario-basedstress tests monthly. Three corporate-wide stress tests are performed on allbusiness lines with trading activity. Scenarios are continually reviewed andupdated to reflect changes in the Firm's risk profile and economic events.The following table represents the worst-case potential economic-valuestress-test loss (pre-tax) in the Firm's trading portfolio as predicted bystress-test scenarios:Trading economic value stress-test loss results &#150; pre-tax&nbsp;The worst-case results of the three corporate-wide stress tests are shownabove. These scenarios are based on historical events and incorporate economicrelationships among market prices. The March&nbsp;11, 2004 and the first quarter2004 maximum and minimum results are from the &#147;Equity Market Collapse&#148; stressscenario, which is broadly modeled on the events of October&nbsp;1987. Under thisscenario, there is a significant equity sell-off along with a decline in creditprices and interest rates rally in major currencies. Results from March&nbsp;11reflect equity cash underwriting and options positions held by the Firm on thatdate, which led to losses under the &#147;Equity Market Collapse&#148; stress scenario.Positions that drove the stress-test results subsequently declined and werematerially lower at the end of the first quarter of 2004.The December&nbsp;4, 2003, results are also from the &#147;Equity Market Collapse&#148;scenario. The fourth quarter 2003 maximum and minimum results are from the&#147;Bond Market Collapse&#148; stress scenario. Under this stress scenario, interestrates rise sharply in major currencies, accompanied by moderate credit spreadwidening and equity price declines. For a further discussion of the Firm'sstress testing methodology, see pages 68-69 of the 2003 Annual Report.68 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The Firm conducts simulations of NII for its nontrading activities under avariety of interest rate scenarios, which are consistent with the scenariosused for economic-value stress testing. NII stress tests measure the potentialchange in the Firm's NII over the next 12&nbsp;months. These stress tests highlightexposures to various rate-sensitive factors, such as the rates themselves(e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits and changes inproduct mix. The stress tests also take into account forecasted balance sheetchanges, such as asset sales and securitizations, as well as prepayment andreinvestment behavior.The following table shows the change in the Firm's NII over the next 12&nbsp;monthsthat would result from uniform increases or decreases of 100 basis points inall interest rates. For the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2004, JPMorgan Chase'slargest potential NII stress-test loss was estimated at $209&nbsp;million, primarilythe result of increased funding costs associated with a &#043;100 basis-pointsparallel change. JPMorgan Chase's NII stress-test loss of $102&nbsp;million for a- -100 basis-points parallel change is primarily the result of potentialcompression in deposit spreads associated with a further interest rate declinein a low rate environment.Nontrading NII stress-test loss results &#150; pre-tax&nbsp;However, JPMorgan Chase believes that the standard &#043;100/-100 basis-pointsparallel change stress-test scenarios do not adequately reflect the actualcomplexity of markets. To that end, the Firm also applies several additionalscenarios to test how NII would change in response to unlikely but plausibleevents in abnormal markets. The worse-case stress-test loss scenario simulatesthe yield curve and spread changes that occurred during 1994, when the FederalOpen Market Committee raised interest rates six times for a total of 250 basis points.This scenario indicates that the Firm's U.S. dollar NII stress-test loss wouldbe approximately $125&nbsp;million.Other statistical and nonstatistical risk measuresFor a discussion of the Firm's other risk measures, see page 69 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report.Capital allocation for market riskFor a discussion of the Firm's capital allocation for market risk, see page 71of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Risk monitoring and controlFor a discussion of the Firm's risk monitoring and control process, includinglimits, qualitative risk assessments, model review, and policies andprocedures, see pages 71-72 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.&nbsp;OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer topages 72-74 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.&nbsp;PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity risk management, refer topage 74 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. While JPMorgan Chase computesVAR on its public equity holdings, the potential loss calculated by VAR may notbe indicative of the loss potential for these holdings due to the fact thatmost of the positions are subject to sale restrictions and, often, representsignificant concentration of ownership. Because VAR assumes that positions canbe exited in a normal market, JPMorgan Chase believes that the VAR for publicequity holdings does not necessarily represent the true value-at-risk for theseholdings.&nbsp;SUPERVISION AND REGULATION&nbsp;The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-5 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Form 10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries could pay dividends to their respective bankholding companies, without the approval of their relevant banking regulators,in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $5.1billion at March&nbsp;31, 2004.69 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM&nbsp;The Firm's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral tounderstanding the reported results. The Firm's most complex accountingestimates require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assetsand liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and controlprocedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgmentsmade as part of such methods, are well controlled, independently reviewed andapplied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies andprocedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologiesoccurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates fordetermining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. For afurther description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involvingsignificant management valuation judgments, see pages 74-77 and the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements in JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Allowance for Credit LossesThe Firm's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assignedto a loan. Assuming, for all commercial loans, a one-notch downgrade in theFirm's internal risk ratings, the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans would increase by approximately $450&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004.Furthermore, assuming a 10% increase in the loss severity on all downgradednoncriticized loans, the allowance for commercial loans would increase byapproximately $50&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2004. These sensitivity analyses arehypothetical and should be used with caution. The purpose of these analyses isto provide an indication of the impact risk ratings and loss severity have onthe estimate of the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans. It is notintended to imply management's expectation of future deterioration in riskratings or changes in loss severity. Given the process the Firm follows indetermining risk ratings of its loans and assessing loss severity, managementbelieves the risk ratings and loss severity currently assigned to commercialloans are appropriate. Furthermore, the likelihood of a one-notch downgrade forall commercial loans within a short time frame is remote.Trading and Available-for-Sale PortfoliosThe following table summarizes the Firm's trading and available-for-saleportfolios by valuation methodology at March&nbsp;31, 2004:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSRs and certain other retained interestsFor a discussion of the most significant assumptions used to value theseretained interests, as well as the applicable stress tests for thoseassumptions, see Notes 13 and 16 on pages 100-103 and 107-109, respectively, ofJPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.&nbsp;ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS&nbsp;Consolidation of variable interest entitiesIn December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;) to addressvarious technical corrections and implementation issues that have arisen sincethe issuance of FIN 46. Effective March&nbsp;31, 2004, JPMorgan Chase implementedFIN 46R for all variableinterest entities (VIEs), excluding certain investments made by JPMP. Forfurther details regarding FIN 46, refer to Note 12 on pages 14-16 of this Form10-Q.Impairment of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securitiesIn March&nbsp;2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 03-1, determining themeaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to investmentsclassified as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under SFAS 115(including individual securities and investments in mutual funds) and toinvestments accounted for under the cost method. The provisions of this EITFare effective for reporting periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2004; thus, theFirm will implement the new provisions effective July&nbsp;1,70 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)2004.&nbsp;The Firm does not believe that the application of EITF Issue 03-1 willhave a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated financial statements.Accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transferIn December&nbsp;2003, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 03-3 (&#147;SOP 03-3&#148;),Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. SOP03-3 provides guidance on the accounting for differences between contractualand expected cash flows from the purchaser's initial investment in loans ordebt securities acquired in a transfer, if those differences are attributable,at least in part, to credit quality. Among other things, SOP 03-3: (1)prohibits the recognition of the excess of contractual cash flows over expectedcash flows as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual or valuation allowance atthe time of purchase; (2)&nbsp;requires that subsequent increases in expected cashflows be recognized prospectively through an adjustment of yield; and (3)requires that subsequent decreases in expected cash flows be recognized as animpairment. In addition, SOP 03-3 prohibits the creation or carrying over of avaluation allowance in the initial accounting of all loans within its scopethat are acquired in a transfer. SOP 03-3 becomes effective for loans or debtsecurities acquired in fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2004.Accounting for interest rate lock commitments (&#147;IRLCs&#148;)IRLCs associated with mortgages to be held for sale represent commitments toextend credit at specified interest rates. On March&nbsp;9, 2004, the Securities andExchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;105 &#150;Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments (&#147;SAB 105&#148;), whichsummarizes the views of the SEC staff regarding the application of GAAP to loancommitments accounted for as derivative instruments. SAB 105 states that thevalue of the servicing asset should not be included in the estimate of fairvalue of IRLCs. SAB 105 is applicable for all IRLCs accounted for asderivatives and entered into on or after April&nbsp;1, 2004.Prior to April&nbsp;1, 2004, JPMorgan Chase recorded IRLCs at estimated fair value.The fair value of IRLCs included an estimate of the value of the loan servicingright inherent in the underlying loan, net of the estimated costs to close theloan. Beginning April&nbsp;1, 2004, and as a result of SAB 105, there will be no fairvalue assigned to IRLCs on the date they are entered into, with any initialexpected gain being recognized upon the sale of the resultant loan. Also in connection with SAB 105, the Firm will record any changes inthe value of the IRLCs excluding the servicing asset component due to changesin interest rates after they are locked. Adopting SAB 105 will not have amaterial impact on the Firm's Consolidated financial statements.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn June&nbsp;2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted final rules underSection&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;Section&nbsp;404&#148;). Commencing withits 2004 Annual Report, JPMorgan Chase will be required to include a report ofmanagement of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting.The internal controlreport must include a statement: of management'sresponsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control overfinancial reporting for the Firm; of management's assessment of theeffectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as ofyear-end; of the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe Firm's internal control over financial reporting; and that the Firm'sindependent accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management'sassessment of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting, whichreport is also required to be filed as part of the Annual Report. The Firmintends to be in compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 when theybecome effective in 2004.71 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

Plaintiffs in these actions areindividual and institutional investors, including state pension funds, whopurchased debt securities issued by WorldCom pursuant to public offerings in1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001. JPMSI acted as an underwriter of the 1998, 2000 and2001 offerings and was an initial purchaser in the December&nbsp;2000 private bondoffering. In addition to JPMSI, JPMorgan Chase and, in two actions, J.P. MorganSecurities Ltd. (&#147;JPMSL&#148;) in its capacity as one of the underwriters of theinternational tranche of the 2001 offering, the defendants in various of theactions include other underwriters, certain executives of WorldCom andWorldCom's auditors. In the actions, plaintiffs allege that defendants knew, orwere reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the securities were sold toplaintiffs on the basis of misrepresentations and omissions of material factsconcerning the financial condition of WorldCom. The complaints against JPMorganChase, JPMSI and JPMSL assert claims under federal and state securities laws,under other state statutes and under common-law theories of fraud and negligentmisrepresentation.Commercial Financial Services litigation. JPMSI (formerly known as ChaseSecurities Inc.) has been named as a defendant in several actions that werefiled in or transferred to the U.S. District and Bankruptcy Courts for theNorthern District of Oklahoma or filed in Oklahoma state court beginning inOctober&nbsp;1999, arising from the failure of Commercial Financial Services, Inc.(&#147;CFSI&#148;). Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchasedapproximately $2.0&nbsp;billion (original face amount) of asset-backed securitiesissued by CFSI. The securities were backed by charged-off credit cardreceivables. In addition to JPMSI, the defendants in various of the actions arethe founders and key executives of CFSI, as well as its auditors and outsidecounsel. JPMSI is alleged to have been the investment bankers to CFSI and tohave acted as an initial purchaser and as placement agent in connection withthe issuance of certain of the securities. Plaintiffs allege that defendantsknew, or were reckless or negligent in not knowing, that the securities weresold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleading misrepresentations and omissionsof material facts. The complaints against JPMSI assert claims under theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, under the Oklahoma Securities Act and undercommon-law theories of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. In the actionsagainst JPMSI, damages in the amount of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion, allegedlysuffered as a result of defendants' misrepresentations and omissions, pluspunitive damages and interest, are being claimed. CFSI has commenced an actionagainst JPMSI in Oklahoma state court and has asserted claims against JPMSI forprofessional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.

A trial date on the adversary proceeding has been set forNovember&nbsp;1, 2004.IPO allocation litigation. Beginning in May&nbsp;2001, JPMorgan Chase and certain ofits securities subsidiaries were named, along with numerous other firms in thesecurities industry, as defendants in a large number of putative class actionlawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of NewYork. These suits purport to challenge alleged improprieties in the allocationof stock in various public offerings, including some offerings for which aJPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. The suits allege violations ofsecurities and antitrust laws arising from alleged material misstatements andomissions in registration statements and prospectuses for the initial publicofferings (&#147;IPOs&#148;) and alleged market manipulation with respect to aftermarkettransactions in the offered securities. The securities claims allege, amongother things, misrepresentation and market manipulation of the aftermarkettrading for these offerings by tying allocations of shares in IPOs toundisclosed excessive commissions paid to JPMorgan Chase and to requiredaftermarket purchase transactions by customers who received allocations ofshares in the respective IPOs, as well as allegations of misleading analystreports. The antitrust claims allege an illegal conspiracy to requirecustomers, in exchange for IPO allocations, to pay undisclosed and excessivecommissions and to make aftermarket purchases of the IPO securities at a pricehigher than the offering price as a precondition to receiving allocations. OnFebruary&nbsp;13, 2003, the Court denied the motions of JPMorgan Chase and others todismiss the securities complaints. On November&nbsp;3, 2003, the Court granteddefendants' motion to dismiss the antitrust claims relating to the IPOallocation practices. A separate antitrust claim alleging that JPMSI and theother underwriters conspired to fix their underwriting fees is in discovery.JPMorgan Chase has also received various subpoenas and informal requests fromgovernmental and other agencies seeking information relating to IPO allocationpractices. On February&nbsp;20, 2003, JPMSI reached a settlement with the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers (&#147;NASD&#148;) pursuant to which the NASD censuredJPMSI and fined it $6&nbsp;million for activities it found to constitute unlawfulprofit sharing by Hambrecht & Quist Group in the period immediately prior toand following its acquisition in 2000. In agreeing to the resolution of thecharges, JPMSI neither admitted nor denied the NASD's contentions. In lateSeptember JPMSI and the SEC agreed to resolve matters relating to the SEC'sinvestigation of JPMSI's IPO allocation practices during 1999 &#091;year&#093;, and 2000.The SEC alleged that JPMSI violated Rule&nbsp;101 of SEC Regulation&nbsp;M in certain&#147;hot&#148; IPOs by attempting to induce certain customers to place aftermarketorders for IPO shares before the IPO was completed. Also, in the case of oneIPO, the SEC alleged that JPMSI violated &#147;just and equitable principles oftrade&#148; under NASD Conduct Rule&nbsp;2110 by persuading at least one customer toaccept an allocation of shares in a &#147;cold&#148; IPO in exchange for a promise of anallocation of shares in an upcoming IPO78 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)that was expected to be oversubscribed. JPMSI neither admitted nor denied theSEC's allegations, but consented to a judgment (entered October&nbsp;1, 2003)enjoining JPMSI from future violations of Regulation&nbsp;M and NASD Conduct Rule2110 and requiring JPMSI to pay a civil penalty of $25&nbsp;million.Research analyst conflicts. On December&nbsp;20, 2002, the Firm reached a settlementagreement in principle with the SEC, the NASD, the New York Stock Exchange(&#147;NYSE&#148;), the New York State Attorney General's Office and the North AmericanSecurities Administrators Association, on behalf of state securitiesregulators, to resolve their investigations of JPMorgan Chase relating toresearch analyst independence. Pursuant to the agreement in principle, JPMorganChase, without admitting or denying the allegations concerning allegedconflicts, agreed, among other things: (i)&nbsp;to pay $50&nbsp;million for retrospectiverelief, (ii)&nbsp;to adopt internal structural and operational reforms that willfurther augment the steps it has already taken to ensure the integrity ofJPMorgan Chase analyst research, (iii)&nbsp;to contribute $25&nbsp;million spread overfive years to provide independent third-party research to clients and (iv)&nbsp;tocontribute $5&nbsp;million towards investor education. Mutually satisfactorysettlement documents have been negotiated and approved by the SEC, the NYSE,the NASD and the Texas State Securities Board. Mutually satisfactory settlementdocuments have been negotiated and approved by the regulatory authorities inall but a few states, and settlement documents are in the process of beingnegotiated with the remaining states. On October&nbsp;31, 2003, the Court enteredfinal judgment pursuant to the settlement with the SEC.JPMSI has been named as a co-defendant with nine other broker-dealers in twoactions involving allegations similar to those at issue in the regulatoryinvestigations: a putative class action filed in federal court in Colorado,seeking an unspecified amount of money damages for alleged violations offederal securities laws; and an action filed in West Virginia state court byWest Virginia's Attorney General, seeking recovery from the defendants in theaggregate of $5,000 for each of what are alleged to be hundreds of thousands ofviolations of the state's consumer protection statute. On August&nbsp;8, 2003, theplaintiffs in the Colorado action dismissed the complaint without prejudice.Motions to dismiss the West Virginia action and to disqualify private counselretained by the Attorney General to prosecute that action are pending.JPMSI was served by the SEC, NASD and NYSE on or about May&nbsp;30, 2003, withsubpoenas or document requests seeking information regarding certain presentand former officers and employees in connection with a follow-up to theregulatory investigations, this time focusing on whether particular individualsproperly performed supervisory functions regarding domestic equity research.The Firm is cooperating with the investigations, which continue.Litigation reserve and other. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Firmestablished a reserve of $900&nbsp;million related to costs anticipated to beincurred in connection with the various private litigation and regulatoryinquiries involving Enron and the other material legal actions, proceedings andinvestigations discussed above. In the second quarter of 2003, the Firm added$100&nbsp;million to the reserve related to Enron. Of the $1&nbsp;billion, $700&nbsp;millionwas allocated to the various cases, proceedings and investigations associatedwith Enron. The balance of $300&nbsp;million was allocated to the variouslitigations, proceedings and investigations involving the Firm's debt andequity underwriting activities and equity research practices. The reserve maybe revised in the future. As of March&nbsp;31, 2004, the Enron-related litigationreserve was $524&nbsp;million, and the balance of the $300&nbsp;million set aside atMarch&nbsp;31, 2004, was $219&nbsp;million.In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations for which thereserve has been established, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named asdefendants in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedingsarising in connection with their respective businesses. Additional actions,investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters,particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages orwhere the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number ofparties, the Firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of thepending matters (including the pending matters for which the reserve has beenestablished) will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of thesematters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to eachpending matter may be. Subject to the foregoing caveat, JPMorgan Chaseanticipates, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counseland after taking into account its litigation reserves, that the outcome of thelegal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pending against itshould not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financialcondition of the Firm, although the outcome of a particular proceeding or theimposition of a particular fine or penalty may be material to JPMorgan Chase'soperating results for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors,the size of the loss or liability and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income forthat period.Item&nbsp;2 Changes in Securities and Use of ProceedsDuring the first quarter of 2004, shares of common stock of J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. were issued in transactions exempt from registration under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof.
