 15Part IItem 2 (continued)On an operating basis, JPMorgan Chase's diluted earnings per share for thesecond quarter of 2001 were $0.33, compared with $0.70 in the first quarter of2001 and $0.89 in the second quarter of 2000. Operating earnings were $690million in the 2001 second quarter, compared with $1,436 million in the firstquarter of 2001 and $1,757 million one year ago. For the first half of 2001,operating earnings were $2,126 million, or $1.03 per share, as against $3,745million, or $1.90 per share, in last year's same period.Management also tracks the operating performance of JPMorgan Chase excludingJPMorgan Partners' ("JPMP") results. Over the past few years, volatile stockmarkets and financing environments have yielded significant fluctuations in thevalues of the securities held by JPMorgan Partners, resulting in unrealized andrealized valuation adjustments for various periods that have significantlyaffected, both favorably and unfavorably, the Firm's operating results.Excluding the results of JPMorgan Partners, operating earnings were $1,308million in the second quarter of 2001, compared with $1,461 million in the firstquarter of 2001 and $1,556 million in the 2000 second quarter. Operatingearnings excluding JPMP for the first six months of 2001 were $2,769 million,compared with $3,239 million in the first half of 2000.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================The contribution of JPMP to operating earnings per share was a loss of $0.31 inthe second quarter of 2001, compared with a $0.01 loss in the first quarter of2001 and income of $0.10 in the second quarter of 2000. Excluding the results ofJPMP, operating earnings per share were $0.64 in the second quarter of 2001.This compares with $0.71 in the first quarter of 2001 and $0.79 in the secondquarter of 2000. The annualized cash operating return on common equity for thesecond quarter of 2001 was 16.7% excluding the results of JPMorgan Partners.The impact of the amortization of intangibles was $0.09 per share in the secondquarter of 2001, $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2001 and $0.05 pershare one year ago.For a reconciliation of diluted EPS from reported net income to cash operatingearnings (excluding JPMP), see the table below.(a) Amortization of intangibles excludes $0.01 related to JPMP.================================================================================ -15-  16Part IItem 2 (continued)SUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER 2001 OPERATING RESULTS:Weak global market conditions adversely affected the results of the 2001 secondquarter. The decline in operating income was driven primarily by losses atJPMorgan Partners. (All periods in 2000 give pro forma effect to the purchase ofRobert Fleming Holdings Limited ("Flemings"), which is treated as if it hadoccurred at the beginning of that year.) - Results of JPMorgan Partners were negatively affected by $1.02 billion of write-downs and write-offs, particularly from telecommunications investments in the privately held portion of the portfolio. - Total operating expenses declined by 6%, or $315 million, from the first quarter of 2001 and declined by 4% from the second quarter of 2000. - Investment banking fees were down 1% from the first quarter, reflecting market share gains in a weaker market. - Treasury & Securities Services and Retail & Middle Market Financial Services posted solid results, with cash ROE in excess of 20% for each. - Investment Management & Private Banking expense initiatives led to 18% growth in cash operating earnings from a weak first quarter. Assets under management, associated management fees and cash operating earnings declined versus one year ago as a consequence of the weaker market conditions.Despite the poor performance in second quarter of 2001, management of JPMorganChase continues to believe in the long-term value of the Firm's business model,which combines the best of an investment bank and a commercial bank. In adifficult business environment, the Firm maintained during the first six monthsof 2001, its position as No. 1 arranger of leveraged and syndicated loans and asNo. 2 arranger of U.S. high-grade bonds. The Firm improved its global announcedmergers and acquisitions ("M&A") ranking to No. 5, as compared with No. 7 duringthe same period one year ago. Management reiterated its commitment to capitaldiscipline, as evidenced by the common stock repurchase authorization discussedmore fully below, and to continued expense discipline. JPMorgan Chase continuesto target cash operating expenses for full-year 2001 to be lower than cashoperating expenses for full-year 2000.Nonperforming assets were $2.50 billion at June 30, 2001, compared with $2.23billion and $2.04 billion at March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2000, respectively. Theincrease from March 31 primarily relates to U.S. commercial and industrialloans. Net charge-offs on a managed basis (i.e., treating securitized creditcard receivables as if owned by JPMC) were $798 million in the 2001 secondquarter, up from $688 million in the first quarter of 2001 and $577 million inthe second quarter of 2000.Total assets as of June 30, 2001 were $713 billion, compared with $714 billionas of March 31, 2001 and $662 billion one year ago. JPMorgan Chase's Tier Onecapital ratio was 8.7% at June 30, 2001 and at March 31, 2001 and 8.6% oneyear ago.JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2001 special items were $478 million (pre-tax)of merger and restructuring costs. Special items in the second quarter of 2000included a $141 million loss resulting from the economic hedge of the purchaseprice of Flemings prior to its acquisition and $50 million of restructuringcosts associated with previously announced relocation initiatives.COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION:The Board of Directors of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has authorized, effective July19, 2001, the repurchase of up to $6 billion of JPMorgan Chase's common stock inthe open market or through negotiated transactions. This authorization is inaddition to any amounts necessary to provide for issuances under JPMorganChase's dividend reinvestment plan and its various stock-based director andemployee benefits plans.MERGER UPDATE: - The merger of Chase Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. occurred on May 1, 2001. The merger of The Chase Manhattan Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York currently is scheduled to occur in October 2001. - JPMC management anticipates that revenue synergies from the merger for full-year 2001 are likely to be lower than previously estimated because of weak market conditions. The level of M&A and equity underwriting activity are not expected to improve in the second half of 2001. - Total expense savings are expected to be larger than originally estimated for 2001 and in excess of the original three year target of $2 billion. -16-  17Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The table below provides summary financial information on a cash operating basisfor the five major business segments. All periods below have been restated on acomparable basis to reflect the changes in capital allocation adopted in thefirst quarter of 2001; restatements may occur in future periods to reflectfurther alignment of management accounting policies or changes in organizationalstructures between businesses.Shareholder Value Added ("SVA") is JPMorgan Chase's primary performance measureof its businesses. SVA represents operating earnings excluding the amortizationof goodwill and certain other intangibles (i.e., cash operating earnings) minuspreferred dividends and an explicit charge for capital. During the first quarterof 2001, JPMorgan Chase adopted a new framework for capital allocation and forbusiness performance measurement across the Firm. The SVA framework now utilizesa 12% cost of equity capital for each business, with the exception of JPMorganPartners. That business is charged a 15% cost of equity capital, which isequivalent to a representative after-tax hurdle rate for private equityinvestments. The effective cost of equity capital used in the SVA framework forJPMorgan Chase overall is 12%. For a discussion of each business profile, seepages 28-36 of the JPMorgan Chase 2000 Annual Report.================================================================================(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000 and primarily affected Investment Bank, Investment Management & Private Banking and total consolidated results.(b) Includes LabMorgan, Support Units and the effects remaining at the corporate level after the implementation of management accounting policies.NM - Not meaningful.================================================================================ -17-  18Part IItem 2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKThe following table sets forth selected financial data of the Investment Bank.================================================================================(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================(All comments related to 2000 give pro forma effect to the purchase of Flemings,which is treated as if it had occurred at the beginning of that year.)The Investment Bank's operating revenue in the second quarter of 2001 was $3.78billion, down 11% from the second quarter of 2000 and for the first half of theyear was $8.21 billion, down 9% from last year. The declines in revenue wereprimarily a consequence of the continuing difficult market environment in 2001.Cash operating expense declined 8% from the second quarter of 2000 and 7% fromthe first six months of 2000, benefiting from expense discipline that includednet headcount reductions in excess of 3,000 since the start of the year andlower incentive accruals. Further net headcount reductions and expensereductions are planned as the merger integration continues through 2001 and2002. Cash operating earnings declined 20% from the second quarter of 2000 and17% from the first half of 2000.Trading revenue (including the associated net interest income ("NII")) of $1.61billion in the second quarter declined by 11% from the second quarter of 2000.Year-to-date trading revenue was lower by 6%, compared with the same period lastyear. The declines were a result of overall challenging market conditions andslower market activity and were experienced across most of the Firm's tradingactivities. For additional comments on trading revenue products, see page28. Trading-related revenue for the remainder of the year is likely to be lowerthan trading-related revenue realized in the first half of 2001 due to bothseasonal patterns and market conditions.Investment banking fees declined by 21% from the second quarter of 2000 and by22% from the first half of 2000. The declines were driven by the lower level ofM&A and equity underwriting activity in 2001. Investment banking revenues forthe remainder of the year will be largely dependent upon the level of marketactivity for underwriting and M&A advisory work, which are currently expected toremain at the same weak levels as experienced during the first half of the year.Double-digit percentage decreases in fees and commissions from both the secondquarter and first half of last year were driven by lower equity brokeragecommissions.All other revenue includes securities gains and reflected increases insecurities gains of $70 million in the second quarter of 2001 and $247 millionin the first half of 2001. The increases are the result of the Firm'sasset/liability management ("A/L") activities in a declining interest rateenvironment.The Investment Bank's cash overhead ratio for the second quarter of 2001 was 63%and 61% for the first half of 2001. The Investment Bank is targeting a cashoverhead ratio of 60% for the full-year 2001 assuming no further deteriorationin market conditions. -18-  19Part IItem 2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERSThe following table sets forth selected financial data of JPMorgan Partners.================================================================================(in millions, except ratios)NM - Not meaningful.================================================================================JPMorgan Partners generated net private equity losses of $827 million in thesecond quarter of 2001, compared with gains of $447 million in the secondquarter of 2000. Included in the second quarter of 2001 were write-downs andwrite-offs of $1.02 billion taken on JPMP's direct private investments and fundpositions as a result of lower overall valuation levels of its investments.A majority of the write-downs and write-offs were associated with technology,media and telecommunications ("TMT") investments, with particular focus ontransactions funded during 1999 and 2000. During this period, investments madein the TMT sector reflected historically high valuations. JPMP's TMT investmentsfrom 1999 and 2000 currently are valued at 55% of initial cost. (Exclusive ofinvestments with increased valuation adjustments recognized upon the initialpublic offering of such securities or as a result of an additional round ofprivate financing). At June 30, 2001, TMT investments represented approximately32% of the total of JPMP's portfolio.The carrying values of the equity investments recorded on JPMC's financialstatements are net of interests of investors other than JPMC. JPMP has soldinterests in certain of its fund investments to unaffiliated third parties andis in the process of offering interests in a new investment fund that willco-invest with JPMP in its direct investments. As a result, JPMC's proportionalownership share of investments to be made by JPMP in the future will be reduced. -19-  20Part IItem 2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOThe following table presents the carrying values and costs of the JPMPinvestment portfolio for the dates indicated.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Publicly traded positions only.(b) Represents the number of companies and funds at June 30, 2001.================================================================================The following table presents information about the 10 largest holdings of publicsecurities in the JPMP investment portfolio.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Policy: Public securities held by JPMorgan Partners are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less liquidity discounts, with the resulting unrealized gains/losses included in the income statement. JPMorgan Partners' valuation policy for public securities incorporates the use of liquidity discounts and price averaging methodologies in certain circumstances to take into account the fact that JPMorgan Partners cannot immediately realize the quoted public values as a result of the regulatory, corporate and contractual sales restrictions generally imposed on these holdings. Private investments are initially carried at cost, which is viewed as an approximation of fair value. The carrying value of private investments is adjusted to reflect valuation changes resulting from unaffiliated party transactions and for evidence of a decline in value.================================================================================The Firm continues to believe JPMP's equity-related investments will createlong-term value for JPMC. During the first half of 2001, JPMP invested $0.5billion in direct equity. The pace of investments may increase over the next12-18 months. JPMP intends to increase industry and geographic diversificationin its portfolio over time. The Firm is currently prepared to commit at least$1.5 billion of its own funds to JPMP in each of the next four years. -20-  21Part IItem 2 (continued)INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGThe following table reflects selected financial data for Investment Management &Private Banking ("IMPB").(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM - Not meaningful.================================================================================(All comments related to 2000 give pro forma effect to the purchase of Flemings,which is treated as if it had occurred at the beginning of that year.)IMPB had operating revenues of $788 million, down 15% from the second quarter of2000. For the first half of 2001, revenues decreased 19% from the same period ayear ago. The declines were mainly due to lower investment fees as a result ofthe lower values of funds under management in a weaker market environment. Alsoa consequence of the weaker markets was the reduction in brokerage commissionsand trading revenues that are related to the wealth management activities ofPrivate Banking.IMPB's cash operating expenses of $644 million declined 6% from both the secondquarter of 2001 and the first half of 2000, driven by lower compensationexpense. Cash operating earnings were $117 million, down from $159 million inthe second quarter of 2000. For the first half of 2001, cash operating earningswere $216 million, a 40% decline from 2000.The table below reflects the assets under management in IMPB as of June 30, 2001and 2000, respectively.(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.================================================================================Market conditions in the second quarter of 2001 led to a 6% decline in assetsunder management from the second quarter of 2000 level. This excludes assetsmanaged by other lines of business and assets attributable to the Firm's 45%interest in American Century Companies, Inc. ("American Century"). -21-  22Part IItem 2 (continued)TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESThe following table sets forth selected financial data of Treasury & SecuritiesServices ("T&SS").bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Treasury & Securities Services' operating revenues were $909 million in thesecond quarter of 2001 and $1,816 million in the first half of this year, anincrease of 1% and 3% from the respective periods last year. Revenues werestronger for Treasury Services and Institutional Trust, reflecting new businessand higher volume from existing customers, partially offset by the negativeeffect of declining short-term interest rates on deposits. Revenue declines atInvestor Services were primarily the result of lower asset-based fees, lowerforeign exchange and reduced net asset growth.Cash expense in the second quarter of 2001 rose 3%, resulting in a 3% decline incash operating earnings. For the first six months of 2001, however, cash expensegrew by only 2%, contributing to an increase in cash operating earnings of 4%.Under current market conditions, revenue growth at Investor Services will beslower in 2001 than in 2000. Expense discipline will continue, and management isstill working towards its previously-announced long-term targeted cash overheadratio for T&SS of approximately 65%. -22-  23Part IItem 2 (continued)RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICESThe following table reflects selected financial data for Retail & Middle MarketFinancial Services ("RMMFS").(a) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM - Not meaningful.================================================================================Operating revenue for RMMFS in the second quarter of 2001 rose to $2.64 billion,5% over last year's second quarter and, for the first six months, revenueincreased to $5.20 billion, 6% over the first half of 2000. These increases areattributable to significant increases in business volumes. Home Finance,Cardmember Services and Auto Finance, realized substantial increases inoriginations. In addition, comparisons to the first six months of 2000 benefitfrom the $100 million charge for auto lease residual taken in the first quarterof 2000. The risk of future charges for residual values has been substantiallymitigated in the first quarter of 2001 by obtaining a residual value insurancepolicy to cover previously uninsured auto leases in the portfolio.Cash operating expenses of $1.34 billion in the second quarter of 2001 increased4% from last year's quarter but were relatively flat in the first half of 2001versus the first half of 2000. Cash operating earnings in the second quarterdecreased by 3% from the same quarter in 2000, partly as a result of the sale ofthe consumer banking operations in Hong Kong and Panama at the end of 2000. Forthe first half of 2001, however, cash operating earnings increased by 10% fromthe first half of 2000, reflecting the benefit of operating efficiencies and the$100 million charge in 2000 mentioned above. -23-  24Part IItem 2 (continued)Management's goal is double-digit cash operating earnings growth for RMMFS in2001. Current conditions in the mortgage market may continue to affect adverselythe valuation of mortgage servicing rights and may impact management's abilityto meet this target.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within RMMFS. -24-  25Part IItem 2 (continued)CARDMEMBER SERVICESCardmember Services operating revenues were up 15% for the second quarter and12% for the first six months of 2001 compared with the same periods last year.Cash operating earnings were up 7% and 14% for the second quarter and first sixmonths of 2001, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2000. The higherrevenue was driven by an increase in new accounts over the last severalquarters, higher purchase volume and higher fee-based revenue. Credit cardoutstandings grew by 16% from one year ago and over two million newaccounts were added in the first six months of 2001. The increase in cashoperating earnings was partially offset by higher expenses reflecting higherbusiness volumes and higher marketing costs. In addition, credit costs increasedin the 2001 second quarter reflecting the slowing economy and higher bankruptcyfilings.REGIONAL BANKING GROUPRegional Banking Group's operating revenues for the second quarter of 2001 andthe first six months of 2001 declined slightly from the respective periods of2000, and cash operating earnings for the second quarter of 2001 and the firstsix months of 2001 declined 9% and 5%, when compared with the second quarter andfirst half of 2000, respectively. These results reflect the adverse effects ofdeclining interest rates on deposit spreads and lower investment brokeragevolume as a result of weaker market conditions in 2001.HOME FINANCEHome Finance's operating revenues and cash operating earnings each rose 25% inthe second quarter of 2001 versus the prior year's quarter and were up 16% and24%, respectively, for the first six months of 2001 over the same period lastyear. The increases in 2001 were due to a 200% growth in origination volume, a24% growth in servicing balances and higher net interest margin. Home Financerevenues were reduced in the first half of 2001 by $207 million, due toimpairments on MSRs and other assets, partially offset by gains on hedginginstruments, AFS securities and other derivative instruments. This reduction inrevenue resulted from accelerated prepayments due to the decline in interestrates. Originations (residential, home equity and manufactured housing) for thesecond quarter of 2001 were $54 billion, a record level, and includedoriginations from the retail, wholesale and correspondent (traditional andnegotiated) channels. The Home Finance servicing portfolio exceeded $400 billionat June 30, 2001.MIDDLE MARKETSMiddle Markets' operating revenues and cash operating earnings for the secondquarter of 2001 declined 5% and 16%, respectively, from the second quarter of2000. Operating revenues and cash operating earnings each were essentially flat,compared with the first six months of 2000. The decrease in cash operatingearnings in the second quarter reflected the negative impact of narrower spreadson deposits, partially offset by higher deposit volume.AUTO FINANCEAuto Finance's operating revenues and cash operating earnings were $242 millionand $56 million, respectively, in the first half of 2001. Year-to-date autooriginations of $9 billion, a record increase in origination volume, the impactof lower interest rates, and the effect of a $100 million charge recognized lastyear for the estimated decrease in auto lease residual value contributed to thegrowth over last year.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's support units include LabMorgan, Enterprise Technology Servicesand Corporate Business Services.For the second quarter of 2001, Support Units and Corporate had a cash operatingloss of $26 million, compared with a cash operating loss of $41 million in thesecond quarter of 2000. Included in the second quarter of 2001 was a net loss atLabMorgan primarily as a result of a $30 million (pre-tax) write-down ofinvestments and equity investment losses. -25-  26Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations on both a reported and operating basis. The table below provides areconciliation between the Firm's reported and operating results.(a) Represents condensed results as reported in JPMorgan Chase's financial statements.(b) This column excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. For receivables that have been securitized, amounts that would have been reported as net interest income and as provision for loan losses are instead reported as components of noninterest revenue.(c) Includes merger and restructuring costs and special items. The 2001 second quarter and six months include $478 million and $806 million (pre-tax), respectively, in merger and restructuring expenses. The 2000 second quarter and six months included a $141 million loss (pre-tax) resulting from the economic hedge of the purchase price of Flemings prior to its acquisition and $50 million (pre-tax) of restructuring costs associated with previously announced relocation initiatives.(d) Includes the effect of the accounting change. Excluding the accounting change, basic and diluted net income per share for the first six months of 2001 were $0.79 and $0.77, respectively.================================================================================ -26-  27Part IItem 2 (continued)REVENUES(a) Pro forma revenue assumes that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.================================================================================INVESTMENT BANKING FEESInvestment banking fees in the second quarter and first half of 2001 declinedsignificantly from last year's respective periods. The declines were due to themuch weaker market for all products, including M&A advisory, loan syndicationand securities underwriting. -27-  28Part IItem 2 (continued)TRADING-RELATED REVENUETrading-related revenue (including associated NII) in the second quarter of 2001was lower by 15% from last year's same period and for the first six months wasdown 8% from 2000. The declines were due to challenging market conditions, whichreduced the overall volume of activities and volatility. Also contributing tothe depressed levels were the losses realized on economic hedges of mortgageservicing rights at Home Finance.(a) Trading-related revenue includes net interest income attributable to trading activities. Trading-related net interest income has been restated in the prior periods in order to conform to the current presentation.(b) Includes equity securities and equity derivatives revenue.(c) Includes credit-related products such as bonds and commercial paper issued by U.S. and non-U.S. entities, as well as credit derivatives revenue.(d) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts, excluding emerging markets product revenues.(e) Includes various types of interest rate products across bonds and derivatives, combined with commodities and other trading revenue.(f) Derivative and foreign exchange contracts are marked-to-market, and valuation adjustments are included in trading-related revenue.(g) Includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions, as well as management allocations reflecting the funding costs or benefits associated with trading positions. These amounts are included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.================================================================================ - Revenues from equities were down 10% from the first half of last year due to difficulties in the equities market, particularly lower over-the-counter activities. This was partly offset by the strong demand for equity derivatives, one of the Firm's product capabilities strengthened by the merger. - The declines of debt instruments from both periods largely reflected the less active market for these products. - The lower levels of foreign exchange revenues were a result of the much slower environment for foreign currency flows, when compared with last year. - Interest rate contracts, commodities and other in the 2001 second quarter and six months were lower than the second quarter of 2000 but were 26% higher than the first half of last year. Results for the six months of 2001 were primarily driven by the results of the first quarter, which benefited from the increased market demand for interest rate contracts and which produced volatility in their prices as a result of the substantial decline in interest rates during the first quarter. -28-  29Part IItem 2 (continued)FEES AND COMMISSIONSFees and commissions for the second quarter of 2001 rose 11%, when compared withthe second quarter of 2000 and for the first six months increased slightlyversus last year's same period. The table below provides the significantcomponents of fees and commissions.Investment Management, Custody and Processing ServicesInvestment management, custody and processing services fees in the secondquarter of 2001 rose 10% from the prior year's quarter and 16% from the firstsix months of 2000. Investment management fees were higher than last year,primarily as a result of the contributions of Flemings, which increased thelevel of funds under management. Custody and processing services decreasedslightly from the second quarter of 2000 but increased from the first six monthsof 2000. The decrease for the quarter was largely due to the impact of lowersecurity values on custody fees, partly offset by higher institutional trustfees related to new business and increased volume from existing clients. Theincrease for the first half reflected the higher aforementioned institutionaltrust fees from new business and cash management fees related to treasuryactivities.Credit Card RevenueThe increases in credit card revenue for the second quarter and first half of2001 reflect the impact of an increase in average receivables outstanding andhigher late and overlimit fees. The increases also reflect higher interchangeincome due to stronger customer purchase volume, as well as higher otherfee-based revenue.The following table reconciles JPMorgan Chase's reported credit card revenue andoperating credit card revenue (which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations).Brokerage and Investment ServicesBrokerage and investment services in the 2001 second quarter increased $62million from the prior year's same quarter and $99 million in the first sixmonths of 2001 as a result of the Flemings acquisition. This increase was partlyoffset by the effect of the weaker markets that reduced the volume ofinstitutional brokerage and retail investment activities. -29-  30Part IItem 2 (continued)Mortgage Servicing FeesMortgage servicing fees in the second quarter and first half of 2001 declined$56 million and $439 million from the same periods last year, respectively,reflecting the net impact of mortgage servicing rights related impairment due tothe decline in mortgage rates. Securities gains of $315 million for the firsthalf of 2001 partially offset the decline in mortgage servicing fees. Securitiesare used to economically hedge the mortgage servicing rights. While lowermortgage rates had a negative impact on mortgage servicing revenue, they had apositive impact on loan origination revenue through increased residentialmortgage originations.Other Lending-Related Service FeesOther lending-related service fees were lower by $32 million than the secondquarter of 2000 and $52 million than the first six months of last year. Thedeclines were primarily attributable to the repositioning of the trade financebusiness.Deposit Service ChargesDeposit service charges in the 2001 second quarter increased $32 million fromthe prior year's quarter and for the first six months of 2001 increased by $37million from the prior year. The increases reflected the impact of the lowerinterest rates as customers who customarily would pay for deposit products andservices by maintaining a higher level of compensating balances instead reducedtheir balances and paid for the services through separate fees. Alsocontributing to the increase were new pricing schedules implemented for thedeposit products in the second quarter of 2001.Other FeesThe increases in all other fees of $58 million and $75 million in the secondquarter and first six months of 2001 from the same periods in the prior year,respectively, primarily reflected the growth in the volume of variable annuitysales. Also contributing to the increases were the acquisitions of Flemings andColson Services Corp., a provider of record keeping, paying agent and otherfinancial services.PRIVATE EQUITY GAINSPrivate equity gains (losses) were significantly affected by the downturn in theequities market. In the second quarter of 2001, both realized and unrealizedcategories had losses. These unfavorable results were attributable to write-offsand write-downs, particularly in JPMP's investment in the technology, media andtelecommunications sectors. In addition, the ability of JPMP to realize cashgains upon the sale of an investment has become more difficult, as the weakerinitial public offering and M&A environment during the first six months of 2001has limited JPMP's ability to implement various "exit" strategies for itsinvestments. For a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equityresults, see the JPMP line of business results on pages 19-20 of this Form 10-Q.SECURITIES GAINSSecurities gains in the second quarter of 2001 were up $43 million from lastyear's same quarter. For the first half, gains were $501 million above the sameperiod last year. These increases resulted from the decline ininterest rates since the fourth quarter of 2000, compared with the rateincreases in the same period last year. As a consequence of the interest ratedeclines in the first half of 2001, the value of debt securities held this yearrose and produced significant gains upon the sale of those securities.Home Finance utilized debt securities in addition to derivatives to hedge thevalue of the mortgage servicing rights it carries on the Balance Sheet. In the2001 first quarter, Home Finance realized $315 million of gains from the sale ofdebt securities used to economically hedge the mortgage servicing rights whichpartially offset the decline in mortgage servicing fees. In the 2001 secondquarter, no material gains were recorded from the sale of securities. (However,hedge contracts were acquired to cover impairment losses and the results wererecorded within mortgage servicing fees.) -30-  31Part IItem 2 (continued)OTHER REVENUEResidential mortgage activities (which include originations and sales of loansand selective dispositions of mortgage servicing rights) in the 2001 secondquarter and first six months rose $105 million and $160 million, respectively,from the comparable periods last year. The increases were the result of thehigher volume of mortgage loans sold in 2001. The decline in mortgage interestrates and a strong housing market led to the growth of residential loanoriginations.All other revenue decreased $36 million in the second quarter of this yearversus the 2000 second quarter and decreased $160 million in the 2001 first sixmonths compared with the prior year. These decreases were attributable to lowerequity income from the American Century investment, reflecting the decline inthe value of its funds under management. In addition, the second quarter andfirst half of 2001 included lower results related to economic hedges for plannedoverseas revenues.On a reported basis, the second quarter and six months of 2000 results alsoincluded a $141 million loss resulting from the economic hedge for the purchaseprice of Flemings prior to its acquisition. (The offsetting appreciation in thedollar versus pound sterling exchange rate was reflected as a reduction in thepurchase price and corresponding goodwill.)NET INTEREST INCOMEOPERATING NII adjusts reported NII for the impact of credit card securitizationsand trading-related NII that is considered part of total trading-relatedrevenue. The following table reconciles reported and operating NII.Net Interest Income in the 2001 second quarter and first six months, both on areported and operating basis, grew from the comparable periods last year,primarily as a result of the interest rate environment this year. Since thestart of 2001, the lower interest rate environment contributed to growth inconsumer loans, and a decline in the funding costs to support these loans. Lastyear, on the other hand, interest rates were on the rise, and this depressed thegrowth of, and spread on, interest earning assets.Also contributing to the increase in both 2001 periods was the receipt in thesecond quarter of 2001 of several interest refunds aggregating $71 million onprior years' taxes. The first quarter of 2000 included a charge of $100 millionfor an estimated decrease in the residual value of auto leases. -31-  32Part IItem 2 (continued)NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal operating noninterest expenses were $5.3 billion in the second quarter of2001, up 5% from the second quarter of 2000. The increase reflected the higherinvestments in businesses and, in particular, the acquisition of Flemings. On apro forma basis, total 2001 operating expenses declined from last year as aresult of focused expense management initiatives, which include headcountreductions. The following table presents the components of noninterest expenseon an operating and reported basis.(a) Pro forma expense treats the purchase of Flemings as if it had occurred at the beginning of 2000.(b) The overhead ratio is defined as noninterest expense as a percentage of total operating revenue (excluding merger and restructuring costs and special items). The cash overhead ratio also excludes the impact of the amortization of intangibles.================================================================================COMPENSATION EXPENSECompensation expense rose 3% from the 2000 second quarter and 2% from the firsthalf of last year. The increases were attributable to the additions of Flemingsand the mortgage business of Advanta. Partially offsetting the increases werethe effect of headcount reductions, in particular in the Investment Bank andInvestment Management & Private Banking, and lower incentive costs as a resultof the decrease in revenues. Further reductions in headcount are anticipatedduring the rest of the year and in 2002.The increase in full-time equivalent employees was attributable to theacquisition of Flemings and the mortgage business of Advanta.OCCUPANCY EXPENSEThe increases from the second quarter and first half of last year reflectedFlemings, as well as growing occupancy requirements of Investment Bank, IMPB andT&SS. Also contributing to the increases were higher leasing costs for severallocations. These increases were partially offset by the impact of relocations ofcertain T&SS operations from the New York area to the South and Southwest.TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONSTechnology and Communications expense rose from both the second quarter andfirst half of 2000, primarily due to the addition of Flemings and thedepreciation of more sophisticated hardware systems and software applicationsthroughout the Firm. The increases also were attributable to higher leasing ofand maintenance expenses for advanced computer and other office equipment. -32-  33Part IItem 2 (continued)OTHER EXPENSEOther expense declined 5% from the second quarter and 1% from the first half of2000. The following table presents the components of other expense.- - The increase in PROFESSIONAL SERVICES for the first half of 2001 was mainly driven by higher applications and systems consulting services to support various business-related projects.- - OUTSIDE SERVICES increased in both periods of 2001, primarily due to higher outside data processing fees related to the rise in volume of activities at Home Finance and Investor Services.- - MARKETING expense rose for the six months of 2001, principally due to the branding campaigns to introduce the new Firm, coupled with more active efforts to reach retail customers nationwide, particularly for the credit card business.- - The increase in TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT in both periods of 2001 reflected the higher travel and hotel expenses in connection with global businesses generated by the Investment Bank, coupled with nonreservable activities related to the merger.- - The declines in ALL OTHER expense of 21% for the second quarter and 14% for the first half of 2001 were partly the result of decreases in recruitment costs associated with the reduced requirements across the Firm.AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLESThe increases in amortization of intangibles over both periods in 2000 wereattributable to the acquisitions of Flemings and The Beacon Group, LLC in thethird quarter of 2000.MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTSThe Firm incurred $478 million of restructuring costs in the second quarter of2001 related to previously announced merger actions and relocation and otherbusiness initiatives ($405 million and $73 million, respectively). Under currentaccounting pronouncements, these costs (primarily systems integration costs,facilities costs and retention payments) are not recognized until incurred. Fora further discussion of JPMorgan Chase's merger and restructuring costs, referto Note 4 of this Form 10-Q and Note 7 and page 42 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000Annual Report.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs on an operating basis are composed of the provision for loan lossesrelated to loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to the credit costsassociated with credit card receivables that have been securitized.Credit costs in the second quarter and six months of 2001 increased $228 millionand $320 million, respectively, as a result of increases in charge-offs in thecommercial loan portfolios, primarily in the telecommunications industry, and inthe consumer loan portfolio due to increased bankruptcies. See page 39 of thisForm 10-Q for a discussion of the allowance for credit losses. -33-  34Part IItem 2 (continued)INCOME TAXESJPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of $207 million in the secondquarter of 2001 compared with $863 million in the second quarter of 2000. Forthe first half of 2001, JPMorgan Chase recorded income tax expense of $863million, compared with $1,949 million for the first half of 2000. The effectivetax rates were 35.4% in the second quarter of 2001 and 35.0% in the first halfof 2001, compared with 34.6% and 35.0% in the second quarter of 2000 and firsthalf of 2000, respectively.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------JPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational andliquidity risk. For a discussion of these risks and definition of termsassociated with managing these risks, please refer to the Glossary of Terms onpage 50 of this Form 10-Q and pages 43-59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 AnnualReport.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 2000 and should be read in conjunction withpages 46-53 and 67-68 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm's credit-related information for the datesindicated. (a) Charge-offs for derivative receivables are included in trading revenue. (b) Includes credit card receivables that have been securitized. (c) Nonperforming assets have not been reduced for credit protection (single name credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) aggregating $112 million related to nonperforming counterparties. (d) Annualized.================================================================================ -34-  35Part IItem 2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's managed credit-related assets of $307 billion at June 30, 2001decreased 1%, when compared with year-end 2000. Commercial loans decreased $6.7billion, or 6%, reflecting the Firm's ongoing discipline of originating loansfor distribution and sale. Derivative and foreign exchange instruments decreasedby 10% from $76.4 billion at year-end 2000. Consumer managed credit-relatedassets increased $10.4 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2000, largely in the1-4 family residential mortgage and auto finance portfolios.The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily related to three domesticcommercial credits. The portion of the commercial loan portfolio andcounterparty credit outstanding considered investment grade was 67% at June 30,2001, unchanged from year-end 2000. Management currently believes that creditconditions in the United States will remain challenging over the remainder ofthe year, which could cause a further increase in nonperforming assets in 2001.However, management believes that JPMC's credit performance this year willcontinue to be better than the industry average.Net charge-offs in the managed portfolio were $798 million and $1,486 million inthe second quarter and six months 2001, respectively, an increase of $221million and $322 million, respectively, from the same periods one year ago,primarily reflecting increased net charge-offs in the telecommunications portionof the domestic commercial loan portfolio and in the consumer credit cardportfolio.For the remainder of the year, management expects commercial loan netcharge-offs to remain at approximately the same level as in the first half ofthe year.COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO -35-  36Part IItem 2 (continued)(a) Charge-offs for derivative receivables are included in trading revenue.(b) Nonperforming assets have not been reduced for credit protection (single name credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) aggregating $112 million related to nonperforming counterparties.(c) Annualized.NM - Not meaningful.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL: The domestic commercial and industrial portfoliodecreased $1.1 billion from 2000 year-end. Domestic commercial and industrialnet charge-offs in the 2001 second quarter amounted to $158 million, comparedwith $64 million in the 2000 second quarter. Nonperforming domestic commercialand industrial loans were $1.2 billion, an increase of $484 million from the2000 year-end. The foreign commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $34.1billion at June 30, 2001, a decrease of 8% from the 2000 year-end level.Nonperforming foreign commercial and industrial loans were $312 million, adecrease of $244 million from year-end 2000 due in large part to continuingimprovement in the Asian loan portfolio. Net charge-offs in the foreigncommercial and industrial loan portfolio for the second quarter of 2001increased to $39 million, from $21 million in the same period last year.The telecommunications credit-related asset portfolio at June 30, 2001 was $10.1billion, representing 5.5% of total JPMorgan Chase commercial credit-relatedassets, which is consistent with the Firm's strategy of maintaining portfoliodiversification. The portion of the telecommunications portfolio consideredinvestment grade as of June 30, 2001 was 60%, which compares with 67% for theaggregate portfolio. At June 30, 2001, 2.3% of the telecommunications portfoliowas nonperforming. The more traditional (wireless and wireline) components oftotal telecommunications credit-related assets represented 86% of the totaltelecommunications portfolio, with 69% considered investment grade, whileemerging telecommunications represented the balance.FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: Loans to financial institutions decreased $2.5 billionduring 2001, when compared with year-end, primarily as a result of reductions inthe foreign portion of the portfolio. Nonperforming financial institution loansincreased to $257 million from $42 million at December 31, 2000, primarilybecause of one borrower in the domestic portion of that portfolio. -36-  37Part IItem 2 (continued)DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts used byJPMorgan Chase, see Note 3 of this Form 10-Q, and page 50 and Notes 1 and 25 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at June 30,2001 and December 31, 2000.COUNTRY EXPOSUREThe following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries.This disclosure is based on management's view of country exposure. Thedifference between the current presentation and that used at the two priorquarter-ends is primarily as follows: (1) collateral held is used to reduceexposure on counterparty trades within a country; and (2) disclosure is based ontotal exposure, which includes local exposure funded locally in addition tocross-border exposure. Management believes the current presentation moreaccurately reflects JPMorgan Chase's country exposure. Amounts as of December31, 2000 have been restated to conform to the current presentation.(a) Lending includes loans and accrued interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit, and undrawn commitments to extend credit.(b) Trading includes (1) issuer exposure on cross-border debt and equity instruments, held in both trading and investment accounts, adjusted for the impact of issuer hedges including credit derivatives; and (2) counterparty exposure on derivative and foreign exchange contracts as well as security financing trades (resale agreements and securities borrowed). The amounts associated with derivative and foreign exchange contracts are presented after taking into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.(c) Mainly local exposure funded cross border.(d) Local exposure is defined as exposure to a country denominated in local currency, booked and funded locally.(e) Total exposure includes exposure to both government and private sector entities in a country.================================================================================ -37-  38Part IItem 2 (continued)CONSUMER PORTFOLIO- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Represents the portion of JPMorgan Chase's credit card receivables that have been securitized.(b) Consists of installment loans (direct and indirect types of consumer finance), student loans, unsecured lines of credit and foreign consumer.(c) Annualized.================================================================================RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS: Residential mortgage loans were $56.7 billion atJune 30, 2001, a $6.4 billion increase from year-end. During the first sixmonths of 2001, the level of nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased2%. The net charge-off rate of 0.05% for the second quarter of 2001 was fourbasis points lower than for the second quarter 2000.CREDIT CARD LOANS: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a"managed basis," which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet aswell as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed credit card receivables of $37.3 billion as of June 30, 2001 increased3% when compared with year-end 2000 and increased over 16% from June 30 lastyear. During the 2001 second quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of averagecredit card receivables increased to 5.54%, compared with 5.16% in theprior-year period. Loans over 90 days past due decreased to 1.88% of theportfolio at June 30, 2001, compared with 1.96% at December 31, 2000. Managementanticipates that the managed credit card net charge-off ratio for full-year 2001will be higher than for full-year 2000. -38-  39Part IItem 2 (continued)AUTO FINANCINGS: Auto financings outstanding increased 18% at June 30, 2001,when compared with year-end 2000. The charge-off rate of 0.46% for the 2001second quarter, unchanged from full-year 2000, continues to be indicative ofthis portfolio's selective approach to asset origination. Total originationswere $9.1 billion for the six months of 2001, compared with $5.1 billion for thesame 2000 period.OTHER CONSUMER LOANS: The level of other consumer loans of $7.5 billion at June30, 2001 decreased 6% from year-end 2000. The net charge-off rates related tothis portfolio were higher in the second quarter, when compared with the secondquarter of 2000 due to higher bankruptcy losses for certain installment loansand revolving lines of credit.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESLoans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of June 30, 2001, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.Within the allowance, there are both specific and expected loss components and aresidual component. For a further discussion of the specific loss, expected lossand residual components of the allowance for loan losses, see page 53 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.The provision for loan losses for the second quarter of 2001 increased $197million or 60%, when compared with the second quarter of 2000.Foreign commercial loan net charge-offs increased $21 million during the firstsix months of 2001, when compared with the first six months of 2000, whileforeign commercial nonperforming loans decreased $536 million from June 30, 2000to $362 million at June 30, 2001. However, domestic commercial loan netcharge-offs and nonperforming loans increased $181 million and $935 million,respectively, during the same periods.Lending-Related Commitments: JPMorgan Chase also has an allowance for itslending-related commitments, using a methodology similar to that used for theloan portfolio. This allowance, which is reported in Other Liabilities, was $285million at June 30, 2001, $283 million at December 31, 2000 and $333 million atJune 30, 2000. -39-  40Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------AGGREGATE VAR EXPOSUREValue-at-Risk ("VAR") is a measure of the dollar amount of potential loss fromadverse market moves in an everyday market environment. VAR calculations areperformed for all material trading and investment portfolios and for marketrisk-related A/L activities. Due to procedural differences at the heritagefirms, combined VAR is not available for periods prior to the merger date.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thetables that follow provide an overview of the market risk exposure of JPMorganChase at the dates indicated. The following table represents JPMorgan Chase'saverage and period-end VARs for its trading portfolios and its A/L activities.================================================================================(a) Substantially all of the risk is interest rate related.NM - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect. JPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs are less than the sum of the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.================================================================================MARKET RISK-RELATED ACTIVITIESValue-at-Risk: JPMorgan Chase is exposed to interest rate-, foreign exchange-,equity- and commodity-market risks in its trading portfolio. The table belowreflects VAR data for the trading portfolio by risk category. See the AggregateVAR Exposure section above for average and period-end VARs for the total tradingportfolio.================================================================================(a) While integrated VAR computations are available for the aggregate portfolio, integrated VAR by risk category has not yet been implemented. Accordingly, this table has been prepared using certain estimates and assumptions. Each risk category VAR was computed based on the methodologies used by the heritage firms, assuming no correlation between the heritage firms' exposures. Actual risk category VAR may differ from these estimates.NM - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect. JPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs are less than the sum of the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.================================================================================ -40-  41Part IItem 2 (continued)HISTOGRAM:The following histogram illustrates JPMorgan Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of the marked-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income, brokeragecommissions, underwriting fees or other revenue.In the first half of 2001, JPMorgan Chase posted positive daily marketrisk-related revenue for 112 out of 126 business days, with 91 days exceedingpositive $20 million. Losses were sustained on 14 of the 126 days represented inthe histogram. JPMorgan Chase incurred four daily trading losses in excess of$20 million in the first half of 2001.Due to significant differences in the definition of market risk-related revenuesused in the preparation of histograms at Chase and J.P. Morgan, it is notfeasible to include a histogram for fiscal-year 2000. [ SEE APPENDIX 1 -- NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF GRAPHIC IMAGE MATERIAL]Stress Testing: Whereas VAR captures exposure to unlikely events in normalmarkets, stress testing discloses market risk under plausible events in abnormalmarkets. -41-  42Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table represents the potential stress test loss (pre-tax) inJPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase's stress testscenarios.INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSET/LIABILITY ACTIVITIESJPMorgan Chase also is exposed to market risk in its investment portfolio andA/L activities. Market risk measurements for JPMorgan Chase's investmentportfolio and A/L activities reflect all significant market risk-related factorsthat have an effect on these activities. Non-market factors that are notincluded in market risk measurements, such as changes in credit quality, alsomay have an affect on these activities.Value-at-Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section on page 40 for JPMorganChase's average and period-end VARs for its investment portfolio and marketrisk-related A/L activities.Stress Testing:Economic value stress testing measures the potential change in the market valueof JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities. As of June 30,2001, the largest potential loss under the various economic value stress testscenarios utilized by the Firm on the value of JPMorgan Chase's investmentportfolio and A/L activities would have been equivalent to less than 1% ofJPMorgan Chase's market capitalization.The NII stress test measures the potential change in JPMorgan Chase's interestearnings over a one-year time horizon. At June 30, 2001, JPMorgan Chase'slargest potential NII stress test loss was estimated to be approximately 3.8% ofprojected net income for the full-year 2001.Nonstatistical Risk Measures: Exposure to interest rate risk is assessed using aBasis Point Value ("BPV") method. BPV measures the change in market value ofJPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities to a one basis pointincrease in interest rates (directional risk) or one basis point widening ofinterest rate spreads (basis risk). The table that follows shows that JPMorganChase had a directional BPV of $(6.5) million (pre-tax) at June 30, 2001. Thisindicates that the market value of JPMorgan Chase's A/L positions would havedeclined by approximately $6.5 million for every one basis point increase ininterest rates along the interest rate yield curve. The table also shows thatthe economic value of JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activitieswould have declined by $(14.6) million (pre-tax) for every one basis pointwidening of interest rate spreads (basis risk). -42-  43Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAPITAL MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December 31, 2000 and should be read inconjunction with pages 44-45 and Note 23 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.CAPITALJPMorgan Chase's capital levels at June 30, 2001 continued to improve withratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. At June 30, 2001, the Tier 1 andTotal Capital ratios were 8.7% and 12.2%, respectively.The following table shows JPMorgan Chase's capital generation and use during theperiods indicated.In the first quarter of 2001, JPMorgan Chase raised the quarterly cash dividendon its common stock to $0.34 per share from $0.32 per share. The Firm's currentdividend policy is to pay over time common stock dividends equal toapproximately 25% to 35% of operating earnings less preferred stock dividends,although in any given quarter the common stock dividend may be higher or lowerthan this range. The current quarterly dividend exceeds the target range giventhis quarter's lower operating earnings. Future dividend policies will bedetermined by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors after taking intoconsideration the Firm's earnings, financial condition and applicablegovernmental regulations and policies.At June 30, 2001, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (the sum of Tier 1and Tier 2 Capital) was $55.0 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from December31, 2000. This increase reflects retained earnings (net income less common andpreferred dividends) generated during the period, aggregate common stockissuances and treasury stock reissuances of $1.0 billion and the issuance of anaggregate $2.5 billion in trust preferred capital securities and subordinateddebt. These sources of capital were partially offset by the redemption ofpreferred stock and subordinated debt and by capital needed for internal assetgrowth.The Board of Directors of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has authorized, effective July19, 2001, the repurchase of up to $6 billion of JPMorgan Chase's common stock.This authorization is in addition to any amounts necessary to provide forissuances under JPMorgan Chase's dividend reinvestment plan and its variousstock-based director and employee benefits plans.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk management focusesprimarily on the developments since December 31, 2000 and should be read inconjunction with page 59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report. -43-  44Part IItem 2 (continued)LIQUIDITYDuring the first six months of 2001, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $6.8billion of long-term debt and $500 million of trust preferred capitalsecurities. During the same period, $9.2 billion of long-term debt matured orwas redeemed and $0.5 billion of preferred stock was called.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer to page58 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Form 10-K.DIVIDENDSJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries, without the approval of their relevantbanking regulators, could pay dividends to their respective bank holdingcompanies in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These dividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaledapproximately $3.8 billion at June 30, 2001.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LEGAL ISOLATIONIn July 2001, the FASB issued a Technical Bulletin that would delay theeffective date of SFAS 140 for certain provisions that impact entities subjectto possible receivership by the FDIC. For those entities, the Technical Bulletindelays the isolation standards of SFAS 140 until at least December 31, 2001. TheFirm currently is reviewing its transactions to determine what modificationswill be required to conform with SFAS 140 and the Technical Bulletin.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSIn June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 141, which revises the financial accountingand reporting for business combinations, and also issued SFAS 142, which revisesthe financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets.SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using thepurchase method. Accounting for business combinations using the pooling ofinterests method no longer is allowed. SFAS 141 also requires that intangibleassets acquired in a business combination be recognized apart from goodwill ifthe intangible assets meet one of two criteria -- the contractual-legalcriterion or the separability criterion. The provisions of SFAS 141 apply to allbusiness combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as businesscombinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date ofacquisition is July 1, 2001 or later. Certain transition provisions could affectthe accounting for business combinations using the purchase method that werecompleted before July 1, 2001.SFAS 142 establishes how intangible assets (other than those acquired in abusiness combination) should be accounted for upon acquisition. It alsoaddresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted forsubsequent to their acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets that haveindefinite useful lives no longer will be amortized but will be tested at leastannually for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives will continue to beamortized over their useful lives. The provisions of SFAS 142 are required to beadopted by the Firm beginning January 1, 2002. Impairment losses that arise dueto the initial application of SFAS 142 are required to be reported as a changein accounting principle.The Firm currently is assessing the impact of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 on itsfinancial condition and operating performance. -44-  45Part IItem 2 (continued) J.P.
