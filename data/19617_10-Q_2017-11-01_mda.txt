>Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisThe following table presents the assets and liabilities reported on a nonrecurring basis at fair value as of&#32;September 30, 2017 and 2016, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been recognized for the&#32;three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, related to financial instruments held at those dates.&#32;For further information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see&#32;Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.99Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair valueThe following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values at&#32;September 30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note&#32;3 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The majority of&#32;the Firm's lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.&#32;The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases,&#32;the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, see page 151&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.100Note 3&#32;&#8211; Fair value optionFor a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note&#32;4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following&#32;tables present the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the&#32;three and nine months ended&#32;September 30, 2017&#32;and 2016, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.&#32;101102Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of&#32;September 30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.&#32;At&#32;September 30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was&#32;$4.5 billion&#32;and $4.6 billion, with a corresponding fair value of&#32;$(90) million&#32;and $(118) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note&#32;29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report, and Note 19&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe following table presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.103Note 4&#32;&#8211; Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of&#32;the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note&#32;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The Firm's disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of&#32;the Firm's derivatives are designated in hedge &#160;accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in&#32;the Firm's market-making businesses or for other purposes.&#32;The following table outlines&#32;the Firm's primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.&#32;104Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of&#32;the Firm's derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in&#32;the Firm's view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.&#32;105Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated balance sheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on&#32;the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.&#32;106Derivatives netting&#32;The following tables present, as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where&#32;the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.&#32;In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables,&#32;the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with&#32;the Firm's derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:&#32;107108Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features&#32;For a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to&#32;the Firm's derivative contracts, see Note&#32;6 of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral&#32;the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.&#160;The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of&#32;JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), at September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.&#32;Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset&#32;In certain instances&#32;the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer.&#160;The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note&#32;10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. There were no such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and such transfers at&#32;December&#160;31, 2016&#32;were not material.&#32;109Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of incomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.&#32;Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the&#32;three and nine&#32;months ended&#32;September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.&#32;The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income.&#32;110Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the&#32;three and nine&#32;months ended&#32;September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.&#32;The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income.&#32;The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the&#32;three and nine months ended&#32;September 30, 2017 and 2016.Over the next 12 months,&#32;the Firm expects that approximately&#32;$58 million&#32;(after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately&#32;6 years. &#160;For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately&#32;2 years. The Firm's longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.&#32;111Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following&#32;table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the&#32;three and nine&#32;months ended&#32;September 30, 2017 and 2016.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&#160;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note&#32;5&#32;for information on principal transactions revenue.&#32;112Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note&#32;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in&#32;the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.&#32;Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, where&#32;JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where&#32;JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.&#32;113Note 5&#32;&#8211; Noninterest revenue and noninterest expenseNoninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for&#32;the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note&#32;7 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report. Investment banking feesThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees.&#32;Principal transactionsThe following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of&#32;the Firm's client-driven market-making activities.&#160;See Note&#32;6&#32;for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.&#32;The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.&#32;Lending- and deposit-related feesThe following table presents the components of lending- and deposit-related fees. &#32;&#160;Asset management, administration and commissionsThe following table presents the components of&#32;Firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.&#32;Other incomeOther income on&#32;the Firm's Consolidated statements of income included the following:&#32;Other income also included a legal benefit of&#32;$645 million&#32;recorded in Corporate in the second quarter of 2017 related to a settlement with the FDIC receivership for Washington Mutual and with Deutsche Bank as trustee to certain Washington Mutual trusts.Noninterest expenseOther expenseOther expense on&#32;the Firm's Consolidated statements of income included the following:&#32;114Note 6&#32;&#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note&#32;8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of&#32;interest income and interest expense.115Note 7&#32;&#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's pension and OPEB plans, see Note&#32;9 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The following table presents the fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans:&#32;There are no expected contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan for 2017.&#32;116Note 8&#32;&#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note&#32;10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The Firm&#32;recognized the following&#32;noncash compensation expense related to&#32;its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income.In the first quarter of 2017, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2016 performance year,&#32;the Firm granted&#32;23 million&#32;RSUs and&#32;675 thousand&#32;PSUs,&#32;all with a weighted-average grant date fair value of&#32;$84.25.117Note 9 &#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as trading, AFS or HTM. Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note&#32;2. Predominantly all of&#32;the Firm's AFS and HTM securities are held&#32;by Treasury and CIO within the investment securities portfolio in connection with&#32;the Firm's asset-liability management objectives. At&#32;September 30, 2017, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities &#160;with an average credit rating of&#32;AA+&#32;(based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note&#32;12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.&#32;118Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at September 30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.119Gross unrealized losses The Firm has recognized unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell as&#32;OTTI. The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of September 30, 2017, and it is not likely that&#32;the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income,&#32;the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of September 30, 2017, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.&#32;For additional information on other-than-temporary impairment, see Note 12 of the JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and OTTI losses from AFS securities that were recognized in income.&#32;&#160;Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities The cumulative credit loss component, including any changes therein, of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that&#32;the Firm does not intend to sell was not material as of and during the&#32;three and nine&#32;month periods ended September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016.120Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.&#32;121Note 10 &#8211; Securities financing activities For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.&#32;For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected,&#32;see Note 3. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements,&#32;see Note 20.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of&#32;the Firm's securities financing agreements as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and December 31, 2016. When&#32;the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,&#32;the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition,&#32;the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces, in&#32;the Firm's view, the economic exposure with&#32;the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as &#8220;Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,&#8221; and reduces the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; presented below, if&#32;the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.&#32;122The tables below present as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December 31, 2016 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm held $4.1 billion&#32;and $5.9 billion&#32;respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated balance sheets.123Note 11 &#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition.&#32;The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&#160;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. See Note&#32;3&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on&#32;the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note&#32;2&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by&#32;the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment&#32;the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.The following tables summarize&#32;the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.&#32;124The following&#32;table provides information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated.&#32;This table excludes loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that&#32;the Firm reduces its credit exposures.&#32;The following table provides information about gains and losses on loan sales, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, by portfolio segment.&#32;Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, consumer and business banking loans, and student loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.&#32;The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. In the first&#32;quarter of 2017,&#32;the Firm transferred the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale. For additional information see&#32;Note 23.&#160;For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. 125Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.&#32;126The following table represents&#32;the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.&#160;HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period.&#32;That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those&#32;products is higher than the minimum payment options&#32;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into&#32;the Firm's allowance for loan losses.&#32;Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a&#32;TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.127The following&#32;tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by&#32;the Firm.Loan modificationsModifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.&#160;The following table presents new TDRs reported by&#32;the Firm.128Nature and extent of modificationsThe U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable programs, as well as&#32;the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following&#32;tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under&#32;the Firm's&#32;loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented.&#32;These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.&#32;129Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following&#32;tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under&#32;the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following&#32;tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications.&#32;These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.&#32;At&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 10 years&#32;for home equity and 14 years&#32;for residential mortgage.&#32;The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).&#160;Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of&#32;$836 million&#32;and $932 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.130Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto and business banking loans.&#32;This table excludes student loans as a result of the transfer of the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale&#32;in the first quarter of 2017 and its subsequent sale&#32;in the second quarter of 2017. 131Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.&#160;Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.&#160;See Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.The following table provides information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material for the&#32;three and nine months ended&#32;September 30, 2017&#32;and 2016.132Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.133Approximately&#32;25%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs.&#32;The following table sets forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for&#32;the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the&#32;three and nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016, and represents&#32;the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of&#32;$1.4 billion&#32;and $1.7 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.&#160;Credit card loan portfolioFor further information on the credit card loan portfolio, including credit quality indicators, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's credit card loans.134Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&#32;At September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, $87 million&#32;and $94 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $39 million&#32;and $48 million&#32;at September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.&#32;Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for&#32;60&#32;months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were&#32;$191 million&#32;and $162 million&#32;for the&#32;three months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016, respectively, and $552 million&#32;and $462 million&#32;for the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.&#160;Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.&#32;For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become&#32;two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with&#32;the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be&#32;31.23%&#32;and 28.87%&#32;as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively.&#32;135Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &#160;assigned to each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note&#32;14 and Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.&#32;Effective in the first quarter of 2017,&#32;the Firm revised its methodology for the assignment of industry classifications, to better monitor and manage concentrations. This largely resulted in the re-assignment of holding companies from Other to the industry of risk category based on the primary business activity of the holding company's underlying entities. In the tables below, the prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.&#32;136The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Wholesale impaired loans and loan modifications Wholesale impaired loans consist of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents&#32;the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.&#160;Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the&#32;tables above. TDRs were $699 million&#32;and $733 million&#32;as of September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively.137Note 12 &#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. During the second quarter of 2017, the Firm refined its loss estimates relating to the wholesale portfolio by incorporating the use of internal historical data versus external credit rating agency default statistics to estimate&#32;PD. In addition, an adjustment to the modeled loss estimates for wholesale lending-related commitments was incorporated similar to the adjustment applied for wholesale loans. The impacts of these refinements were not material to the allowance for credit losses.&#32;Allowance for credit losses and related informationThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.&#32;Note: In the first quarter of 2017, the Firm transferred the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale. For additional information see Note 23.138Note 13 &#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs, see Note 1 of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on&#32;page 141&#32;of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored VIEsCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts, including its primary vehicle, the Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 142&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&#160;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans&#32;(including student loans) primarily in its&#32;CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved,&#32;the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of&#32;the Firm's involvement with&#32;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.139The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in&#32;Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by&#32;the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests, recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative transactions. In certain instances,&#32;the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on&#32;page 142&#32;of this Note for further information regarding&#32;the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and&#32;page 143&#32;of this Note for information on&#32;the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies.140Residential mortgageThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by&#32;CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either&#32;CCB or CIB. For a more detailed description of&#32;the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report. See the table on&#32;page 142&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB&#32;originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of&#32;the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report. See the table on&#32;page 142&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's participation in certain re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The following table represents the transfers of securities to re-securitization VIEs.The following table represents information on nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.As of September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm did not consolidate any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitizations and agency re-securitizations.&#160;Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with&#32;Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.In the normal course of business,&#32;JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.&#32;The Firm held&#32;$21.8 billion&#32;and $21.2 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016&#32;respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation.&#32;The Firm's investments reflect&#32;the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.&#32;Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,&#32;the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were&#32;$7.3 billion&#32;and $7.4 billion&#32;at September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note&#32;19.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's investor intermediation activities, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The Firm's maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to nonconsolidated&#32;Firm-sponsored municipal bond VIEs at&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and December&#160;31, 2016, was zero&#32;and $662 million, respectively.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,&#32;remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where&#32;the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,&#32;the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.141Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by&#32;the Firm as of September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans.&#32;For a&#32;further description of&#32;the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.142Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to&#32;the Firm's securitization activities for the&#32;three and nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by&#32;the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,&#32;the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises&#32;(&#8220;U.S. GSEs&#8221;). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans).&#32;The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.&#32;The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales,&#32;the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser.&#32;See Note 19&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report&#32;for additional information about&#32;the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note&#32;14&#32;for additional information about the impact of&#32;the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.&#160;143Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to&#32;the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note&#32;19, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When&#32;the Firm's&#32;repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 11 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.&#160;The following table presents loans&#32;the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on&#32;the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets as of September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and December&#160;31, 2016. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.&#32;Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in&#32;Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.144Note&#32;14 &#8211; Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rightsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.GoodwillThe following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.&#160;Goodwill Impairment testingFor further description of the Firm's goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 240&#8211;241 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at September&#160;30, 2017, or December&#160;31, 2016, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;or 2016.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, estimates of adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of&#32;the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.145Mortgage servicing rightsMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report&#32;and Note&#32;2&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the&#32;three and nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016.146The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and nine months ended&#32;September 30, 2017&#32;and 2016.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of&#32;the Firm's MSRs at&#32;September 30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&#160;Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which could either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.147Note 15 &#8211; DepositsFor further discussion on deposits, see Note&#32;19 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.At&#32;September&#160;30, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.&#160;Note 16 &#8211; Earnings per shareFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), see Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2017&#32;and 2016.148Note 17 &#8211; Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to&#32;the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.149The following table presents the pre-tax and after-tax changes in the components of OCI.150<hr
