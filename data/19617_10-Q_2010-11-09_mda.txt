Table of ContentsProvision for credit lossesThe provision for credit losses was $3.2&nbsp;billion for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010,down by $6.6&nbsp;billion or 67% from the prior-year provision. The total consumer provision for creditlosses was $3.2&nbsp;billion, compared with $9.0&nbsp;billion in the prior year, reflecting a reduction inthe allowance for credit losses as a result of improved delinquency trends and reduced netcharge-offs. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $44&nbsp;million, compared with $779&nbsp;million,reflecting a reduction in the allowance for credit losses predominantly as a result of continuedimprovement in the credit quality of the commercial and industrial portfolio, reduced netcharge-offs and repayments.98 Table of ContentsMARKET RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of the Firm's market risk management organization, major market risk driversand classification of risks, see pages 118&#151;124 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Value-at-riskJPMorgan Chase's primary statistical risk measure, value-at-risk (&#147;VaR&#148;), estimates the potentialloss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment and provides a consistentcross-business measure of risk profiles and levels of diversification. VaR is used for comparingrisks across businesses, for monitoring limits and as an input to economic-capital calculations.Each business day, as part of its risk management activities, the Firm undertakes a comprehensiveVaR calculation that includes the majority of its market risks. These VaR results are reported tosenior management.To calculate VaR, the Firm uses historical simulation, based on a one-day time horizon and anexpected tail-loss methodology, which measures risk across instruments and portfolios in aconsistent and comparable way. The simulation is based on data for the previous 12&nbsp;months. Thisapproach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of future changes;this assumption may not always be accurate, particularly when there is volatility in the marketenvironment. For certain products, such as syndicated lending facilities and some mortgage-relatedsecurities for which price-based time series are not readily available, market-based data are usedin conjunction with sensitivity factors to estimate the risk. It is likely that using an actualprice-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented.In addition, certain risk parameters, such as correlation risk among certain instruments, are notfully captured in VaR.The following section describes JPMorgan Chase's VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.95% confidence level VaRTotal IB trading VaR by risk type, credit portfolio VaR and other VaR99 Table of ContentsVaR MeasurementThe Firm's IB trading and other VaR measure above includes substantially all trading activities inIB, as well as syndicated lending facilities that the Firm intends to distribute. Credit portfolioVaR includes VaR on derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA, and MTM hedges of the retained loanportfolio, all of which are reported in principal transactions revenue. Credit portfolio VaR doesnot include the retained loan portfolio, which is not MTM. In addition, IB and other VaR measureinclude certain positions used as part of the Firm's risk management function within the CIO and inthe Mortgage Banking businesses. The CIO VaR measure includes positions, primarily in debtsecurities and credit products, used to manage the Firm's risk concentrations, including interestrate and credit risks arising from the Firm's ongoing business activities. The Mortgage Banking VaRmeasure includes the Firm's mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs and all related hedges.The VaR measure excludes the DVA taken on certain structured liabilities and derivatives to reflectthe credit quality of the Firm. It also excludes certain activities such as Private Equity andprincipal investing (e.g., mezzanine financing, tax-oriented investments, etc.), as well asstructural interest rate risk-management positions, capital management positions, and longer-terminvestments managed by the CIO. These longer-term positions are managed through the Firm's earningsat risk and other cash flow&#151;monitoring processes rather than by using a VaR measure. Principalinvesting activities and Private Equity positions are managed using stress and scenario analyses.2010 and 2009 third-quarter and year-to-date VaR resultsAs presented in the table on the previous page, average IB and other VaR totaled $109&nbsp;million and$99&nbsp;million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010, compared with$178&nbsp;million and $226&nbsp;million for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009. The decreasein average VaR for the three and nine month periods in 2010 was driven by a decline in the impactof market volatility in early 2009, as well as a reduction in exposures primarily driven by the CIOand IB. Average total IB trading and credit portfolio VaR for the third quarter of 2010 was $99million, compared with $143&nbsp;million for the same prior-year period. The decrease in IB trading VaRfor both periods in 2010 was driven by a decline in market volatility, as well as areduction in exposure, primarily in the fixed income risk component. The CIO VaR averaged $53million for the third quarter of 2010, compared with $99&nbsp;million for the same prior-year period.Mortgage Banking VaR averaged $24&nbsp;million for the current quarter, compared with $49&nbsp;million forthe same prior-year period. Decreases for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 wereagain driven by a decline in market volatility.TheFirm's average IB and other VaR diversification benefit was $52&nbsp;million for the three months endedSeptember&nbsp;30, 2010, compared with $82&nbsp;million in the prior-year period and remained unchanged at32% of the sum. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010, the Firm's average diversificationbenefit was $66&nbsp;million or 40% of the sum, compared with $87&nbsp;million or 28% of the sum in theprior-year period. The Firm experienced a gain in diversification benefit as the markets started torecover and positions changed such that correlations decreased. In general, over the course of theyear, VaR exposures can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates anddiversification benefits change.VaR back-testingTo evaluate the soundness of its VaR model the Firm conducts daily back-testing of VaR against theFirm's market risk&#151;related revenue, which is defined as: the change in value of principaltransactions revenue for IB and the CIO; trading-related net interest income for IB, the CIO andMortgage Banking; IB brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue; revenue fromsyndicated lending facilities that the Firm intends to distribute; and mortgage fees and relatedincome for the Firm's mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs, and all related hedges. Thedaily firmwide market risk&#151;related revenue excludes gains and losses from DVA and from longer-termcorporate investments and Private Equity losses.The following histogram illustrates the daily market risk&#151;related gains and losses for IB, the CIOand Mortgage Banking positions for the first nine months of 2010. The chart shows that the Firmposted market risk&#151;related gains on 187 out of 195&nbsp;days in this period, with 12&nbsp;days exceeding$200&nbsp;million. The inset graph looks at those days on which the Firm experienced losses and depictsthe amount by which the 95% confidence-level VaR exceeded the actual loss on each of those days.During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010, losses were sustained on eight days, all withinthe second quarter of 2010, none of which exceeded the VaR measure.100 Table of ContentsThe following table provides information about the gross sensitivity of DVA to a one-basis-pointincrease in JPMorgan Chase's credit spreads. This sensitivity represents the impact from aone-basis-point parallel shift in JPMorgan Chase's entire credit curve. As credit curves do nottypically move in a parallel fashion, the sensitivity multiplied by the change in spreads at asingle maturity point may not be representative of the actual revenue recognized.Debit valuation adjustment sensitivityEconomic-value stress testingWhile VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in normal markets, stress testingcaptures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. The Firmconducts economic-value stress tests using multiple scenarios that assume credit spreads widensignificantly, equity prices decline and interest rates across the major currencies changesignificantly. Other scenarios focus on the risks predominant in individual business segments andinclude scenarios that focus on the potential for adverse movements in complex portfolios.Scenarios were updated more frequently in 2009 and, in some cases, redefined to reflect thesignificant market volatility which began in late 2008. Along with VaR, stress testing is importantin measuring and controlling risk; it enhances understanding of the Firm's risk profile and losspotential, as stress losses are monitored against limits. Stress testing is also employed inone-off approvals and cross-business risk measurement, as well as an input to economic capitalallocation. Stress-test results, trends and explanations based on current market risk positions arereported to the Firm's senior management and to the lines of business to help them better measureand manage risks and to understand event risk-sensitive positions.101 Table of ContentsEarnings-at-risk stress testingThe VaR and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest-rateexposure on net income for the Firm's core nontrading business activities is also important. Forfurther discussion on the effect of interest rate exposure, see page 123 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report.The Firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activitiesunder a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change inthe Firm's net interest income, and the corresponding impact to the Firm's pretax earnings, overthe following 12&nbsp;months. These tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors, such asthe rates themselves (e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits, optionalityand changes in product mix. The tests include forecasted balance-sheet changes, such as asset salesand securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior.Immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk, and so a number of alternativescenarios are also reviewed. These scenarios include the implied forward curve, nonparallel rateshifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates. These scenarios are intended toprovide a comprehensive view of JPMorgan Chase's earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes.JPMorgan Chase's 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profiles as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009, were as follows.The change in earnings at risk from December&nbsp;31, 2009, resulted from investment portfoliorepositioning, assumed higher levels of deposit balances and reduced levels of fixed-rate loans.The Firm's risk to rising rates was largely the result of widening deposit margins, which arecurrently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates.Additionally, under another interest rate scenario used by the Firm &#150; involving a steeper yieldcurve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at currentlevels &#150; results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $852&nbsp;million. The increase inearnings under this scenario is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higherlong-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of Private Equity Risk Management, see page 124 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report. At September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the carrying value of the PrivateEquity portfolio was $9.4&nbsp;billion and $7.3&nbsp;billion, respectively, of which $1.2&nbsp;billion and $762million, respectively, represented securities with publicly available market quotations.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's Operational Risk Management, see page 125 of JPMorganChase's 2009 Annual Report.REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of the Firm's Reputation and Fiduciary Risk Management, see page 126 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision and Regulationsection on pages 1&#150;4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Form 10-K. On July&nbsp;21, 2010, President Obamasigned into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-FrankAct&#148;) which will make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. Foradditional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act, please see Part&nbsp;II Other Information,Item&nbsp;1A Risk Factors on pages 200&#150;201 of this Form 10-Q.DividendsAt September&nbsp;30, 2010, JPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, $8.3&nbsp;billionin dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of theirrelevant banking regulators.102 Table of ContentsOTHER MATTERSCarlson Wagonlit Travel Related-Party TransactionIn connection with the continued expansion of Card Services' product offerings, the Firmplans to transfer to CS, in the 2011 first quarter, the commercial card business currently includedin TSS. Also, in connection with such expansion, One EquityPartners' (&#147;OEP&#148;) noncontrolling investment in CarlsonWagonlit, B.V., a company engaged in the travel services business (the&#147;portfolio investment&#148;), will be transferredfrom OEP to Card Services in the 2010 fourth quarter. Certain Executive Officers and otheremployees of the Firm have an interest in the portfolio company by reason of theirparticipation in a co-invest plan (the &#147;employees' co-invest plan&#148;) that invests alongside theprivate equity investments made by OEP and, in the case of the OEP investment professionals,because of their carried interests in OEP's investment vehicles as well as their participation inanother co-invest plan (the &#147;professionals' co-invest plan&#148;) that also invests alongside theprivate equity investments made by OEP. It is anticipated that participants in the employees' andprofessionals' co-invest plans will receive cash distributions as a result of OEP's relinquishmentof its ownership interest in the portfolio investment, and that OEP investment professionals willhave amounts allocated to their capital accounts in respect of their carried interests. Thosedistributions and allocated amounts are based on a valuation of the portfolio investment that ishigher than the valuation of the portfolio investment recorded on the Firm's balance sheet atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2010. That is because, while the Firm's balance sheet valuation does not reflectinternal estimates of synergies that Card Services expects to derive in the future by integratingthe portfolio investment into the Firm's commercial card business within CS, the valuation uponwhich the distributions and allocations are being made does reflect the internal estimates of suchsynergies, consistent with the methodology that would generally be employed by a third-partypurchaser in such a situation.Becausethe $24.2&nbsp;million cash distribution to be made to the employees' co-invest plan will includean aggregate amount of approximately $2.5&nbsp;million to be paid tocertain of the Firm's ExecutiveOfficers, approval of the transfer of the portfolio investment from OEP to Card Services waseffected pursuant to the Firm's &#147;Related Party Transactions Policy.&#148; That policy applies to anyFirm transaction in which a director, executive officer, 5% shareholder or immediate family memberthereof has a direct or indirect material interest and the aggregate amount involved will or may beexpected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year. Accordingly, the terms of the transfer (includingall of the cash distributions and allocations described above) were first reviewed by the Firm'sCEO, CFO, General Counsel, and the CEO of Card Services, none of whom participate in eitherco-invest plan or receive carried interest, and each of whom recommended approval of the transferby the Audit Committee of the Firm's Board of Directors. The Audit Committee also received avaluation letter from the Firm's IB, indicating the reasonableness of the valuation of theportfolio company on which the distributions were determined. The Audit Committee has approved thetransfer.103 Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRMJPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding itsreported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment toascertain the value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies andcontrol procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as partof such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from periodto period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process forchanging methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates fordetermining the value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a briefdescription of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant valuation judgments.Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase's allowance for credit losses covers the retained wholesale and consumer loanportfolios, as well as the Firm's portfolio of lending-related commitments. The allowance for loanlosses is intended to adjust the value of the Firm's loan assets to reflect probable credit lossesas of the balance sheet date. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishingthe Firm's allowance for credit losses, see Note 14 on pages 196&#150;198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report. The methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance forlending-related commitments involves significant judgment. For a further description of thesejudgments, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127&#150;128 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report;for amounts recorded as of September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages95&#150;98 and Note 14 on pages 154&#150;155 of this Form 10-Q.As noted on page 127 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report, many factors can affect estimates ofloss, including volatility of loss given default, probability of default and rating migrations. TheFirm uses a risk-rating system to determine the credit quality of its wholesale loans. The Firm'swholesale allowance is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to a loan. As of September&nbsp;30, 2010,assuming a one-notch downgrade in the Firm's internal risk ratings for its entire wholesaleportfolio, the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale portfolio would increase byapproximately $1.2&nbsp;billion. This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and intended to provide anindication of the impact of risk ratings on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses forwholesale loans. In the Firm's view, the likelihood of a one-notchdowngrade for all wholesale loans within a short timeframe is remote, and it is not intended toimply management's expectation of future deterioration in risk ratings. Given the process the Firmfollows in determining the risk ratings of its loans, management believes the risk ratingscurrently assigned to wholesale loans are appropriate.The allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio is sensitive to changes in the economicenvironment, delinquency status, the realizable value of collateral, FICO scores, borrower behaviorand other risk factors. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio across the entire consumercredit product spectrum appears to have stabilized but remains under stress, as high unemploymentand weak overall economic conditions continue to result in a high level of delinquencies, whilecontinued weak housing prices continue to result in elevated loss severities. Significant judgmentis required to estimate the ultimate duration and severity of the current economic downturn, aswell as its impact on housing prices and the labor market. While the allowance for credit losses ishighly sensitive to both home prices and unemployment rates, in the current market it is difficultto estimate how potential changes in one or both of these factors might impact the allowance forcredit losses. For example, while both factors are important determinants of overall allowancelevels, changes in one factor or the other may not occur at the same rate, or improvement in onefactor may offset deterioration in the other. In addition, changes in these factors would notnecessarily be consistent across geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predictthe extent to which changes in both or either of these factors would ultimately impact thefrequency or severity of losses, and overall loss rates are a function of both the frequency andseverity of individual loan losses.Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventoryJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of suchassets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets andliabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including loans accounted for atthe lower of cost or fair value that are only subject to fair value adjustments under certaincircumstances.104 Table of ContentsAssets measured at fair valueThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of suchassets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.ValuationFor instruments classified within level 3 of the hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair valuemay be significant. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack ofobservability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in derivingvaluation inputs &#150; including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. In addition to market information,models also incorporate transaction details, such as maturity. Finally, management judgment must beapplied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty creditquality, the Firm's creditworthiness, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters, whererelevant. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specificcontractual terms, as well as the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as awhole. For further discussion of changes in level 3 assets, see Note 3 on pages 114&#150;128 of thisForm 10-Q.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of revenue or lossrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods areappropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of differentmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments couldresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion ofthe determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 148&#150;152of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. In addition, for a further discussion of the significantjudgments and estimates involved in the determination of the Firm's mortgage-related exposures, see&#147;Mortgage-related exposures carried at fair value&#148; in Note 3 on pages 161&#150;162 of JPMorgan Chase's2009 Annual Report.Purchased credit-impaired loansIn connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans withevidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and for which it was probable, atacquisition, that the Firm would be unable to collect all contractually required paymentsreceivable. These PCI loans are accounted for on a pool basis, and the pools are considered to beperforming. At the time of the acquisition, these loans were recorded at fair value, including anestimate of losses that were expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the loanpools. Many of the 105 Table of Contentsassumptions and estimates underlying the estimation of the initial fair valueand the ongoing updates to management's expectation of future cash flows are both significant andsubjective, particularly considering the current economic environment. The level of future homeprice declines, the duration and severity of the current economic downturn, the impact of variousgovernment programs and actions, uncertainties about borrower behavior, and the lack of marketliquidity and transparency are factors that have influenced, and may continue to affect, theseassumptions and estimates.In accounting for these loans on an ongoing basis, probable decreases in expected loan principalcash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through the provision for loan losses, whileprobable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased principal credit losses,the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loanlosses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over theremaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. The impact of (i)&nbsp;prepayments, (ii)&nbsp;changes invariable interest rates and (iii)&nbsp;any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows would berecognized prospectively as yield adjustments. The process to determine which changes in cash flowstrigger the recognition of impairment, and which changes in cash flows should be recognized asyield adjustments, requires the application of judgment. As of September&nbsp;30, 2010, a 1% decrease inexpected future principal cash payments for the entire portfolio of PCI loans would result in therecognition of an allowance for loan losses for these loans of approximately $710&nbsp;million. Foradditional information on PCI loans, including the significant assumptions, estimates and judgmentinvolved, see PCI loans on pages 129&#150;130 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report and Note 13 onpages 149&#150;154 of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. For a description ofthe significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, see Goodwill impairment onpage 130 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010, the Firm updated the discounted cash flowvaluations of certain consumer lending businesses in RFS and CS, which continue to have elevatedrisk for goodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects ofregulatory and legislative changes. The assumptions used in the valuation of these businessesinclude a) estimates of future cash flows for the business (which are dependent on portfoliooutstanding balances, net interest margin, operating expense, credit losses and the amount ofcapital necessary given therisk of business activities and to meet regulatory capital requirements), and b) the cost of equityused to discount those cash flows to a present value. Each of these factors require significantjudgment and the assumptions used are based on management's best and most current projections,including the anticipated effects of regulatory and legislativechanges, (including the CARD Act)derived from the Firm's business forecasting process reviewed with senior management. Theseprojections are consistent with the short-term assumptions discussed in the Business Outlook on pages9&#150;10 of this Form 10-Q, and, in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions (forexample, allowing for relatively high but gradually declining unemployment rates for the next fewyears) and the Firm's best estimates of long-term growth of its businesses. Where possible, theFirm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.In addition, for its other businesses, the Firm reviewed current conditions (including theestimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and limitationson non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees) and prior projections of business performance. Basedupon the updated valuations for its consumer lending businesses and reviews of its otherbusinesses, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to all of its reporting units was notimpaired during 2010. However, the fair value of the credit card lending businesswithin CS and a consumer lending business within RFS exceeded their carrying values by narrowmargins at September&nbsp;30, June&nbsp;30, and March&nbsp;31, 2010, ranging from 3&#150;21%. Deterioration in economicmarket conditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes,or additional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected businessperformance beyond management's current expectations. For example, in CS, such declines could result fromdeterioration in economic conditions such as increased unemployment claims or bankruptcy filingsthat result in increased credit losses, changes in customer behavior that cause decreased accountactivity or receivable balances, or unanticipated effects of regulatory or legislative changes. InRFS, such declines could result from deterioration in economic conditions that result in increasedcredit losses, including decreases in home prices beyond management expectations.Such declines in business performance, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could causethe estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline,which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to someportion of the associated goodwill.For additional information on goodwill, see Note 16 on pages 167&#150;170 of this Form 10-Q.Income taxesFor a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with theaccounting for income taxes, see Income taxes on page 131 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.106 Table of ContentsACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTSAccounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entitiesEffective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm implemented new accounting guidance that amends the accountingfor the transfers of financial assets and the consolidation of VIEs. Upon adoption of the newguidance, the Firm consolidated its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts,Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and certain mortgage and other consumer loan securitizationentities. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) deferred the requirements of the newconsolidation guidance for VIEs for certain investment funds, including mutual funds, privateequity funds and hedge funds, until the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board(&#147;IASB&#148;) complete a joint consolidation project that would provide consistent accounting guidancefor these funds. For additional information about the impact of the adoption of the newconsolidation guidance on January&nbsp;1, 2010, see Note 15 on pages 155&#150;167 of this Form 10-Q.Fair value measurements and disclosuresIn January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires new disclosures, and clarifies existingdisclosure requirements, about fair value measurements. The clarifications and the requirement toseparately disclose transfers of instruments between level 1 and level 2 of the fair valuehierarchy are effective for interim reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2009; the Firmadopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2010. For additional information about the impact ofthe adoption of the new fair value measurements guidance, see Note 3 on pages 114&#150;128 of this Form10-Q. In addition, a new requirement to provide purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in thelevel 3 rollforward on a gross basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,2010. Early adoption of the guidance is permitted.Subsequent eventsIn May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance that established general standards of accounting for anddisclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements areissued or are available to be issued. The guidance was effective for interim or annual financialperiods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. In February&nbsp;2010, the FASB amended the guidance by eliminatingthe requirement for SEC filers to disclose the date through which it evaluated subsequent events.The Firm adopted the amended guidance in the first quarter of 2010. The application of the guidancehad no effect on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.Accounting for certain embedded credit derivativesIn March&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the circumstances in which a credit derivativeembedded in beneficial interests in securitized financial assets is required to be separatelyaccounted for as a derivative instrument. The guidance is effective for the first fiscal quarterbeginning after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the new guidancepermits the election of the fair value option for beneficial interests in securitized financialassets. The Firm adopted the new guidance prospectively, effective July&nbsp;1, 2010. The adoption ofthe guidance did not have a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results ofoperations. For additional information about the impact of the adoption of the new guidance, seeNote 5 on pages 132&#150;140 on this Form 10-Q.Accounting for modifications of purchased credit-impaired loans that are part of a poolIn April&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for modifications of PCI loansaccounted for within a pool. The guidance clarifies that modified PCI loans should not be removedfrom a pool even if the modification would otherwise be considered a TDR. Additionally, theguidance clarifies that the impact of modifications should be included in evaluating whether a poolof loans is impaired. The guidance was effective for the Firm beginning in the third quarter of2010, and is to be applied prospectively. The guidance is consistent with the Firm's previouslyexisting accounting practice and, therefore, had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated BalanceSheets or results of operations.Disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit lossesIn July&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance that will require enhanced disclosures surrounding thecredit characteristics of the Firm's loan portfolio. Under the new guidance, the Firm will berequired to disclose its accounting policies, the methods it uses to determine the components ofthe allowance for credit losses, and qualitative and quantitative information about the credit riskinherent in the loan portfolio, including additional information on certain types of loanmodifications. For the Firm, the new disclosures are effective for the 2010 Annual Report. The newdisclosures on the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses and the new disclosures abouttroubled-debt modifications are effective for the first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q.

(&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;), a financial holding company incorporatedunder Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largestbanking institutions in the United States of America (&#147;U.S.&#148;), with operations worldwide. The Firmis a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and businesses, financialtransaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm's business-segmentinformation, see Note 23 on pages 178-182 of this Form 10-Q.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform toaccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelinesprescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The unaudited consolidated financial statements preparedin conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingentassets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion ofmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of thisinterim financial information. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read inconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, includedin JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, as filed withthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;2009 Annual Report&#148;).Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.ConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities inwhich the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances andtransactions have been eliminated. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financialinterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or avariable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;).Voting interest entitiesVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investorsvoting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations.For these types of entities, the Firm's determination of whether it has a controlling interest isprimarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has acontrolling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities' voting equityinterests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by theFirm.Investments in companies that are considered to be voting interest entities in which the Firm hassignificant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of thevoting equity interests) are accounted for (i)&nbsp;in accordance with the equity method of accounting(which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity's net earnings), or(ii)&nbsp;at fair value, if the fair value option was elected at the inception of the Firm's investment.These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in otherincome.Firm-sponsored asset management funds are generally structured as limited partnerships or limitedliability companies and are typically considered voting interest entities. For the significantmajority of these entities, for which the Firm is the general partner or managing member of thelimited partnership or limited liability company (&#147;LLC&#148;), the non-affiliated partners or membershave the substantive ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member withoutcause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or the non-affiliatedpartners or members have substantive participating rights. Accordingly, the Firm does notconsolidate these funds. In limited cases where the non-affiliated partners or members do not havesubstantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm consolidates the underlying funds.TheFirm's investment companies make investments in both public and private entities, including investments in buyouts,growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investmentcompany guidelines and accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interestsheld, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and are recorded in OtherAssets.112 Table of ContentsVariable interest entitiesVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1)&nbsp;lack sufficient equity to permit the entity tofinance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2)have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to theentity's operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expectedlosses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.The most common type of VIE is a special-purpose entity (&#147;SPE&#148;). SPEs are commonly used insecuritization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows fromthose assets to investors. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, including themortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide marketliquidity by facilitating investors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. SPEs may beorganized as trusts, partnerships or corporations and are typically established for a single,discrete purpose. SPEs are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and noemployees. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds thepurchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern thetransaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE's investors andother parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulateinvestors from claims on the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditorsof the seller of the assets.On January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm implemented new consolidation accounting guidance related to VIEs. Thenew guidance eliminates the concept of qualified special purpose entities (&#147;QSPEs&#148;) that werepreviously exempt from consolidation and introduces a new framework for determining the primarybeneficiary of a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets andliabilities of the VIE. Under the new guidance, the primary beneficiary is the party that has both(1)&nbsp;the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE'seconomic performance; and (2)&nbsp;through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses orthe right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantlyimpact the VIE's economic performance, the Firm considers all facts and circumstances, includingits role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessmentincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economicperformance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. Ingeneral, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as assetmanagers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over theVIE's assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have thepower to direct the activities of a VIE.To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receivebenefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all ofits economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivative orother arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that theFirm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are consideredpotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: thedesign of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; paymentpriority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE's capitalstructure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: 1) whether any entities previously evaluated under themajority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are thereforesubject to the VIE consolidation framework; and 2) whether changes in the facts and circumstancesregarding the Firm's involvement with a VIE cause the Firm's consolidation conclusion regarding theVIE to change.For further details regarding the Firm's application of the new accounting guidance effectiveJanuary&nbsp;1, 2010, see Note 15 on pages 155-167 of this Form 10-Q. For a description of theaccounting guidance applied to periods ending prior to January&nbsp;1, 2010, see Note 1 on page 142 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.In February&nbsp;2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an amendment whichdefers the requirements of the new consolidation accounting guidance for certain investment funds,including mutual funds, private equity funds and hedge funds. For funds to which the amendmentapplies, the consolidation guidance will be deferred until the completion of the FASB andInternational Accounting Standards Board (&#147;IASB&#148;) joint consolidation project. For the funds towhich the amendment applies, the Firm continues to apply other existing authoritative guidance todetermine whether such funds should be consolidated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.113 Table of ContentsNOTE 2 &#151; BUSINESS CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Purchase of remaining interest in J.P. Morgan CazenoveOn January&nbsp;4, 2010, JPMorgan Chase purchased the remaining interest in J.P. Morgan Cazenove, aninvestment banking business partnership formed in 2005, which resulted in an adjustment to theFirm's capital surplus of approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion.RBS Sempra transactionOn July&nbsp;1, 2010, JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of RBS Sempra Commodities' global oil,global metals and European power and gas businesses. The Firm acquired approximately $1.7&nbsp;billionof net assets which included $3.3&nbsp;billion of debt which was immediately repaid. This acquisitionalmost doubled the number of clients the Firm's commodities business can serve and will enable theFirm to offer them more products in more regions of the world.Redemption of Series&nbsp;E, F and G cumulative preferred stockOn August&nbsp;20, 2010, JPMorgan Chase redeemed, at stated redemption value, all outstanding shares ofits 6.15% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;E; 5.72% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;F, and5.49% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;G. For a further discussion of preferred stock, see Note23 on pages 222-223 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.NOTE 3 &#151; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For a further discussion of the Firm's valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities andlending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 3 onpages 148-165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.During the first nine months of 2010, no changes were made to the Firm's valuation models thathad, or were expected to have, a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets orresults of operations.114 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September&nbsp;30,2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis115 Table of Contents116 Table of Contents117 Table of Contents&nbsp;Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts (including changes in fairvalue) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009. When a determination is made toclassify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance ofthe unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financialinstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observablecomponents (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part toobservable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages theobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positionsthat are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables donot reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3instruments.118 Table of Contents119 Table of Contents120 Table of Contents121 Table of Contents&nbsp;122 Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value ona nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but aresubject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there isevidence of impairment). The following tables present the assets and liabilities carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheets by caption and level within the valuation hierarchy as of the periodsindicated for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the reportingperiod.&nbsp;The method used to estimate the fair value of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and otherloans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g.,residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), depends on the typeof collateral (e.g., securities, real estate, nonfinancial assets). Fair value of the collateral isestimated based on quoted market prices, broker quotes or independent appraisals, or by using a DCFmodel. For further information, see Note 14 on pages 154&#151;155 of this Form 10-Q.Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fairvalue adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three- andnine-month periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, related to financial instruments held atthose dates.123 Table of ContentsLevel 3 analysisLevel 3 assets at September&nbsp;30, 2010, principally include derivative receivables, mortgageservicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;), trading loans, and collateralized loan obligations (&#147;CLOs&#148;) held withinthe available-for-sale securities portfolio. For further discussion of JPMorgan Chase's valuationmethodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, see Note 3 on pages 148&#151;165 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Consolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 6% of totalFirm assets at September&nbsp;30, 2010. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assetsduring the quarter.For the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010Level 3assets were $120.6&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2010,reflecting an increase of $760&nbsp;millionfrom the second quarter.The increase is mainly due to:For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010Level 3 assets decreased by $9.8&nbsp;billion in the first nine months of 2010, due to the following:124 Table of ContentsGains and LossesIncluded in the tables for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010Included in the tables for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009Included in the tables for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010Included in the tables for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009Credit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuationadjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are notlimited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm's own creditworthiness. Themarket's view of the Firm's credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the creditdefault swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, seeNote 3 on pages 148&#151;165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity,reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.&nbsp;125 Table of ContentsThe following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respectiveperiods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.&nbsp;Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments (including financialinstruments not carried at fair value)U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value ofcertain financial instruments, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate theirfair value. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included inthe following table. Additionally, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instrumentsare excluded from the scope. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures provided in the followingtable include only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, the Firmhas developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit cardaccounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In theopinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, buttheir fair value is not disclosed in this Note.Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair valueCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheetsare carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generallynegligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks; deposits with banks,federal funds sold; securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed withshort-dated maturities; short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable; commercial paper;federal funds purchased; securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements with short-datedmaturities; other borrowed funds (excluding advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks (&#147;FHLBs&#148;));accounts payable; and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value fordeposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money marketdeposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of theseinstruments is not permitted.126 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial assets andliabilities.&nbsp;127 Table of ContentsThe majority of the Firm's unfunded lending-related commitments are not carried at fair valueon a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carryingvalue and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending&#151;related commitments were as followsfor the periods indicated.&nbsp;The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending&#151;related commitments. In manycases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower prior notice or,in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. For a further discussion of the valuation oflending-related commitments, see Note 3 on pages 149&#151;150 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Trading assets and liabilities &#151; average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.&nbsp;128 Table of ContentsNOTE 4 &#151; FAIR VALUE OPTION For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which fair value elections have beenmade, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific creditrisk, where relevant, see Note 4 on pages 165&#151;167 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.2010 ElectionsThe fair value option was elected in connection with the adoption of the new accounting guidancerelated to:Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements ofIncome for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, for items for which thefair value election was made. The profit and loss information presented below only includes thefinancial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk managementinstruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.129 Table of Contents130 Table of ContentsDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregateremaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31,2009, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value optionhas been elected.131 Table of ContentsNOTE 5 &#151; DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS For a further discussion of the Firm's use and accounting policies regarding derivativeinstruments, see Note 5 on pages 167&#151;175 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm'sderivative activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possiblelosses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notionalamount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.132 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following tables summarize information on derivative fair values that are reflected on theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, by accountingdesignation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.Free-standing derivatives(a)Derivative receivables and payables mark-to-marketThe following table summarizes the fair values of derivative receivables and payables, includingthose designated as hedges by contract type after netting adjustments as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009.133 Table of ContentsImpact ofderivatives and hedged items on the income statement and on othercomprehensive incomeThe following tables summarize the total pretax impact of JPMorgan Chase's derivative-relatedactivities on the Firm's Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income for thethree and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, by accounting designation.Consolidated Statements of IncomeConsolidated Statements of IncomeOther comprehensive income/(loss)Other comprehensive income/(loss)134 Table of ContentsThe tables that follow reflect more detailed information regarding the derivative-relatedincome statement impact by accounting designation for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30,2010 and 2009, respectively.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedgeaccounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and therelated hedged items for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the sameline item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.135 Table of ContentsCash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedgeaccounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the threeand nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss)on the hedging derivative in the same line item as the offsetting change in cash flows on thehedged item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, the Firm expects that $327&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin AOCI at September&nbsp;30, 2010, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. Themaximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and suchtransactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.136 Table of ContentsNet investment hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in netinvestment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on suchinstruments for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Risk management derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedging instruments)The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated inhedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the three andnine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These derivatives are risk managementinstruments used to mitigate or transform the risk of market exposures arising from bankingactivities other than trading activities, which are discussed separately below.137 Table of ContentsTrading derivative gains and lossesThe following table presents trading derivatives gains and losses, by contract type, that arerecorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the threeand nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Firm has elected to presentderivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with the cash instrumentswith which they are risk managed.Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresDerivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typicallyrequire the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the mark-to-market(&#147;MTM&#148;) moves in the counterparties' favor, or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's or itssubsidiaries' respective credit ratings. At September&nbsp;30, 2010, the impact of a single-notch andsix-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan ChaseBank, National Association (&#147;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#148;) would have required $1.9&nbsp;billion and $5.0billion, respectively, of additional collateral to be posted by the Firm. Certain derivativecontracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either theFirm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. At September&nbsp;30, 2010, theimpact of single-notch and six-notch ratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and itssubsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., related to contracts with termination triggerswould have required the Firm to settle trades with a fair value of $156&nbsp;million and $4.0&nbsp;billion,respectively. The aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingentcollateral or termination features triggered upon a downgrade was $37.2&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2010, for which the Firm has posted collateral of $35.7&nbsp;billion in the normal course of business.The following tables show the current credit risk of derivative receivables after nettingadjustments and collateral received, and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables afternetting adjustments and collateral posted, as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009,respectively.In addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the tables above, at September&nbsp;30, 2010,and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm had received liquid securities and other cash collateral in theamount of $20.8&nbsp;billion and $15.5&nbsp;billion, respectively, and posted $15.7&nbsp;billion and $11.7billion, respectively. The Firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation ofderivative transactions, which is available as security against potential exposure that could ariseshould the fair value of the transactions move in the Firm's or client's favor, respectively.Furthermore, the Firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have anon-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted, and collateral that the Firm or acounterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. At September30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm had received $19.7&nbsp;billion and $16.9&nbsp;billion,respectively, and delivered $10.7&nbsp;billion and $5.8&nbsp;billion, respectively, of such additionalcollateral. These amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in thetables above, because, at an individual counterparty level, the collateral exceeded the fair valueexposure at both September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.138 Table of ContentsCredit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including a description of the differenttypes used by the Firm, see Note 5 on pages 167&#151;175, of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Effective July&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance prospectively related to creditderivatives embedded in beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, which resulted in theelection of the fair value option for certain instruments in the AFS securities portfolio. Therelated cumulative effect adjustment increased retained earnings and decreased accumulated othercomprehensive income by $15&nbsp;million, respectively, as of July&nbsp;1, 2010.The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentageof the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid onthe contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time ofsettlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasingprotection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protectionreferenced in the following tables include credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical,reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well asprotection purchased through credit-related notes.The Firm does not use notional amounts as the primary measure of risk management for creditderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of theoccurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cashinstruments and economic hedges.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, where JPMorgan Chase is theseller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of thecredit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity onwhich the credit derivative contract is based.

Unrealized losses oncertain securities have increased, including on corporate debt securities which includedgovernment-guaranteed positions that experienced credit spread widening. As of September&nbsp;30, 2010,the Firm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likelythat the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized costbasis. Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have beenrecognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are notother-than-temporarily impaired as of September&nbsp;30, 2010.Followingis a description of the Firm's principal security investments with the most significantunrealized losses as of September&nbsp;30, 2010, and the key assumptions used in its estimate of thepresent value of the cash flows most likely to be collected from these investments.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; Prime and Alt-A nonagencyAs of September&nbsp;30, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residentialmortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers were $328&nbsp;million, all of which related tosecurities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12&nbsp;months or more. Overall losses havedecreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, due to increased market stabilization, resulting from increaseddemand for higher-yielding asset classes and U.S. governmentprograms. Approximately 19% ofthese positions (by amortized cost) are currently rated&#147;AAA.&#148; The remaining 81% haveexperienced downgrades since purchase, and approximately 80% of the downgraded positions arecurrently rated below investment-grade. Approximately 35% of the portfolio remainsinvestment-grade. The remaining 65% is below investment-grade; the Firm recordedother-than-temporary impairment losses on 46% of the below investment-grade positions in priorperiods. The Firm expects to recover the current amortized cost basis of its below investment-gradesecurities based on the current and projected performance of the underlying loans and creditenhancements. The credit enhancements associated with the below investment-grade andinvestment-grade portfolios are 10.1% and 28.2%, respectively. In analyzing prime and Alt-146 Table of ContentsA residential mortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses, the Firm utilizes a methodologythat focuses on loan-level detail to estimate future cash flows, which are then applied to the various tranches ofissued securities based on their respective contractual provisions of the securitization trust. Theloan-level analysis considers prepayment, home price, default rate and loss severity assumptions.Given this level of granularity, the underlying assumptions vary significantly taking intoconsideration such factors as loan-to-value (&#147;LTV&#148;) ratio, loan type and geographical location ofthe underlying property. The weighted average underlying default rate on the positions was 19% andthe related weighted average loss severity was 49%. Based on this analysis, the Firm has notrecognized any additional OTTI losses in earnings during the third quarter of 2010; however, anOTTI loss of $6&nbsp;million was recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to securities thatexperienced increased delinquency rates associated with specific collateral types and originationdates. The unrealized loss of $328&nbsp;million is considered temporary, based on management'sassessment that the credit enhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support theFirm's investment.Asset-backed securities &#151; Collateralized loan obligationsAs of September&nbsp;30, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to CLOs were $197&nbsp;million, of which $187million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12&nbsp;months or more.Overall losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, mainly as a result of lower defaultforecasts and spread tightening across various asset classes. Substantially all of these securitiesare rated &#147;AAA,&#148; &#147;AA&#148; and &#147;A&#148; and have an average credit enhancement of 30%. Credit enhancement inCLOs is primarily in the form of overcollateralization, which is the excess of the par amount ofcollateral over the par amount of securities. The key assumptions considered in analyzing potentialcredit losses were underlying loan and debt security defaults and loss severity. Based on currentdefault trends, the Firm assumed collateral default rates of 5% for the third quarter 2010 andthereafter. Further, loss severities were assumed to be 50% for loans and 80% for debt securities.Losses on collateral were estimated to occur approximately 24&nbsp;months after default.147 Table of ContentsContractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2010, ofJPMorgan Chase's AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.148 Table of ContentsNOTE 12 &#151; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 12 onpage 192 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.

The above amounts of assets pledged do notinclude assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of thoseentities. See Note 15 on pages 155&#150;167 of this Form 10-Q for additional information on assets andliabilities of consolidated VIEs.AtSeptember&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firmaccepted assets as collateral that it couldrepledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $691.7&nbsp;billion and$635.6&nbsp;billion. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securitiesborrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of these securities,approximately $566.9&nbsp;billion and $472.7&nbsp;billion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used,generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, derivativeagreements, to collateralize deposits, or to cover short sales.
