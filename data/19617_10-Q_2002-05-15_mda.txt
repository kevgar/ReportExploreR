Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEWbp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.O/(U) &#151; Denotes over and under 2001 amounts.Financial Highlights: Reported net income was $982&nbsp;million, or $0.48 per share,in the first quarter of 2002. This compared with $1,199&nbsp;million, or $0.58 pershare, in the first quarter of 2001.First quarter 2002 operating earnings were$0.57 per share, compared with $0.17 in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $0.74 inthe first quarter of 2001. Operating earnings were $1,150&nbsp;million in the firstquarter 2002, compared with $356&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and$1,527&nbsp;million one year ago. Operating earnings for 2001 have been adjusted byadding back amortization of goodwill to present 2001 results on a basiscomparable to this year's first quarter, which included the impact of theimplementation of SFAS 142.Operating earnings in the 2002 first quarter were negatively affected by threebroad trends. The first trend was the deterioration in credit qualityof the consumer and commercial loan portfolios. Commercial net charge-offs were 127 bp of thecommercial loan portfolio and nonperforming commercial assets increased $347&nbsp;million from year-end. Consumernet charge-offs were 2.22% in the 2002 first quarter and 1.98% in the fourthquarter of 2001. The second trend adversely affecting first quarter earnings wasthe continued decline in private equity valuations, which resulted in negativeearnings at JPMorgan Partners. Finally, the continued weakness in capitalmarkets activities, particularly in the IPO and M&A marketplace, adverselyaffected revenues at the Investment Bank. Investment banking fees of $741million represented the lowest quarterly total in the last three years.Nevertheless, during the first quarter 2002, therewas significant progress by otherareas of the Firm. First quarter results reflected very strong revenue growth inRetail & Middle Market Financial Services (&#147;RMMFS&#148;) and improved margins inInvestment Management & Private Banking (&#147;IMPB&#148;). Earnings at RMMFS at $526million for the quarter represented 25% growth from the first quarter of2001. IMPB earnings increased 30% from the fourth quarter of 2001 as a result oflower expenses which increased the pre-tax operating margin to 22%.In addition, despite the challenging capital market environment, the InvestmentBank maintained leadership positions in loan syndication and investment-gradebonds and, for the first time, ranked as the third leading underwriter of stocksand bonds globally. Management believes there are early indicationsthat credit quality has begun to stabilize and that private equity exitopportunities, although muted, have begun to improve across several industries,particularly in the industrial and consumer sectors. Loan loss provisionsequaled net charge-offs in the 2002 first quarter, in contrast to the fourthquarter of 2001 where provisions of $650&nbsp;million in excess of charge-offs wererecorded.17 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Finally, during the first quarter, the Firm continued to be focused onmaintaining expense and capital discipline. Operating expenses in the firstquarter of 2002, although higher than the fourth quarter of 2001, included $106million in nonmerger-related severance costs, $78&nbsp;million related to thesettlement of litigation with Sumitomo Corporation and $46&nbsp;million in operatingcosts related to the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust.Management is targeting lower operating expenses for full year 2002 versusfull-year 2001. In addition, strong capital and liquidity positions remained apriority for the Firm. Until the revenue environment becomes stronger,management will continue to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio that is somewhathigher than the announced long-term target of 8.0%-8.25% and to take actions to raiseadditional liquidity and to extend the average maturities of the Firm's debtobligations. Management continues to believe these actions will enable the Firmto produce higher returns when the economy more fully recovers.RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED TO OPERATING RESULTSThe Firm prepares its financial statements using generally accepted accountingprinciples (&#147;GAAP&#148;). This presentation is referred to as the &#147;reported basis.&#148;The Firm also analyzes its results on an &#147;operating basis&#148; which starts with thereported GAAP results and then excludes the impact of merger and restructuringcosts and special items. For a further discussion on the reconciliation betweenreported and operating results, see page 27 of the 2001 Annual Report.The following summary table provides a reconciliation between the Firm'sreported and operating results.(in millions, except per share data)18 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)SEGMENT RESULTSJPMorgan Chase's segment results reflect the manner in which financial information currently is evaluated by theFirm's management. For a discussion of the Firm'smethodology of allocating equity to its business units see page 29of the 2001 Annual Report. The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basis for the fivemajor business segments.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.O/(U) &#151; Denotes over and under 2001 amounts.19 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the Investment Bank, see pages 30-31 of the JPMorgan Chase 2001Annual Report. The following table sets forth selected financial data of the Investment Bank.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.The Investment Bank had operating earnings of $755&nbsp;million in the 2002 firstquarter, more than double the fourth quarter of 2001 but 27% lower than thefirst quarter of 2001. Operating ROE was 16% for the 2002 first quarter comparedwith 8% for the 2001 fourth quarter and 21% for the first quarter of 2001. Thedecline in earnings relative to the first quarter of last year reflected a 16%decline in revenues and an $187 million increase in credit costs, partially offset by a17% decline in expenses. In comparison with the fourth quarter of 2001, revenuegrowth of 17% and lower credit costs of 54% drove the doubling of earnings.Trading revenues (including related net interest income) of $1.70&nbsp;billionincreased 66% from the fourth quarter of 2001 which included the impact of $359million in losses relating to Enron and Argentina. In comparison with lastyear's strong first quarter, trading revenues declined 19% primarily due tolower equity trading revenues as a result of lower client activity and lowervolatility. In addition, fixed income trading was lower when compared with thefirst quarter of 2001 as strong credit trading results in the quarter wereoffset by lower interest rate trading, reflecting reduced opportunities fromdeclining rates that existed one year ago.Investment banking fees were $741&nbsp;million in the 2002 first quarter, the lowestquarterly level in the last three years. The declines from each of the fourthand first quarters of 2001 reflected continued weakness in the M&A and equityunderwriting markets as well as lower loan syndication activity. For thequarter, leadership positions were maintained in syndicated lending (#1) andhigh-grade bonds (#2), in a much weaker environment.20 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Fees and commissions of $380&nbsp;million in the 2002 first quarter increased by 5%from the fourth quarter of 2001 but declined 10% from the first quarter of 2001.The year-on-year decline was primarily due to lower commissions from equitybrokerage activities.Operating expenses for the 2002 first quarter of $2.12&nbsp;billion increased by 14%from the fourth quarter of 2001 but declined 17% from the first quarter of lastyear. Expenses in the first quarter 2002 included incremental costs associated withthe Sumitomo settlement and severance-related costs beyond the previouslyplanned merger and restructuring costs. Operating expenses also increased fromthe fourth quarter in part due to higher incentives linked to improved revenuesand earnings. Despite the expense pressures created by the severance costs andlitigation settlement, the overhead ratio for the 2002 first quarter was 58%reflecting ongoing productivity and expense management initiatives. Theseexpense initiatives are intended to allow the Investment Bank to make strategicinvestments despite the current revenue environment. The first quarter'soverhead ratio is lower than the Investment Bank's announced target of 60% anddemonstrates the Investment Bank's discipline in managing expenses particularlyin light of the effect of higher credit costs on earnings.TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;T&SS&#148;), see pages 32-33 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report. Thefollowing table sets forth selected financial data of Treasury & SecuritiesServices.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.Treasury & Securities Services had operating earnings of $141&nbsp;million in thefirst quarter of 2002, 14% lower than the 2001 fourth quarter and 16% lower thanthe first quarter of 2001. Despite the lower earnings in the first quarter, theoperating ROE was 19%.Operating revenues were $935&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002, down 1% fromthe 2001 fourth quarter and down 2% from the first quarter of 2001. Revenues atInvestor Services declined 10% from the first quarter of 2001 as a result ofweak global equity markets and lower asset levels, reduced international moneyflows and lower business activity. Institutional Trust Services revenuesincreased 6% from both the fourth and first quarters of 2001 reflecting theimpact of an acquisition, partially offset by slower fixed income activity.Treasury Services revenues were down 5% from the fourth quarter but up 4% fromthe first quarter of 2001, as the effect of lower interest rates was offset byhigher overall deposit levels resulting from increased business volumes.21 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expenses rose 4% from the 2001 fourth quarter and 3% from the firstquarter of 2001. With continued pressure on revenue growth, each of thebusinesses are focusing on expense initiatives. In particular, Investor Servicesis evaluating the right level of staffing and infrastructure, with several SixSigma projects underway.T&SS's overhead ratio for the first quarter was 77%, upfrom 73% in both the fourth and first quarters of 2001. In the 2002 firstquarter, the Firm adopted EITF 01-14, &#147;Income Statement Characterization ofReimbursements Received for &#145;Out-of-Pocket' ExpensesIncurred,&#148; which principallyimpacted the T&SS business. This adoption caused T&SS's first quarter 2002revenues and expenses each to increase by $51&nbsp;million which had the effect ofincreasing the overhead ratio by 1.4%. Results for 2001 were restated for this adoption,which increased T&SS's revenues and expenses by $52&nbsp;million in the first quarterand $217&nbsp;million for the full year. As a result of this change, the targetoverhead ratio of 65% for T&SS will be increased by 1.5-2.0%.RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of Retail & Middle Market Financial Services (&#147;RMMFS&#148;) and adiscussion of the profiles for each business, see pages 38-40 of JPMorganChase's 2001 Annual Report. The following table reflects selected financial datafor RMMFS.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.Retail & Middle Market Financial Services had record operating earnings of $526million for the first quarter of 2002, up 59% from the 2001 fourth quarter andan increase of 25% from the first quarter of 2001. Operating ROE for the firstquarter was 22%, compared with 14% in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 20% for thefirst quarter of 2001.Operating revenues of $3.13&nbsp;billion (including$152&nbsp;million of revenues from theProvidian Master Trust card portfolio) were up 7% and 18% from the fourth andfirst quarters of 2001, respectively. Credit card outstandings grew 31% to $49billion. Internally generated new accounts exceeded 900,000 for the quarter.Mortgage originations totaled $33&nbsp;billion in the quarter, down from $50&nbsp;billionin the 2001 fourth quarter but up from the first quarter of 2001. Auto financeoriginations were a record $5.8&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2002, up 2% fromthe fourth quarter of 2001 and 34% over the first quarter of 2001. Total RMMFSdeposits were up 5% and 14% from the fourth and first quarters of 2001,respectively, as economic uncertainty and interest rate decreases have causedcustomers to seek liquidity. As a result, deposit balances have grown athigher than normal rates.Operating expenses of $1.56&nbsp;billion increased by 4% from the fourth quarter of2001 and by 13% from the first quarter of 2001. The increases reflected theimpact of the Providian Master Trust acquisition as well as higher expensesrelated to production volumes. Partially offsetting these increases were savingsrelated to Six Sigma and other productivity programs. The overhead ratio for thefirst quarter was 50%, compared with 51% for the fourth quarter and 52% lastyear.Credit costs of $726&nbsp;million were 22% lower than the 2001 fourth quarter, whichincluded $250&nbsp;million in provision in excess of charge-offs, but were 22% higherthan the first quarter of 2001, partially due to higher outstandings.22 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within RMMFS.NM &#151; Not meaningful.Cardmember ServicesCardmember Services' operating earnings of $147&nbsp;million in the first quarter of2002 increased 50% from the comparable quarter of last year reflecting theFebruary&nbsp;5, 2002 acquisition of the Providian Master Trust. Operating revenuesrose 35% from the first quarter of last year driven by lower funding costs,a higher level of receivables as well as higher credit card fees. Fees reflectedhigher transaction volume (customer purchases, cash advances and balancetransfers), as well as higher levels of delinquencies, which increased latefees. The decline in operating earnings from the fourth quarter of 2001reflected the normal seasonal decline from peak purchase volume in the holidayseason. Operating revenues increased 7% from the fourth quarter of 2001 due tothe Providian acquisition. The overhead ratio decreased from first quarter 2001to 35% due to strong revenue growth, including the positive impact of theProvidian acquisition.The managed net charge-off rate was 5.82% for the first quarter of 2002, anincrease of 26 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2001, resulting fromincreased bankruptcies and contractual charge-offs partially offset by higheroutstandings. The loss rate associated with the Providian card portfolio wasonly 6.3% for the two months, reflecting purchases of non-impaired accounts. Forthe remainder of the year, the Providian credit card receivables will contributeto a higher managed charge-off rate versus the prior year.Regional Banking GroupRegional Banking Group's first quarter 2002 operating revenues of $731&nbsp;milliondeclined 9% and operating earnings were lower by 12% from last year. The declinein operating revenue reflected the low interest rate environment, whichunfavorably affected the net interest earned on deposit balances, despite agrowth of 12% in the overall level of retail deposits. Partially offsetting thedecline were higher fee revenues associated with deposit service fees and volumegrowth in the Chase Banking Card. Operating revenues decreased 2% from thefourth quarter of 2001, while operating earnings increased from the fourthquarter of 2001 due to lower credit costs. The overhead ratio increasedfrom the same period last year to 74% as a result of lower revenue, primarilydue to lower interest rates, and higher expenses.Home FinanceHome Finance's operating revenues and operating earnings increased 46% and 50%,respectively, for the first quarter of 2002 over the same period in the prioryear. Revenue growth was fueled by a strong housing market and the positiveimpact of lower interest rates, which resulted in improved warehouse spreads andlower funding costs on mortgage servicing rights (&#147;MSR&#148;) and contributed to an 8% growth in servicingbalances. Originations (residential, home equity and manufactured housing) forthe first quarter of 2002 were $33&nbsp;billion and included originations from theretail, wholesale and correspondent (traditional and negotiated) channels. Themortgage servicing portfolio was $425&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002. The overheadratio decreased to 55% from the same quarter last year due to strong revenuegrowth.23 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Middle MarketsMiddle Market's operating revenues in the 2002 first quarter were up 2% from thefirst quarter of 2001 and up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2001. The positiveimpact of the higher interest-earning asset levels was partly offset by theeffect of the narrower spreads earned on deposits, driven by the low interestrate environment. Also contributing to the higher revenues was the increase infees earned from deposit transactions as a result of more clients choosing topay fees for their transactions rather than maintaining high levels of depositbalances that would earn minimal interest. The increase in operating earnings ofover 20% versus both periods in 2001 was primarily attributable to the higherrevenues and lower credits costs. The overhead ratio remained relatively flatcompared with the prior year due to steady revenue growth in proportion toexpenses.Auto FinanceAuto Finance's operating revenues increased 53% from 2001's first quarter and 4%from the fourth quarter of 2001. The revenue increase was principally due torecord growth of 34% in originations relative to the first quarter oflast year and afavorable interest rate environment.Operating earnings increased 39% from last year's first quarter, which waspositively affected by the growth in the portfolio, record number oforiginations at higher spreads and increased efficiency in expenses. Operatingearnings decreased 14% from the 2001 fourth quarter due to increased creditcosts. The overhead ratio for the first quarter 2002 was 34%, decreasing fromthe prior year as a result of higher revenue growth in relation to a steadyincrease in originations.INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile of Investment Management & PrivateBanking (&#147;IMPB&#148;) see pages 34-35 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report. Thefollowing table reflects selected financial data for IMPB.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.Investment Management & Private Banking had operating earnings of $126&nbsp;million,up 30% from the 2001 fourth quarter and 19% better than the first quarter of2001. Lower expenses led to an increase in the pre-tax margin in the firstquarter of 2002 to 22% compared with 16% in each of the fourth and firstquarters of 2001. The return on common equity was 8% in the first quarter of2002 (return on tangible common equity, which eliminates goodwill capital,improved to 27%).Operating revenues of $741&nbsp;million in the first quarter were better than the2001 fourth quarter but 10% lower than the first quarter of 2001. Revenuesdecreased due to lower assets under management, reduced earnings on deposits andbrokerage, but were aided by investment performance fees and placement fees onalternative investments. Operating expenses of $557&nbsp;million for the firstquarter of 2002 were 5% lower than the 2001 fourth quarter and down 19% fromlast year's first quarter reflecting the impact of staffing, compensation andother cost reductions taken in 2001. Lower loan quality, due to persistenteconomic weakness, led to a $24&nbsp;million year-on-year increase in credit costswithin the Private Bank.24 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The table below reflects the assets under management in IMPB as of March&nbsp;31, 2002.Total assets under management at quarter-end of $583&nbsp;billion were 4% lower thanthe prior quarter, and 4% lower than the first quarter of 2001. Higher assetsunder management in retail mutual funds reflected growth across all assetclasses, with particular strength in the international sector, where inflowswere at a five-quarter high. This growth was more than offset by outflows withinthe institutional segment, primarily from lower-fee money market funds. In theretail segment, JPMorgan Fleming international mutual funds received 82 awardsfor performance including Best Overall Group and Best-Mixed Asset Manager(Source: Lipper, March 2002).JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMorgan Partners, see pages 36-37of the JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of JPMorgan Partners.NM &#150; Not meaningful.JPMorgan Partners had an operating loss of $248&nbsp;million for the 2002 firstquarter compared with an operating loss of $345&nbsp;million in the 2001 fourthquarter and a small operating loss of $4&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2001.25 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Total private equity gains (losses)&nbsp;for the first quarter 2002 was a negative$255&nbsp;million. During the quarter there were net unrealized losses of $242million, principally due to the decline in value of Triton PCS. Hedging put inplace to partially offset fluctuations in the values of public securitiescontributed $47&nbsp;million in gains in the first quarter. Realized losses in thequarter were $13&nbsp;million which was the net of cash gains of $167&nbsp;million offsetby $180&nbsp;million of write-offs on direct and fund investments. Total privateequity results were negative $398&nbsp;million in the 2001 fourth quarter but apositive $139&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2001. Private equity exitopportunities remain muted in most sectors.26 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Partners Investment PortfolioThe following table presents the carrying values and costs of the JPMP investment portfolio for the dates indicated.The following table presents information about the 10 largest holdings of public securities in the JPMP investmentportfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2002:Technology, media and telecommunications (&#147;TMT&#148;) investments at March&nbsp;31, 2002were $2.1&nbsp;billion, or 24% of the total portfolio, down from 27% at 2001year-end. Management's goal is to continue to decrease TMT investments as apercentage of the total portfolio while increasing the industrial and consumersectors.The Firm believes that JPMP will continue to create value over time. Given thevolatile nature of the markets, and the Nasdaq market in particular, JPMP'sreported results for any period may include significant public securitiesunrealized gains or losses. The Firm makes no assumptions about the unrealizedgains or losses that may be experienced by the JPMP portfolio. JPMP's investmentpace continues to be slow at $139&nbsp;million during the first quarter of 2002 withdeal flow primarily in the life sciences industry.27 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's support units include Enterprise Technology Services, CorporateBusiness Services, legal, audit and finance. For a further discussion of thebusiness profiles of these Support Units as well as a description of Corporate,see page 41 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.NM &#150; Not meaningful.For the first quarter of 2002, Support Units and Corporate had an operating lossof $150&nbsp;million, a positive variance of $47&nbsp;million relative to the prior yearperiod. Included in the first quarter of 2001 was a net loss of $50&nbsp;million atLabMorgan, primarily as a result of investment write-offs. In comparison to thefourth quarter, first quarter 2002 improved by $107&nbsp;million due to a net loss ofapproximately $58&nbsp;million that was included in the fourth quarter related toLabMorgan investments.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Firm's accounting policies are integral to understanding the resultsreported. The Firm's most complex accounting policies require management'sjudgment to ascertain the valuation of certain assets and liabilities. The Firmhas established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended toensure valuation methods are well-controlled and applied consistently fromperiod to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended toensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriatemanner. The Firm's most critical accounting policies involving the moresignificant management valuation judgments involve the accounting for theallowance for loan losses and for the fair value of financial instruments. For afurther description of the types of judgments and estimates required in theseaccounting policies, see page 41 and the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements in the 2001 Annual Report.28 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations both on a reported and operating basis. The differences betweenreported and operating basis are the treatment of revenues from credit cardsecuritizations and the reclassification of trading-related net interest income(&#147;NII&#148;) to trading revenue.Note: There were no special items in either the 2002 or 2001 first quarters.Investment Banking FeesInvestment banking fees of $755&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002 declined$186&nbsp;million from the comparable quarter of last year. The decline reflected thecontinuing weakness in mergers and acquisitions advisory activities, as well asequity securities issuances. Despite the decline, however, the Firm continued togain market share and ranked as the third-leading underwriter of stocks andbonds globally in the first quarter of 2002 (according to Thomson Financial).For a further description of Investment Banking fees, see the Investment Banksegment discussion.Trading-Related RevenueIn the first quarter of 2002, trading-related revenue, which includes $421million of net interest income pertaining to trading activities, declined $447million from the same period a year ago. The decline from the 2001 first quarterwas due to lower equity trading revenue, reflecting lower client activity andlower volatility, as well as lower fixed-income trading revenue, reflectingreduced opportunities when compared with the declining rate environment thatexisted last year. For a further discussion, see the trading-related revenuediscussion in the Investment Bank segment.Fees and CommissionsFees and commissions for first quarter 2002 increased 20% on an operating basiswhen compared with first quarter 2001. The table below provides the significantcomponents of fees and commissions.29 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Investment Management, Custodyand Processing ServicesInvestment management, custody and processing services fees declined from thefirst quarter 2001 reflecting lower values of assets under management andsecurities under safekeeping and fewer cross-border movements of securities.Growth in retail mutual funds across all asset classes was more than offset byoutflows within the institutional segment, primarily outflows from lower-feemoney market funds.Credit Card RevenueThe increase in credit card revenue (operating basis) of $112&nbsp;million, or 29%,over last year's same period was attributable to the growth in the number ofactive credit card accounts and in average receivables outstanding by over $9billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002. The acquisition of the Providian Master Trust, whichclosed in February 2002, contributed to the higher revenues in the firstquarter. The growth in the number of accounts led to increased transactionvolume, higher interchange income, and higher overlimit and balanceconsolidation fees. Also contributing to the increase in fees were the latecharges stemming from the rise in customer delinquencies.The following table reconciles JPMorgan Chase's reported credit card revenue andoperating credit card revenue (which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations).Brokerage and InvestmentServicesBrokerage and investment services in the first quarter of 2002 were lower by $59million than in the first quarter of 2001. The decline reflected the weakermarkets in 2002 which contributed to fewer opportunities to earn agencycommissions from institutional and retail brokerage transactions.Mortgage Servicing FeesIn comparison with the first quarter of 2001, mortgage servicing fees of $48million in the 2002 first quarter were $281&nbsp;million higher than last year,principally reflecting the significant improvement in the impairment charges forthe value of MSRs. The improvement inimpairment charges was attributable to the more stable interest rateenvironment versus last year.As a result of the adoption of SFAS 133, the results of certain hedgingtransactions related to the value of the MSRs are recorded within this line. Inlast year's first quarter, sales of debt securities were used aseconomic hedges of the value of MSRs at Home Finance. Totalsecurities gains in the 2001 first quarter were $315&nbsp;million andwere recognized in the securities gains line (asdiscussed on the following page).Deposit Service ChargesDeposit service charges in the first quarter of 2002 rose $64&nbsp;million or 28%from last year's same quarter. Aside from the higher transaction volume, theincrease in fees reflected the impact of the lower interest rates that promptedinstitutional customers to pay for the deposit services rather than maintain ahigher level of account balances that would earn minimal interest.Other FeesOther fees of $233&nbsp;million in the 2002 first quarter increased $37&nbsp;million fromlast year largely due to the acquisitions of Providian Master Trust and aninstitutional trust services business, which contributed to higher creditcard-related insurance commissions and servicing fees related to corporate trustactivities, respectively. Also contributing to the increase was the highercommissions earned from the sales of variable annuities.30 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Private Equity GainsPrivate equity had a net loss of $238&nbsp;millionin the first quarter of 2002,compared with a net gain of $127&nbsp;million in the prior year's same quarter.Included in the 2002 first quarter were realized losses of $10&nbsp;million, and unrealized losses of $228&nbsp;million driven by thedecline in the value of Triton PCS. Gains on hedges partially offset the loss in the value of public securities held by JPMP. TheFirm may change the nature and type of hedges it enters into with respect to itsprivate equity portfolio, as well as close a hedging position altogether, atany point in time. For a further discussion of the Firm's private equityresults, see the JPMP line of business results on page 25 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.Securities GainsSecurities gains of $114&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002 were significantlylower than the $455&nbsp;million recognized in the same quarter a year ago. Thedecline primarily reflected last year's $315&nbsp;million gain on the sale ofsecurities that were used as economic hedges for the value of mortgage servicingrights at Home Finance. In the first quarter of 2001, the value of theavailable-for-sale securities in the portfolio of Home Finance rosesubstantially as a result of the downward movement in the interest rates thatprevailed at that time.Other RevenueThe net gains on residential mortgage activities (which include originations andsales of loans) were relatively flat compared with the prior year's equivalentquarter, reflecting the continued strength of the housing market driven by thefavorable interest rate environment.All other revenue of $37&nbsp;million declined significantly from the first quarterof 2001.The first quarter of 2002 included writedowns of $57&nbsp;millionof Latin American investments andunfavorable valuationadjustments of $19&nbsp;million related to held-for-sale(&#147;HFS&#148;) commercial loans. The first quarter of 2001 included $65&nbsp;million of gains onthe sale of several nonstrategic businesses in Texas, as well as several retailproperties in New York.Net Interest IncomeOperating NII adjusts reported NII for the impact of credit card securitizations and trading-related NII consideredpart of total trading-related revenue. The following table reconciles reported and operating NII.Net interest income on both reported and operating basis increased from thefirst quarter of last year as a result of the continued low interest rateenvironment. The favorable rate environment led to an increase in managedinterest-earning assets, specifically domestic consumer loans such as creditcard receivables, auto loans and residential mortgages. Also contributing tothe increase in net interest income was the impact of wider spreads on certaininterest-earning assets as the funding costs to carrying these assets declinedfaster than the interest income earned on them.31 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal operating noninterest expense for the quarter was $5.1&nbsp;billion, down 8%from the first quarter of 2001. The decline from the same quarter of last yearwas principally due to the expense management and productivity initiatives thatwere implemented to reduce expense levels given the weak marketenvironment and continuing merger savings due to system integrationefforts. Theinitiatives included containing incentives, which decreased 34% relative to lastyear's first quarter. The lower incentive expense was partially offset by thesettlement costs of the Sumitomo litigation, the severance-related costs beyondthe planned merger and restructuring costs and the incremental expensesrelated to the acquisition of Providian. The following table presents thecomponents of noninterest expense on an operating and reported basis.Compensation ExpenseIn the first quarter of 2002, compensation expense was $2,823&nbsp;million, 15% lowerthan last year's first quarter. The decline in expense was driven by thealignment of incentives with the decrease in revenues, as well as the netreduction in the number of full-time equivalent employees, particularly in areasaffected by the merger, such as the Investment Bank and Investment Management &Private Banking. The decline was partly offset by the impact of annual salaryincreases, the aforementioned severance-related costs and new employees frombusinesses that were acquired after the first quarter of 2001.The Firm had 96,938 full-time equivalent employees at March&nbsp;31, 2002 comparedwith 98,518 at the same period last year. The decline in the number of employeeswas attributable to the right-sizing of positions at the Investment Bank,Investment Management & Private Banking and Corporate Support units. The declinewas partly offset by the recently hired employees at Retail & Middle MarketFinancial Services and Treasury & Securities Services that was necessitated bythe growth in their volume of activities.Occupancy ExpenseIn the 2002 first quarter, Occupancy expense declined slightly from last year'scomparable period due to rental expense savings derived from the consolidationof offices and relocations of certain functions from New York City to New Jerseyand the southern regions of the United States. The savings were partially offsetby the impact of the additional space required by higher business volume atseveral businesses, as well as the marginal escalation in building maintenanceand administration costs.Technology and Communications ExpenseTechnology and communications expense in the first quarter of 2002 increasedslightly when compared with the same period last year. Software expenseincreased due to the purchase of the technologies necessary to support moresophisticated hardware systems, and telecommunications expense grew as a resultof the higher utilization of telephones and improvements in networkconnections. These were offset by the lower costs for leasing and maintainingworkstations and lower expenses for noncapitalized hardware.32 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Amortization of IntangiblesThe increase of $33&nbsp;million (operating basis) in the amortization of intangiblesfor the first quarter of 2002 was primarily the result of the acquisition ofthe Providian Master Trust, which included credit card relationship intangibles.For a further discussion of the amortization of intangibles and the expectedlevel of expense for the remainder of the year, see Note 2.Other ExpenseOther expenses rose only 5% from the first quarter of 2001. The following tablepresents the components of other expense.Merger and Restructuring CostsDuring the first quarter of 2002, the Firm incurred $255&nbsp;million ofrestructuring costs relating to previously announced merger actions,right-sizing, and other restructuring costs ($211&nbsp;million) and relocation costs($44&nbsp;million). Under current accounting pronouncements, these costs are notrecognized until incurred. For further details of JPMorgan Chase's merger andrestructuring costs, refer to Note 5 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q and page 44 of JPMorganChase's 2001 Annual Report.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs on an operating basis are composed of the provision for loan lossesrelated to loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to the credit costsassociated with credit card receivables that have been securitized.Credit costs in the first quarter of 2002, when compared with the first quarter of 2001, increased as a result ofhigher charge-offs in the retained portfolio and on securitized credit cards. See pages 35-38 for a discussion ofcharge-offs associated with the consumer and commercial loan portfolios and pages 34-39 for a discussion of theallowance for credit losses.INCOME TAXESJPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of $505&nbsp;million on income beforethe effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of 2002, compared with$656&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2001. The effective tax rates for theperiods were 34% and 35%, respectively.33 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RISK MANAGEMENTJPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational andbusiness, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion of these risks anddefinitions of terms associated with managing these risks, see pages45-62 and the Glossary of Terms in the 2001 Annual Report.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk profile as of March&nbsp;31,2002 focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and should beread in conjunction with pages 47-54 and 75-77 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 AnnualReport.The following table presents the Firm's credit-related information for the dates indicated.JPMorgan Chase's managed credit-related assets were $301&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31,2002, a decrease of 3% and 4% compared with December&nbsp;31, 2001 and March&nbsp;31,2001, respectively. Commercial loans decreased 3% and 10% from year-end 2001 andMarch&nbsp;31, 2001, respectively, reflecting in part the Firm's on-going disciplineof originating loans for distribution and its strategy to reduce its commercialcredit exposure. Derivative and foreign exchange instruments decreased 11% and20% compared with year-end 2001 and March&nbsp;31, 2001, respectively.Consumer managed credit-related assets increased $2.0&nbsp;billion, reflecting growthin the credit card portfolio due in large part to the Providian Master Trustacquisition, offset in part by a decline in the residential mortgage warehouseportfolio as a result of increased loan sales.34 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The portion of commercial credit-related assets considered investment grade wasapproximately 65% at March&nbsp;31, 2002, unchanged from year-end 2001. Includingunfunded commercial commitments, the portion of the portfolio consideredinvestment grade was 77%, also unchanged from year-end 2001.Total nonperforming assets were $4.31&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002, which included$1.13&nbsp;billion in Enron-related surety receivables and letter of credit.Excluding this amount, which is the subject of litigation with credit-worthyentities, nonperforming assets totaled $3.18&nbsp;billion. This compares to $2.79billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001 and $2.23&nbsp;billion as of March&nbsp;31, 2001. Theincrease in nonperforming assets from year-end was primarily related to one foreign commercialcredit.Total net charge-offs in the Firm's managed commercial and consumerportfolio were $1,074&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002, flat compared withthe fourth quarter of 2001. An increase in consumer charge-offs were offset bylower charge-offs in the commercial portfolio.COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO35 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The risk profile of the Firm's totalcommercial credit exposure at March&nbsp;31, 2002 (loans, derivativesand unfunded commitments) was 77% investment grade equivalent, unchanged from December&nbsp;31, 2001.The following table presents the Firm's credit-related information for the datesindicated.Commercial credit exposureThe following sections reflect discussions relating to the specific loancategories within the commercial portfolio:Commercial and Industrial: The domestic commercial and industrial portfoliodecreased $2.7&nbsp;billion from 2001&nbsp;year-end. Net charge-offs in the 2002 firstquarter were $191&nbsp;million, compared to $392&nbsp;million in the prior quarter.Nonperforming domestic commercial and industrial loans were $1,321&nbsp;million, anincrease of $135&nbsp;million from the 2001&nbsp;year-end. The foreign commercial andindustrial portfolio totaled $33.6&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002, relatively flatcompared to year-end 2001. Nonperforming foreign commercial and industrial loanswere $924&nbsp;million, an increase of $245&nbsp;million from year-end 2001. Netcharge-offs in the foreign commercial and industrial loan portfolio for thefirst quarter of 2002 increased to $103&nbsp;million from $38&nbsp;million in the priorquarter.Financial Institutions: Loans to financial institutions remained level during2002, when compared with year-end. Nonperforming financial institution loansdecreased from $56&nbsp;million to $29&nbsp;million.Derivative and Foreign Exchange ContractsFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized byJPMorgan Chase in connection with its trading and Assets/Liabilities (&#147;A/L&#148;)activities, see Note 15 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q, and page 51 and Note 24 of JPMorganChase's 2001 Annual Report. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at March&nbsp;31,2002 and December&nbsp;31, 2001.The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of March&nbsp;31, 2002, of the Firm's derivative and foreign exchangecontract balance sheet exposure, net of collateral held, taking into account cash and other highly liquid collateralheld by the Firm. The Firm's internal risk ratings generally represent a risk profile similar to that of the independentrating agencies; ratings are based upon the Firm's internalobligor risk ratings and presented on a Standard & Poor's-equivalent basis:36 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Country ExposureDuring the first quarter of 2002, the Firm'sexposure to Mexico increased driven by increased trading activity.Exposure to Brazil declined by about $600&nbsp;million due to reductions in deposit and counterpartyderivatives exposures. In Argentina, the Firm continues to managedown its exposure and, as of March&nbsp;31, 2002, the total exposurewas $500&nbsp;million (before loan loss allowance). In Japan, theFirm's exposure declined due to fluctuations in trading activityand other short-term positions. The following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries.This disclosure is based on management's view of country exposure. For a furtherdiscussion of the Firm's country exposure, see page 52 of the 2001 AnnualReport.CONSUMER PORTFOLIO37 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio is primarily domestic and is geographicallywell-diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled $136.0billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002, an increase of approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion since 2001year-end. Consumer net charge-offs, on a managed basis, were $754&nbsp;million and$540&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increaseis primarily due to an increase in credit card net charge-offs due, in part, toa higher level of outstandings.The following sections are discussions relating to the specific loan categorieswithin the consumer portfolio:Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $54.5&nbsp;billion atMarch&nbsp;31, 2002, a $5.0&nbsp;billion decrease from2001&nbsp;year-end. Nonperforming1-4 family residential mortgage loans increased $71&nbsp;million from year-end,primarily due to an increase in nonperforming loans in the sub-prime portion of theportfolio. The net charge-off rate of 0.09% for the first quarter of 2002 wasrelatively unchanged from first quarter 2001.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet aswell as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed credit card receivables were approximately $48.0billion for the first quarter of 2002, an increase of 18% when compared withyear-end 2001 and includes a portfolio of creditcard assets acquired from Providian in February 2002. During the 2002 firstquarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card receivablesincreased to 5.87%, compared with 5.05% in the prior-year period. Loans over 90days past due increased to 2.29% of the portfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2002, comparedwith 2.22% at December&nbsp;31, 2001. Management anticipates that the managed creditcard net charge-off ratio for the full-year 2002 will be higher thanfull-year 2001, due in part to the contribution of the Providian card portfolio.Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased slightly at March&nbsp;31,2002, when compared with year-end 2001. Although increased from the prior year,the charge-off rate of 0.58% for the 2002 first quarter continues to beindicative of this portfolio's selective approach to asset origination. Totaloriginations were $5.8&nbsp;billion for the first three months of 2002, compared with$4.3&nbsp;billion for the comparable period in 2001.Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans of $7.6&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002remained comparable with year-end levels. The net charge-off rate related tothis portfolio increased in the first quarter to 2.16% when compared with thefirst quarter of 2001, as a result of slightly higher manufactured housingcharge-offs.Allowance for Credit LossesLoans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of March&nbsp;31, 2002, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.Within the allowance, there are both specific and expected loss components and aresidual component. For a further discussion of the specific loss, expected lossand residual components of the allowance for loan losses, see page 54 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.The total specific and expected allowance for commercial loan losses was $1,798million at March&nbsp;31, 2002, an increase of $74&nbsp;million from the 2001&nbsp;year-end.The consumer expected loss component of approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion increased 20%from the 2001&nbsp;year-end reflecting the addition to the allowance relating to theProvidian portfolio.The residual component at March&nbsp;31, 2002 was $689&nbsp;million, essentially the sameas the 2001&nbsp;year-end. The residual component represented approximately 14% ofthe total allowance for loan losses.Lower credit quality for the Firm's loan portfolios are reflected in theallowance for credit losses, which was increased by $850&nbsp;million from March&nbsp;31,2001; the remaining increase in the allowance reflects the addition of theProvidian portfolio. The allowance represented 2.33% of loans at March&nbsp;31,2002, compared with 2.08% at December&nbsp;31, 2001.As of March&nbsp;31, 2002, management deemed the allowance to be adequate (i.e.,sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable).38 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Allowance ComponentsLending-Related Commitments: JPMorgan Chase also has an allowance for itsoff-balance sheet lending-related commitments, using a methodology similar to that for the loanportfolio. This allowance, which is reported in Other Liabilities, was $281million at March&nbsp;31, 2002 and $283&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2001.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTAggregate VAR ExposureJPMorgan Chase's statistical market risk measure value-at-risk (&#147;VAR&#148;), gaugesthe dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinarymarket environment. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VARcalculation that includes its trading and investment portfolios, plus all of itsmarket risk-related A/L activities.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, the following table provides a meaningfuloverview of the Firm's market risk exposure arising from trading activities and the investment and A/L portfolio.Aggregate portfolio39 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Histogram:The following histogram illustrates JPMorgan Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income, brokeragecommissions, underwriting fees or other revenue. In the first quarter 2002,JPMorgan Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 58 out of61&nbsp;days, with 42&nbsp;days exceeding positive $25&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained ononly three of the 61&nbsp;days represented in the histogram. JPMorgan Chase incurredonly one daily trading loss in excess of $20&nbsp;million in the first quarter of2002.Average daily revenue: $39.1 millionStress TestingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. For a further discussion of the Firm's stress testingmethodology, see page 56 of the 2001 Annual Report.The following table represents the potential economic value stress test loss(pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase'sstress test scenarios.Largest Monthly Stress Test Loss &#150;Pre-Tax40 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and should be read inconjunction with page 46 and Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.CapitalJPMorgan Chase's capital levels at March&nbsp;31, 2002 continued to improve withratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. At March&nbsp;31, 2002, the Tier 1and Total Capital ratios were 8.6% and 12.5%, respectively, and the Tier 1leverage ratio was 5.4%. At March&nbsp;31, 2002, the total capitalization of JPMorganChase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was $56.1&nbsp;billion, an increase of$2.0&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2001. Approximately half ofthe increase was dueto changes in Tier 1 capital, principally reflecting $0.3&nbsp;billion in retainedearnings (net income less common and preferred dividends) generated during theperiod, the issuance of $1&nbsp;billion in trust preferred securities, and the netstock issuance of $0.2&nbsp;billion, partially offset by the redemption of $550million in preferred stock of subsidiary. The remaining increase in totalcapital reflected increases in the subordinated debt and allowance forcredit losses components of Tier 2 capital. The Firm did not repurchase sharesof its common stock during the first quarter.In the first quarter of 2002, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cash dividendon its common stock of $0.34 per share payable April&nbsp;30, 2002 to stockholders ofrecord at the close of business April&nbsp;5, 2002.The following table shows JPMorgan Chase's capital generation and use during the periods indicated.Economic risk capital: JPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy by measuring risk utilizing internal risk assessmentmethodologies. The Firm quantifies credit, market and operating risk for each business and, for JPMP, privateequity risk, and assigns capital to each business accordingly. These methodologies are discussed in the risk managementsections of the 2001 Annual Report on pages 45-62. The following table presents the assessment of capital adequacy foreach risk factor as estimated by the Firm's economic capital allocation model. Restatements mayoccur in future periods to reflect refinements of economic capital methodologies.41 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer to pages58-59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and should be read inconjunction with pages 60-61 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.LiquidityDuring the first three months of 2002, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $3.5billion of long-term debt and $1&nbsp;billion of trust preferred capital securities.During the same period, $5.7&nbsp;billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed,and $550&nbsp;million of preferred stock of subsidiary was redeemed.The maturity profile of JPMorgan Chase's lending-related commitments did notchange materially from that reported at December&nbsp;31, 2001.PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity risk management, refer topage 62 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Form&nbsp;10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries, without the approval of their relevantbanking regulators, could pay dividends to their respective bank holdingcompanies in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These dividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaledapproximately $2.5&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSIn May 2002, the FASB released an exposure draft of an amendment to SFAS 133,which establishes accounting and reporting standards for all derivativeinstruments. The amendment clarifies the definition of a derivative andestablishes accounting guidance for beneficial interests in securitizedfinancial assets. The Firm is currently reviewing the exposure draft, and itsimpact is yet to be determined.42 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

Morgan Securities Inc. (&#147;JPMSI&#148;; formerly known as Chase Securities,Inc.) has been named as a defendant or third-party defendant in 16 actions thatwere filed in either the United States District Court for the Northern Districtof Oklahoma or in Oklahoma state court or New York state court beginning inOctober 1999 arising out of the failure of Commercial Financial Services, Inc.(&#147;CFS&#148;). Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchasedover $1.6&nbsp;billion in original face amount of asset-backed securities issued byCFS. The securities were backed by delinquent credit card receivables. Inaddition to JPMSI, the defendants in various of the actions are the foundersand key executives of CFS, as well as its auditors, its outside counsel and therating agencies that rated the securities. JPMSI is alleged to have been theinvestment banker to CFS and to have acted as an initial purchaser and asplacement agent in connection with the issuance of certain of the securities.Plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or were reckless in not knowingthat the securities were sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleadingmisrepresentations and omissions of material facts. The complaintsagainst JPMSI assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, theOklahoma Securities Act, and under common law theories of fraud and negligentmisrepresentation. In the actions against JPMSI, damages in the amount ofapproximately $1.2&nbsp;billion allegedly suffered as a result of defendants'misrepresentations and omissions, plus punitive damages, are being claimed.48 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in May 2001, JPMorgan Chase and certain of its securitiessubsidiaries have been named, along with numerous other firms in the securitiesindustry, as defendants in a large number of putative class action lawsuitsfiled in the United States District Court for the Southern District of NewYork. These suits purport to challenge alleged improprieties in the allocationof stock in various public offerings, including some offerings for which aJPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. The suits allege violations ofsecurities and antitrust laws arising from alleged material misstatements andomissions in registration statements and prospectuses for the initial publicofferings and with respect to aftermarket transactions in the offeredsecurities. The securities claims allege, among other things,misrepresentations concerning commissions paid to JPMorgan Chase andaftermarket transactions by customers who received allocations of shares in therespective initial public offerings. The antitrust claims allege an illegalconspiracy to require customers, in exchange for initial public offeringallocations, to pay undisclosed and excessive commissions and to makeaftermarket purchases of the initial public offering securities at a pricehigher than the offering price, as a precondition to receiving allocation.JPMorgan Chase also has received various subpoenas and informal requests fromgovernmental and other agencies seeking information relating to initial publicoffering allocation practices. Recently, JPMSIwas advised by the staff of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers (&#147;NASD&#148;) that it was considering recommending thatdisciplinary action be brought concerning activities of one of JPMSI'spredecessor entities (Hambrecht & Quist Group). JPMSI anticipates submitting tothe NASD staff this month a letter outlining the basis forJPMSI's position thatno such action is warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase continues to be involved in a number of lawsuits andinvestigations arising out of itsbanking relationships with Enron Corporation. The Firm initiated a lawsuit in NewYork in December 2001 against eleven insurance companies seeking payment underEnron-related surety bonds issued by these companies and a lawsuit in Londonagainst Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale seeking to compel payment under anEnron-related letter of credit issued by the bank. On March&nbsp;5, 2002, the courtin New York denied the Firm's motion for summary judgment against the insurancecompanies, ordered discovery, and set a trial date ofDecember&nbsp;2, 2002. JPMorgan Chase intends to pursue both litigations vigorously. Actions have alsobeen initiatedby other parties against JPMorgan Chase and its directors and certain of itsofficers. These lawsuits include a series of purported class actions brought onbehalf of shareholders of Enron, captioned Newbie v. Enron Corp., and a seriesof purported class actions brought on behalf of Enron employees, captionedTittle v. Enron Corp., both of which are pending in Houston.
