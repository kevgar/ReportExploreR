Table of ContentsThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of AFS and held-to-maturity securities were as followsfor the dates indicated.The majority of the gross unrealized losses on AFS securities at June&nbsp;30, 2008, have existed forless than 12&nbsp;months. The impairment of AFS securities is based on a variety of factors, includingthe length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the financialcondition and near-term prospects of the issuer of a security; where applicable under EITF Issue99-20, the Firm's current estimate of the cash flows over the life of the security; and the Firm'sintent and ability to retain the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fairvalue. Based on the Firm's evaluation of these factors and other objective evidence, the Firmbelieves that the securities are not other than temporarily impaired as of June&nbsp;30, 2008.Included in the $1.1&nbsp;billion of gross unrealized losses on AFS securities at June&nbsp;30, 2008 was $45million of unrealized losses that have existed for longer than 12&nbsp;months. These securities areprimarily non-U.S. government debt and asset-backed securities. The non-U.S. government debt israted AAA and consists of obligations of non-U.S. governments thatare members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (&#147;OECD&#148;). Theunrealized losses on the non-U.S.&nbsp;government debt andasset-backed securities are primarily due to overallincreases in market interest rates and spreads, respectively, and not concerns regarding the underlying credit of the issuersor the underlying collateral. In total, these securities have a fair value at June&nbsp;30, 2008, that iswithin 4% of their amortized cost basis.NOTE 12 &#150; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIESFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 onpage 136 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are generally treated as collateralized financingtransactions and carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts the securities will besubsequently sold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Securities borrowed and securities lent,also treated as collateral financing transactions, are generally recorded at the amount of cashcollateral advanced or received.On January&nbsp;1, 2007, pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 159, the Firm elected fair value measurementfor certain resale and repurchase agreements. In the second quarter of 2008, the Firm elected fairvalue measurement for certain securities borrowed and securities lending agreements. For a furtherdiscussion of SFAS 159, see Note 4 on pages 90-92 of this Form 10-Q. The securities financingagreements for which the fair value option has been elected continue to be reported withinsecurities purchased under resale agreements; securities loaned or sold under repurchaseagreements; securities borrowed; and other borrowed funds on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Generally for agreements carried at fair value,98 Table of Contentscurrent period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense withchanges in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financialinstruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordancewith SFAS 133, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported inprincipal transactions revenue.Securities financing transactions that meet the criteria within FIN 41 are reported on a net basis.The following table details the components of collateralized agreements, and collateralizedfinancings at each of the dates indicated.JPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchase agreementsand other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the securedparty are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.At June&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm received securities as collateral that could be repledged, delivered orotherwise used with a fair value of approximately $574.0&nbsp;billion. This collateral was generallyobtained under resale or securities borrowing agreements. Of these securities, approximately $463.1billion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used, generally as collateral under repurchaseagreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales.NOTE 13 &#150; LOANSThe accounting for a loan may differ based upon the type of loan and/or its use in an investing ortrading strategy. The measurement framework for loans in the consolidated financial statements isone of the following:For a detailed discussion of accounting policies relating to loans, see Note 14 on pages 137-138 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 90-92 of this Form 10-Q for furtherinformation on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under SFAS 159. See Note 5 on pages92-94 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified astrading assets.Interest income is recognized using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rateof return over the term of the loan.Loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred tothe held-for-sale portfolio. Transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fairvalue on the date of transfer. Losses attributed to credit losses are charged off to the allowancefor loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates, or exchange rates, are recognized innoninterest revenue.99 Table of ContentsLoans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to theheld-for-investment portfolio at fair value. The allowance for loanlosses for such loans is based on the Firm'sallowance methodology. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing theFirm's allowance for loans losses, see Note 15 on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.The composition of the loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was as follows.The following table reflects information about the Firm's loan sales.Impaired loansA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable thatthe Firm will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal and interest) according tothe contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include certain nonaccrual wholesaleloans and loans for which a charge-off has been recorded based on the fair value of the underlyingcollateral. Impaired loans also include loans that have been modified in troubled debtrestructurings as a concession to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Troubled debtrestructurings typically result from the Firm's loss mitigation activities and could include ratereductions, principal forgiveness forbearance,100 Table of Contentsand other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure orrepossession of collateral.The tables below set forth information about JPMorgan Chase's impaired loans, excluding creditcard loans which are discussed below. The Firm primarily uses the discounted cash flow method forvaluing impaired loans.JPMorgan Chase may modify the terms of its credit card loan agreements with borrowers who haveexperienced financial difficulty. Such modifications may include: canceling the customer'savailable line of credit on the credit card, reducing the interest rate on the card, and placingthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60&nbsp;months. If the cardholder does not complywith the modified terms, then the credit card loan agreement will revert back to its originalterms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency &#147;bucket&#148;and the loan amounts then charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.Under these programs, $1.8&nbsp;billion and $1.4&nbsp;billion of on-balance sheet credit card loanoutstandings have been modified at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. Inaccordance with the Firm's methodology for determining its consumer allowance for loan losses, theFirm had already provisioned for these credit card loans; the modifications to these credit cardloans had no incremental impact on the Firm's allowance for loan losses.101 Table of ContentsNOTE 14 &#150; ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESFor a further discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies,see Note 15 on pages 138-139 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The table below summarizesthe changes in the allowance for loan losses.NOTE 15 &#150; ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSE ANDOTHER LIABILITIESThe following table details the components of accrued interest and accounts receivable, andaccounts payable, accrued expense and other liabilities at each of the dates indicated.102 Table of ContentsNOTE 16 &#150; LOAN SECURITIZATIONSJPMorgan Chase securitizes and sells a variety of its consumer andwholesale loans, includingwarehouse loans that are classified as Trading assets. JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitizationsutilize special purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) as part of the securitization process. These SPEs arestructured to meet the definition of a qualifying special purpose entity (&#147;QSPE&#148;) (for a furtherdiscussion, see Note 1 on page 108 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report); accordingly, the assetsand liabilities of securitization-related QSPEs are not reflected in the Firm's ConsolidatedBalance Sheets (except for retained interests, as described below) but are included on the balancesheet of the QSPE purchasing the assets. The primary purpose of these vehicles is to meet investorneeds and to generate liquidity for the Firm through the sale of loans to the QSPEs.Consumer activities include securitization of credit card, residential mortgage, automobile andeducation loans that are originated or purchased by Retail Financial Services (&#147;RFS&#148;) and CardServices (&#147;CS&#148;). CS retains servicing for all its originated credit card loans. It also has anundivided interest in its credit card master trusts and other retained subordinated interests. RFSretains servicing for all of its originated and purchased mortgage, automobile andeducation loans and may retain servicing for certain mortgage loans purchased by the IB. In alimited number of securitizations, RFS may retain a residual interest.Wholesale activities include IB securitizations of purchased residential mortgage loans, certainmortgage loans originated by RFS and commercial loans (primarily real estate-related) originated bythe IB. Residential mortgages securitized by the IB are either serviced by RFS, third parties or bythe IB. The Firm does not service commercial mortgage loans. The IB may retain a residual interestin residential mortgage and non-mortgage consumer loans. The IB does not generally retain aresidual interest in the Firm's sponsored commercial mortgage securitizations.Seepages 106-107 of this Form 10-Q for further details on the Firm's retained interests in securitized loans.Assets held by JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization-related QSPEs as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2007, were as follows.Total assets in the above table includes securitized loans where the Firm has no continuinginvolvement, predominantly commercial mortgages, as well as securitized loans where the Firm's onlycontinuing involvement is servicing the loans. The table also includes securitized loans where theFirm owns less than a majority of the subordinated or residual interests in the securitizations.See pages 106-107 for further details on the Firm's retained interests in securitized loans.103 Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize new securitization transactions that were completed during the threeand six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007; the resulting gains arising from such securitizations;certain cash flows received from such securitizations; and the key economic assumptions used inmeasuring the retained interests (if any) other than residential MSRs (for a discussion ofresidential MSRs, see Note 18 on pages 114-115 of this Form 10-Q) as of the dates of such sales.104 Table of ContentsIn addition to the amounts reported for securitization activity in the preceding tables, the Firmsold residential mortgage loans totaling $39.4&nbsp;billion and $18.7&nbsp;billion during the three monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily for securitization by the Government NationalMortgage Association (&#147;GNMA&#148;), Federal National Mortgage Association (&#147;FNMA&#148;) and Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation (&#147;Freddie Mac&#148;); these sales resultedin pretax gains of $36&nbsp;million and $3&nbsp;million, respectively. During the first six months of 2008 and 2007, JPMorgan Chase soldresidential mortgage loans totaling $69.1&nbsp;billion and $35.8&nbsp;billion, respectively, primarily forsecuritization by the GNMA, FNMA, and Freddie Mac; these salesresulted in pretax gains of $26&nbsp;million and $87&nbsp;million, respectively.Retained servicingJPMorgan Chase retains servicing responsibilities for all originated, and certain purchased,residential mortgage, credit card, education and automobile loan securitizations and for certaincommercial activity securitizations it sponsors, and receives servicing fees based upon thesecuritized loan balance plus certain ancillary fees. The Firm also retains the right to servicethe residential mortgage loans it sells to GNMA, FNMA and Freddie Mac. For a discussion of mortgageservicing rights, see Note 18 on pages 114-115 of this Form 10-Q.The Firm provides mortgage servicing on a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing,the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e.,normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk withthe owner of the mortgage loans, such as FNMA or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer orguarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of theproperty underlying a defaulted mortgage are less than the outstanding principal balance andaccrued interest of the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. TheFirm's mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferringthe risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the securities issued by the trust. As of June30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, the amount of recourseobligations totaled $518&nbsp;million and $557&nbsp;million, respectively.105 Table of ContentsRetained securitization interestsAt June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Firm had, with respect to its credit card mastertrusts, $19.0&nbsp;billion and $18.6&nbsp;billion, respectively, related to undivided interests, and $3.0billion and $2.7&nbsp;billion, respectively, related to subordinated interests in accrued interest andfees on the securitized receivables, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. Credit cardsecuritization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest of 4% to 12% of theprincipal receivables in the trusts. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principalreceivables in the trusts of approximately 20% for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, and 19% forthe year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.The Firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined limits for some credit card, automobileand education securitizations to cover the unlikely event of deficiencies in cash flows owed toinvestors. The amounts available in such escrow accounts are recorded in other assets and, as ofJune&nbsp;30, 2008, amounted to $78&nbsp;million, $9&nbsp;million and $3&nbsp;million for credit card, automobile andeducation securitizations, respectively; as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, these amounts were $97&nbsp;million,$21&nbsp;million and $3&nbsp;million for credit card, automobile and education securitizations, respectively.The following table summarizes other retained securitization interests, which are primarilysubordinated or residual interests, and are carried at fair value on the Firm's ConsolidatedBalance Sheets.106 Table of ContentsThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's retained interests other than residential MSRs (for a discussion of residential MSRs, seeNote 18 on pages 114-115 of this Form 10-Q) in its securitization trusts at June&nbsp;30, 2008, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively; in addition, it outlines the sensitivities of those fair values toimmediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based upon a10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities.107 Table of ContentsThe table below presents information about delinquencies, net charge-offs (recoveries)&nbsp;andcomponents of reported and securitized financial assets at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.Subprime adjustable-rate mortgage loan modificationsIn December&nbsp;2007, the American Securitization Forum (&#147;ASF&#148;) issued the &#147;Streamlined Foreclosure andLoss Avoidance Framework for Securitized Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans&#148; (the&#147;Framework&#148;). For a further discussion of the ASF Framework, see Note 16 on page 145 of JPMorganChase's 2007 Annual Report.JPMorgan Chase has adopted the loss mitigation approaches under the Framework for securitizedsubprime mortgage loans that meet the specific Segment 2 screening criteria, and began modifyingSegment 2 loans during the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of the Framework did notaffect the off-balance sheet accounting treatment of JPMorgan Chase-sponsored QSPEs that holdSegment 2 subprime loans.108 Table of ContentsThe total amount of assets owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs that hold ASF Framework Loans (includingthose loans that are not serviced by the Firm) as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, were$32.4&nbsp;billion and $20.0&nbsp;billion, respectively. Of theseamounts, $13.0&nbsp;billion and $9.7&nbsp;billion,respectively, are related to ASF Framework Loans serviced by the Firm.At June&nbsp;30, 2008, approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion (or 12%),$2.3&nbsp;billion (or 18%) and $9.1&nbsp;billion (or 70%) of the ASF Framework Loans the Firm services that are owned by Firm-sponsoredQSPEs fell within Segments 1, 2 and 3, respectively. AtDecember&nbsp;31, 2007, 20%, 10% and 70% of ASF Framework Loans theFirm services that are owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs fell withinSegments&nbsp;1, 2 and 3, respectively. Theestimates of segmentclassification could change substantially as a result of unanticipated changes in housing values,economic conditions, borrower/investor behavior and other factors. Included within the assets ownedby the Firm-sponsored QSPEs was repossessed real estate owned, for which JPMorgan Chase is theservicer, in the amount of $1.9&nbsp;billion and $637&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,respectively. The growth in real estate owned in the second quarterof 2008 is attributable tothe Bear Stearns merger and increased foreclosures resulting from current housing market conditions.The total principal amount of beneficial interests issued by Firm-sponsored securitizations thathold ASF Framework Loans as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, were as follows.For those ASF Framework Loans serviced by the Firm and owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs, the Firmmodified $649&nbsp;million and $836&nbsp;million, respectively, of Segment 2 subprime mortgages during thethree and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008. For Segment 3 loans, an appropriate loss mitigationapproach that is intended to maximize the recoveries to the securitization trust is chosen withoutemploying the fast track modifications prescribed for Segment 2 subprime mortgages. The lossmitigation approach chosen by JPMorgan Chase is consistent with the applicable servicingagreements, and could include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance andother actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoidforeclosure. During the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30,2008, $483&nbsp;million and $524&nbsp;million, respectively, ofSegment&nbsp;3 loans were modified, $302&nbsp;million and$377&nbsp;million, respectively, were subjected to other lossmitigation activities, and $43&nbsp;million and $76&nbsp;million,respectively, were prepaid by borrowers. The impact of loss mitigation efforts on the fair value ofthe Firm's retained interests in ASF Framework loans was not material at June&nbsp;30, 2008.NOTE17 &#150; VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESRefer to Note 1 on page 108 and Note 17 on page 146 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report for afurther description of JPMorgan Chase's policies regarding consolidation of variable interestentities and the Firm's principal involvement with variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;).Multi-seller conduitsThe following table summarizes the Firm's involvement with nonconsolidated Firm-administered,multi-seller conduits. There were no consolidated Firm-administered, multi-seller conduits as ofJune&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.109 Table of ContentsAssets funded by the multi-seller conduitsJPMorgan Chase's administered multi-seller conduits fund a variety of asset types for the Firm'sclients. Asset types primarily include credit card receivables, auto loans and leases, tradereceivables, education loans, commercial loans, residential mortgages, capital commitments (e.g.,loans to private equity, mezzanine and real estate opportunity funds secured by capital commitmentsof highly rated institutional investors), and various other asset types. It is the Firm's intentionthat the assets funded by its administered multi-seller conduits be sourced only from the Firm'sclients and not be originated by or transferred from JPMorgan Chase.The following table presents information on the commitments and assets held by JPMorgan Chase'sadministered multi-seller conduits as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.Summary of exposure to Firm-administered, nonconsolidated multi-seller conduits110 Table of ContentsThe assets held by the multi-seller conduits are structured so that if they were rated, the Firmbelieves the majority of them would receive an &#147;A&#148; rating or better by external rating agencies.However, it is unusual for the assets held by the conduits to be explicitly rated by an externalrating agency. Instead, the Firm's Credit Risk group assigns each asset purchase liquidity facilityan internal risk-rating based on its assessment of the probability of default for the transaction.The ratings provided in the above table reflect the S&P-equivalent ratings of the internal ratinggrades assigned by the Firm.The risk ratings are periodically reassessed as information becomes available. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008,91% of the assets in the conduits were risk rated &#147;A&#148; or better.Commercial paper issued by the multi-seller conduitsThe weighted average life of commercial paper issued by the multi-seller conduits was 25&nbsp;days atJune&nbsp;30, 2008, compared with 21&nbsp;days at December&nbsp;31, 2007, and the average yield on the commercialpaper was 2.6% at June&nbsp;30, 2008, compared with 5.7% at December&nbsp;31, 2007.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase trades and invests in commercial paper, includingpaper issued by the Firm-administered conduits. The percentage of commercial paper purchased by theFirm across all Firm-administered conduits during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, ranged fromless than 1% to 3.2% on any given day. The largest daily amount held by the Firm in any onemulti-seller conduit during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, was approximately $949&nbsp;million, or7.1%, of the conduit's commercial paper outstanding. Total commercial paper held by the Firm atJune&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, was $693&nbsp;million and $131&nbsp;million, respectively. The Firm isnot obligated under any agreement (contractual or noncontractual) to purchase the commercial paperissued by JPMorgan Chase-administered conduits.Consolidated sensitivity analysis on capitalIt is possible that the Firm could be required to consolidate a VIE if it were determined that theFirm became the primary beneficiary of the VIE under the provisions of FIN 46R. The factorsinvolved in making the determination of whether or not a VIE should be consolidated are discussedabove and in Note 1 on page 108 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.The table below shows the impact on the Firm's reported assets, liabilities, net income, Tier 1capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio if the Firm were required to consolidate all of themulti-seller conduits that it administers.The Firm could fund purchases of assets from VIEs should it become necessary.Investor intermediationMunicipal bond vehiclesExposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, includingthe ratings profile of the VIE's assets, were as follows.111 Table of ContentsAt June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively, the Firm held $538&nbsp;million and $617&nbsp;millionof putable floating-rate certificates on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The largest amount heldby the Firm at any time during the first half of 2008 was $2.2&nbsp;billion, or 11.3%, of the municipalbond vehicles' outstanding putable floating-rate certificates.At June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, 98% and 99%, respectively, of the municipal bonds held byvehicles to which the Firm served as liquidity provider were rated &#147;AA-&#148; or better, based on eitherthe rating of the underlying municipal bond itself, or the rating including any credit enhancement.At June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, $5.6&nbsp;billion and $12.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, of the bondswere insured by monoline bond insurers. During the first half of 2008 andfull-year 2007, the Firm did not experience a draw on the liquidityfacilities. In addition, the municipalbond vehicles did not experience any bankruptcy or downgradetermination events during the first half of 2008 and full-year 2007.The Firm sometimes invests in the residual interests of municipal bond vehicles. For VIEs in whichthe Firm owns the residual interests, the Firm consolidates the VIEs. The likelihood that the Firmwould have to consolidate VIEs where the Firm does not own the residual interests and that arecurrently off-balance sheet is remote.Credit-linked note vehiclesExposure to nonconsolidated credit-linked note VIEs at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, was asfollows.112 Table of ContentsCollateralized Debt Obligations vehiclesExposures to collateralized debt obligation (&#147;CDO&#148;) warehouse VIEs at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December31, 2007, were as follows.Inaddition to the CDO warehouse exposure noted above, at June&nbsp;30,2008, $278&nbsp;million of assets of CDO vehicles were consolidatedby the Firm due to the Firm owning a majority of the equity interestin the vehicles. The Firm also owned less than majority equityinterests in several CDO vehicles for which the Firm was not theprimary beneficiary and, therefore, the Firm did not consolidate theentities. The fair value of these interests was $22&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2008. These nonconsolidated CDO vehicles had totalassets of approximately $4.6&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2008, allof which were noninvestment-grade.Consolidated VIE assetsThe following table summarizes the Firm's total consolidated VIE assets, by classification, on theConsolidated Balance Sheets, as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified inthe line item titled, &#147;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities&#148; onthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse tothe general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 21 on page 159 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport for the maturity profile of FIN 46 long-term beneficial interests.113 Table of ContentsOther significant interests in VIEsIn conjunction with the Merger, in June&nbsp;2008, the FRBNY took control, through an LLC formed forthis purpose, of a portfolio of $30&nbsp;billion in assets, based on the value of the portfolio as ofMarch&nbsp;14, 2008. The assets of the LLC were funded by a $28.85&nbsp;billion, term loan from the FRBNY,and a $1.15&nbsp;billion, subordinated note from JPMorgan Chase. The JPMorgan Chase note is subordinatedto the FRBNY loan and will bear the first $1.15&nbsp;billion of any losses of the portfolio. Anyremaining assets in the portfolio after repayment of the FRBNY loan, the JPMorgan Chase note andthe expense of the LLC, will be for the account of the FRBNY.NOTE18 &#150; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS For a discussion of accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note18 on pages 154-157 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillThe $723&nbsp;million increase in goodwill from December&nbsp;31, 2007, largely resulted from the purchase ofan additional equity interest in Highbridge, tax-related purchase accounting adjustments associatedwith the Bank One merger and the merger with Bear Stearns. For additional information, see Note 2on pages 80-83 of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill was not impaired at June&nbsp;30, 2008, or December&nbsp;31, 2007, nor was any goodwill written offdue to impairment during either the six month period ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 or 2007.Goodwill attributed to the business segments was as follows.Mortgage servicing rightsFor a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and valuationmethodology of MSRs, see Notes 4 and 18 on pages 113 and 154-157 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport, respectively. The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, includingtheir effect on prepayment speeds. JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of derivatives and tradinginstruments to manage changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in thefair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. MSRsdecrease in value when interest rates decline. Conversely, securities (such as mortgage-backedsecurities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (when the Firm receives fixed-rateinterest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline.114 Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize MSR activity for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and2007.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's MSRs at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively; and it outlines thesensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution.Changes in fair value based upon a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be easilyextrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair valuemay not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption mayhave on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes inone factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.Purchased credit card relationships and all other intangible assetsFor the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008, purchased credit card relationships, other creditcard-related intangibles and core deposit intangibles decreased $577&nbsp;million, primarily as a resultof amortization expense.

The following table is a summary oflong-term debt carrying values (including unamortized original issue discount, SFAS 133 valuationadjustments and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by contractual maturity for the currentyear.117 Table of ContentsThe weighted-average contractual interest rate for total long-term debt was 4.54% and 5.20% as ofJune&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest rateand currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarilyinterest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues.The use of these instruments modifies the Firm's interest expense on the associated debt. Themodified weighted-average interest rate for total long-term debt, including the effects of relatedderivative instruments, was 4.06% and 5.13% as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,respectively.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Parent Company) has guaranteed certain debt of its subsidiaries, includingboth long-term debt and structured notes sold as part of the Firm's trading activities. Theseguarantees rank on a parity with all of the Firm's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.Guaranteed liabilities totaled $41.3 billion and $46&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,respectively. The increase in guarantees relates to the Bear Stearnsmerger. For additional information, see Note 2 on pages&nbsp;80-83 of thisForm 10-Q.Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capitaldebt securitiesAt June&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm had established 24 wholly owned Delaware statutory business trusts(&#147;issuer trusts&#148;) that had issued guaranteed capital debt securities.The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Firm to the issuer trusts,totaling $17.3&nbsp;billion and $15.1&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively,were reflected in the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets in the liabilities section under thecaption &#147;Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteedcapital debt securities&#148; (i.e., trust preferred capital debt securities). The Firm also records thecommon capital securities issued by the issuer trusts in other assets in its Consolidated BalanceSheets at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.The debentures issued to the issuer trusts by the Firm, less the common capital securities of theissuer trusts, qualify as Tier 1 capital. The following is a summary of the outstanding trustpreferred capital debt securities, including unamortized original issue discount, issued by eachtrust and the junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture issued to each trust as of June&nbsp;30,2008.118 Table of ContentsNOTE21 &#150; PREFERRED STOCKJPMorgan Chase is authorized to issue 200&nbsp;million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series,with a par value of $1 per share. On April&nbsp;23, 2008, the Firm issued 600,000 shares of Fixed toFloating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;I (&#147;Series&nbsp;I&#148;).Dividends on the Series&nbsp;I shares of preferred stock will accrue at a fixed rate of 7.9% payablesemiannually through April&nbsp;2018 and then adjust to a three-month LIBOR plus 3.47%, thereafter, andare payable quarterly. The preferred stock outstanding takes precedence over JPMorgan Chase'scommon stock for the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of aliquidation or dissolution of the Firm.The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase's preferred stock outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2008.(a)&nbsp;Represented by depositary shares.(b)&nbsp;Redemptionprice includes amount shown in the table plus any accrued but unpaid dividends.Preferred stock of subsidiaryAt the time of the Merger, Bear Stearns had three series of preferred stockissued and outstanding. On June&nbsp;30, 2008, JPMorgan Chase fully and unconditionally guaranteed BearStearns' payment obligations under the terms of the Bear Stearns preferred stock. The BearStearns preferred stock has a preference over the Bear Stearns common stock in the payment ofdividends and in the liquidation of assets.The following is a summary of Bear Stearns' preferred stock outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2008. Thepreferred stock represents a minority interest and was reported in accounts payable, accrued expenseand other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.On July&nbsp;15, 2008, each series of Bear Stearns' preferred stock was exchanged into a series ofJPMorgan Chase preferred stock having substantially identical terms. As a result of the exchangeinto JPMorgan Chase preferred stock, these series of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock rank para passuwith the Series&nbsp;I preferred stock and take precedence over JPMorgan Chase's common stock for thepayment of dividends and in the liquidation of assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolutionof the Firm.119 Table of ContentsNOTE22 &#150; EARNINGS PER SHAREFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;), see Note24 on page 161 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The following table presents thecalculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007.NOTE 23 &#150; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;includes the after-tax change in SFAS 115unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, SFAS 52 foreign currency translation adjustments(including the impact of related derivatives), SFAS 133 cash flow hedging activities and SFAS158 net loss and prior service cost (credit)&nbsp;related to the Firm's defined benefit pension andOPEB plans.120 Table of ContentsNOTE 24 &#150; INCOME TAXESFor a discussion of income taxes, see Note 26 on pages 164-165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport.JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits, the amount that would reduce the effective tax rate, ifrecognized, and related accrued interest expense and penalties were as follows at June&nbsp;30, 2008,and December&nbsp;31, 2007.The increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would reduce the effective tax rate,if recognized, resulted predominantly from the Merger. The increase in accrued incometax-related interest and penalties reflects the Bear Stearns merger and the continuing outstandingstatus of JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit bya number of tax authorities, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits couldsignificantly change over the next 12&nbsp;months, which could also significantly impact JPMorganChase's quarterly and annual effective tax rates.The Firm's income before income tax expense, income tax expense and effective tax rate were asfollows for each of the periods indicated.The decrease in the effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2008,compared with the same periods for 2007, was the result of lower reported pretax income combinedwith an increased proportion of income that was not subject to U.S. federal income taxes, and abenefit from the release of deferred tax liabilities associated with earnings of certain non-U.S.subsidiaries that were deemed to be reinvested indefinitely. These benefits were partially offsetby losses representing the Firm's 49.4% ownership in Bear Stearns' losses from April 8 to May&nbsp;30,2008, for which no income tax benefit was recorded.NOTE 25 &#150; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFor a discussion of the Firm's potential liability related to The Bank of New York MellonCorporation's (&#147;BNYM&#148;) difficulties in locating certain documentation, including IRS Forms W-8 andW-9, related to certain accounts transferred to BNYM in connection with the Firm's sale of itscorporate trust business, see Note 29 on page 167 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.121 Table of ContentsLitigation reserveThe Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. In accordancewith the provisions of SFAS 5, JPMorgan Chase accrues for a litigation-related liability when it isprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated. When the Firm is named a defendant in litigation and may be subject to joint and severalliability and a judgment sharing agreement is in place, the Firm recognizes expense and obligationsnet of amounts expected to be paid by other signatories to the judgment sharing agreement.While the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in light of allinformation known to itat June&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm's litigation reserves were adequate at such date. Management reviewslitigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increased or decreased in the future toreflect further relevant developments. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to claimsasserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and, with respect to such litigation,intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according tomanagement's judgment as to what is in the best interests of stockholders.NOTE 26 &#150; ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESThe majority of JPMorgan Chase's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes. Derivativesare also utilized by the Firm as an end-user to hedge market exposures, to modify the interestrate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments or to meet longer-term investmentobjectives. Both trading and end-user derivatives are recorded in trading assets and tradingliabilities. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regardingderivative instruments, see Note 30 on pages 168-169 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. Thefollowing table presents derivative instrument hedging-related activities for the periodsindicated.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, it is expected that $293&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recorded inother comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;at June&nbsp;30, 2008, will be recognized in earnings. The maximumlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and such transactionsprimarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.NOTE 27 &#150; OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEESFor a discussion of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, and theFirm's related accounting policies, see Note 31 on pages 170-173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, an allowance forcredit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on page 102 of this Form10-Q for a further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments.122 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts of off-balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments and guarantees and the related allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guaranteesIncluded in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to investment andnoninvestment grade counterparties in connection with leveraged acquisitions. These commitments aredependent on whether the acquisition by the borrower is successful, tend to be short-term in natureand, in most cases, are subject to certain conditions based on the borrower's financial conditionor other factors. Additionally, the Firm often syndicates portions of the commitment to otherinvestors, depending on market conditions. These commitments often contain flexible pricingfeatures to adjust for changing market conditions prior to closing. Alternatively, the borrower mayturn to the capital markets for required funding instead of drawing on the commitment provided bythe Firm, and the commitment may expire unused. As such, these commitments are not necessarilyindicative of the Firm's actual risk and the total commitment amount may not reflect actual futurecash flow requirements. The amount of commitments related to leveraged acquisitions at June&nbsp;30,2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, were $7.2&nbsp;billion and $8.2&nbsp;billion, respectively.For a further discussion of the off-balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considersto be guarantees under FIN 45, and the related accounting policies, see Note 31 on pages 170-173 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The amount of the liability related to FIN 45 guaranteesrecorded at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, excluding the allowance for credit losses onlending-related commitments and derivative contracts discussed below was $382&nbsp;million and $335million, respectively.123 Table of ContentsIn addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which theFirm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. For a discussionof the derivatives the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, seeNote 31 on pages 170-173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The total notional value of thederivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $103.8&nbsp;billion and $85.3&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30,2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. The fair value related to these contracts was aderivative receivable of $184&nbsp;million and $213&nbsp;million, and a derivative payable of $5.9&nbsp;billionand $2.5&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.Residual value guaranteeIn connection with the Merger, the Firm succeeded to an operatinglease arrangement for the building located at 383 Madison Avenue in New York City (the &#147;Synthetic Lease&#148;). Underthe terms of the Synthetic Lease, the Firm is obligated to makeperiodic payments based on thelessor's underlying interest costs. The Synthetic Lease expireson November&nbsp;1, 2010. Under the terms of the Synthetic Lease, the Firm has the right to purchase the building for the amount of thethen outstanding indebtedness of the lessor or to arrange for thesale of the building with theproceeds of the sale to be used to satisfy the lessor's debt obligation. If the sale does not generate sufficient proceeds to satisfy the lessor's debt obligation, the Firm isrequired to fund the shortfall up to a maximum residual value guarantee. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, therewas no expected shortfall and the maximum residual value guaranteewas approximately $670&nbsp;million.Under a separate ground lease, the land on which the building isbuilt was leased to an affiliateof Bear Stearns which, as part of the Synthetic Lease, assigned this position to the SyntheticLease lessor. The owner of the land has sued the Firm alleging that certain provisions of themerger agreement violated a &#147;right of first offer&#148;provision of the ground lease.The Firm has moved todismiss the lawsuit on various grounds, including that the right offirst offer provision is inapplicable to the Merger.NOTE 28 &#150; BUSINESS SEGMENTSJPMorgan Chase is organized into six major reportable business segments &#151; Investment Bank, RetailFinancial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking (&#147;CB&#148;), Treasury & Securities Services(&#147;TSS&#148;) and Asset Management (&#147;AM&#148;), as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment.

The impact of credit card securitizationadjustments have been included in reconciling items so that the total Firm results are on areported basis. Finally, total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for eachof the segments is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exemptsecurities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the managed results on a basiscomparable to taxable securities and investments. This approach allows management to assess thecomparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding incometax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense (benefit).

These statements canbe identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148;&#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;goal,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statementsprovide JPMorgan Chase's current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, resultsor aspirations. JPMorgan Chase's disclosures in this report contain forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may makeforward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnishedwith the SEC. In addition, the Firm's senior management may make forward-lookingstatements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many ofwhich are beyond the Firm's control. JPMorgan Chase's actual future results may differ materiallyfrom those set forth in its forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any listof risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could causeactual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements.135 Table of ContentsAny forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they aremade and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect theimpact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firmmay make in any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or CurrentReports on Form 8-K.Item&nbsp;3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the MarketRisk Management section of the MD&A on pages 69&#150;72 of this Form 10-Q.Item&nbsp;4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under thesupervision and with the participation of the Firm's management, including its Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based uponthat evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concludedthat these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for theCertification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief FinancialOfficer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting.Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting maynot prevent or detect misstatements.There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the second quarter of2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm'sinternal control over financial reporting.Part&nbsp;II Other InformationItem&nbsp;1 Legal ProceedingsThe following information supplements and amends the disclosure set forth under Part&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;3&#147;Legal Proceedings in the Firm's 2007 Annual Report onForm&nbsp;10-K, and Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; in theFirm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March&nbsp;31, 2008 (the &#147;Firm'sSEC filings&#148;).Enron Litigation. Oral argument of plaintiffs' appeal of the District Court's dismissal of theshareholder derivative action filed against current and former directors of JPMorgan Chase isscheduled for September&nbsp;19, 2008 in front of the United States Court of Appeals for the SecondCircuit. Oral argument of plaintiffs' appeal of the District Court's dismissal of the putativeclass action on behalf of JPMorgan Chase employees who participated in the Firm's 401(k) plan,alleging claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) against the Firm, itsdirectors and named officers, is scheduled for the week of September&nbsp;22, 2008 in front of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.IPO Allocation Litigation. With respect to the IPO securities cases, on April&nbsp;9, 2008, UnderwriterDefendants moved for partial reconsideration of the District Court's Opinion and Order dated March26, 2008, in which the District Court granted in part and denied in part the UnderwriterDefendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Master Allegations and the second amended class actioncomplaints filed in the six class certification &#147;focus&#148; cases. On June&nbsp;5, 2008, the District136 Table of ContentsCourt granted the Underwriter Defendants' motion for reconsideration and dismissed with prejudiceas untimely the claims brought under Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Act of 1933 by a newly-addedfocus case plaintiff. With respect to the cases filed by plaintiff Vanessa Simmonds in the UnitedStates District Court for the Western District of Washington (the &#147;Simmonds cases&#148;), a statusconference was held on April&nbsp;28, 2008 in which the Court set a briefing schedule for defendants'motion to dismiss and granted a stay of discovery while the motions to dismiss are pending. BearStearns & Co. is also named as a defendant in 95 of the pending IPO securities cases and in four ofthe Simmonds cases.In re JPMorgan Chase Cash Balance Litigation. On July&nbsp;9, 2008, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Second Circuit decided the Hirt case and held that cash balance plans are not inherentlyage discriminatory. This decision rejects the theory on which plaintiffs' principal claim in thelitigation involving the Firm is based, and the Firm believes should result in the dismissal ofthat claim. The parties have requested, and the court has scheduled, a telephonic conference onAugust&nbsp;20, 2008 to discuss further proceedings in light of the Hirt decision, including theplaintiffs' other claims that were not addressed by the Hirt decision. Defendants have alsoprovided notice of the Hirt decision to the judge who is presiding over the Bilello action, arguingthat the decision in Hirt and a related summary order in that case relating to statute oflimitations issues provide further support for the defendants' pending motion to dismiss.Interchange Litigation. As previously disclosed, on February&nbsp;12, 2008, the magistrate judge issueda report and recommendation denying the defendants' motion to dismiss a supplemental complaintchallenging MasterCard's initial public offering, alleging that the offering violates Section&nbsp;7 ofthe Clayton Act and that the offering was a fraudulent conveyance. On April&nbsp;4, 2008, the defendantsserved and filed with the court their objections to the magistrate's report and recommendation. Thecourt has not yet issued a ruling with respect to the defendants' objections.GIC Investigation and Litigation. Bear Stearns is also involved in the previously reportedinvestigations by the New York field office of the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division andthe Philadelphia Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission of possible antitrustand securities violations in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteed investment contractsand derivatives to municipal issuers. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations.Similarly, Bear Stearns is one of the many companies, in addition to JPMorgan Chase, that have beennamed as a defendant in the several putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts in theSouthern District of New York, the District of Columbia, the Northern District of California andthe Eastern District of California for alleged antitrust violations in connection with the biddingor sale of guaranteed investment contracts and other derivatives to municipal issuers. On June&nbsp;16,2008, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the cases then before it transferredto the Southern District of New York for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings, and itis anticipated that later-filed federal cases will likewise be transferred. In addition, both BearStearns and the Firm were two of many companies that have been named as defendants in actionsbrought by the City of Los Angeles and the City of Stockton in the state courts of Californiaalleging violations of California law in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteedinvestment contracts and derivatives.Auction Rate Securities Investigation and Litigation. Several regulatory authorities haveinitiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerningpossible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction ratesecurities. The market for many such securities has frozen and a significant number of auctions forthose securities began to fail in February&nbsp;2008. On August&nbsp;7, 2008, regulators announced, withrespect to another industry participant, the institution and settlement of enforcement proceedingsrequiring that firm to, among other things, offer to purchase at par all of the auction ratesecurities that firm sold to its retail customers prior to February&nbsp;12, 2008, in which the auctionsare currently failing. Also on August&nbsp;7, 2008, another industry participant announced itsintention to offer to purchase at par the auction rate securities it sold to its retail customers.The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the AttorneyGeneral of the State of New York, the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation and theMassachusetts Attorney General have all requested information from the Firm regarding theactivities of Firm affiliates with respect to auction rate securities. The Firm is cooperating withthe investigations. Additionally, the Firm is the subject of two putative securities class actionsin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and a number ofindividual arbitrations and lawsuits relating to the Firm's sales of auction rate securities. TheFirm believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations regarding its sales of auction ratesecurities. The Firm estimates that, as of this date, its customers hold approximately $5&nbsp;billionpar amount of auction rate securities (of which approximately $3&nbsp;billion is held by retailcustomers), purchased prior to February&nbsp;2008 in which the auctions are currently failing.Bear Stearns Merger Litigation. The defendants' motion for summary judgment is now scheduled to beargued in August&nbsp;2008.Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters. Various shareholders of Bear Stearns havecommenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its current and formerofficers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stockof Bear Stearns between December&nbsp;14, 2006 and March&nbsp;14, 2008 (the &#147;Class&nbsp;Period&#148;). Five actions,commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, allege thatdefendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding the Bear Stearns' businessand financial results and that as a result of those false statements, Bear Stearns' common stocktraded at artificially inflated prices during the Class&nbsp;Period. In connection with theseallegations, the complaints assert claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. Separately, several individual shareholders of Bear Stearns havecommenced arbitration proceedings and lawsuits asserting claims similar to those in the putativeclass actions.137 Table of ContentsIn addition, Bear Stearns and certain of its current and former officers and/or directors have alsobeen named as defendants in a number of putative class actions commenced in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York purporting to represent the interests ofparticipants in the Bear Stearns Employee Stock Ownership Plan (&#147;ESOP&#148;) during the time period ofDecember&nbsp;2006 through the present (the &#147;Class&nbsp;Period&#148;). These actions allege defendants breachedtheir fiduciary duties to plaintiffs and to the other participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP by(a)&nbsp;failing to prudently manage the ESOP's investment in Bear Stearns securities; (b)&nbsp;failing tocommunicate fully and accurately about the risks of the ESOP's investment in Bear Stearns stock;(c)&nbsp;failing to avoid or address alleged conflicts of interest; and (d)&nbsp;failing to monitorthose who managed and administered the ESOP. In connection with these allegations each plaintiffasserts claims for violations under various sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act(&#147;ERISA&#148;) and seeks reimbursement to the ESOP for all losses, an unspecified amount of monetarydamages and imposition of a constructive trust.Furthermore, former directors of Bear Stearns' Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns'former executive officers have been named as defendants in two purported shareholder derivativesuits, each of which was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District ofNew York. Bear Stearns was named as a nominal defendant in both actions. By court order datedFebruary&nbsp;14, 2008, the actions were consolidated. A consolidated amended complaint was filed onMarch&nbsp;3, 2008, asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securitieslaws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control andindemnification and contribution, in connection with the losses sustained by Bear Stearns as aresult of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common shares. Certainindividual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of the Bear Stearns' commonshares while in possession of material non-public information. The amended complaint seekscompensatory damages in an unspecified amount and an order directing Bear Stearns to improve itscorporate governance procedures.Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters. Bear Stearns, certain of its subsidiaries, including Bear StearnsAsset Management, Inc. (&#147;BSAM&#148;) and Bear Stearns & Co., and certain current or former employees havebeen named as defendants (&#147;Bear Stearns defendants&#148;) in a number of actions relating to the BearStearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the &#147;High Grade Fund&#148;) and theBear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the&#147;Enhanced Leverage Fund&#148;) (collectively, the &#147;Funds&#148;). BSAM served as investment manager for bothof the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands &#147;feeder funds&#148; thatinvested substantially all their assets, directly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are inliquidation.Bear Stearns defendants have been named in four actions pending in United States District Court forthe Southern District of New York. The Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feederfunds have filed a complaint asserting claims for, among other things, fraud, breach of fiduciaryduty, breach of contract, recklessness, gross negligence, negligence, and unjust enrichment. Alsojoining the Liquidators as plaintiffs are two purported investors in the U.S. feeder funds. Inaddition to individual claims, these two plaintiffs purport to assert derivative actions with theU.S. feeder funds as nominal defendants. The plaintiffs in this case seek damages of not less than$1.5&nbsp;billion, unspecified punitive damages, costs, and fees. Two purported class action lawsuitshave been filed on behalf of purchasers of partnership interests in the High Grade and EnhancedLeverage U.S. feeder funds, respectively. In each action, the plaintiff has asserted claims for,among other things, breach of fiduciary duty. The class action complaints also purport to assertderivative actions with the High Grade and Enhanced Leverage U.S. feeder funds as nominaldefendants. The relief being sought by these plaintiffs is unspecified damages, costs and fees.Finally, in connection with its investment and other transactions related to the Enhanced LeverageFund, Barclays Bank has brought an action asserting claims for, among other things, fraud,fraudulent concealment, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation. The relief beingsought by Barclays is unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and fees.In addition, one or more Bear Stearns defendants have been named as parties in multiple FINRAarbitrations as well as in one state court action initiated by investors in the feeder funds. Therelief being sought by the claimants in these matters is compensatory damages, unspecified punitivedamages, costs and expense.BSAM and its affiliates have also been contacted by, and have received requests for information anddocuments from, various federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities as part oftheir investigations regarding the Funds, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, theUnited States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Securities Division ofthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the &#147;Securities Division&#148;). On November&nbsp;14, 2007, the SecuritiesDivision filed an administrative complaint against BSAM alleging that BSAM violated multipleprovisions of the Massachusetts Securities Act by failing to adequately disclose and/or manageconflicts of interest related to procedures for related party transactions. BSAM has filed ananswer denying liability for the claims asserted.138 Table of ContentsIn addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations discussed above, JPMorgan Chaseand its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a number of other legalactions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses. Additionalactions, investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. In view ofthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where theclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legaltheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannotstate with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timingof the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties orimpact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its currentknowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigationreserves, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pendingagainst it should not have a material, adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition ofthe Firm. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions andinvestigations, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will notsignificantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of aparticular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period,depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level ofJPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion ofcertain risk factors affecting the Firm, see Part&nbsp;I, Item 1A:Risk Factors, on pages 4-6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report onForm 10-K, Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1A: Risk Factors, onpages 117&#150;118 of JPMorgan Chase's Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the quarter endedMarch&nbsp;31, 2008 and Forward-Looking Statements on page 135 of this Form 10-Q. Additionally, beloware outlined some of the more important risk factors relating to JPMorgan Chase's acquisition ofBear Stearns that could materially affect the Firm's financial condition and operations.The Firm may fail to realize any benefits from the merger with Bear Stearns and may incurunanticipated losses related to Bear Stearns' assets and liabilities.Inconjunction with the Merger, in June 2008, the Federal Reserve Bankof New York (the ''FRBNY'') took control, through a limited liabilitycompany (''LLC'') formed for this purpose, of a portfolio of $30billion in assets acquired from Bear Stearns, based on the value of the portfolio as of March14, 2008. The assets of the LLC were funded by a $28.85 billion, termloan from the FRBNY, and a $1.15 billion, subordinated note fromJPMorgan Chase. The JPMorgan Chase note is subordinated to the FRBNYloan and will bear the first $1.15 billion of any losses of theportfolio. Any remaining assets in the portfolio after repayment ofthe FRBNY loan, the JPMorgan Chase note and the expenses of the LLC,will be for the account of the FRBNY. There can be no assurance thatJPMorgan Chase will not incur this $1.15&nbsp;billion in losses.JPMorgan Chase incurred a net loss of $540&nbsp;million (after-tax) during the quarter ended June&nbsp;30,2008, related to the acquisition of Bear Stearns. Given the continued market volatility anduncertainty, JPMorgan Chase may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to takeadditional markdowns and reserves on Bear Stearns' assets that could negatively affect itsfinancial condition and results of operations in the future.Inaddition, the success of the Merger will depend, in part, on JPMorgan Chase's ability tosuccessfully integrate Bear Stearns' business into its own. As with any merger of financialinstitutions, there may be business disruptions that cause Bear Stearns to lose customers or causecustomers to remove their accounts from Bear Stearns and move their business to competing financialinstitutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of eachcompany's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policiesthat could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's ability to maintain relationships with clients,customers, depositors and employees. The loss of key employees could adversely affect JPMorganChase's ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which Bear Stearns nowoperates, which could have an adverse effect on the Firm's financial results. Integration effortscould also divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firm'soperations or results. If JPMorgan Chase experiences difficulties with the integration process, theanticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer torealize than expected.139 Table of ContentsItem&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsPursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement dated March&nbsp;24, 2008 between JPMorgan Chase and BearStearns, on April&nbsp;8, 2008, 21&nbsp;million newly issued shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock wereissued to Bear Stearns in a transaction that was exempt from registration under the Securities Actof 1933, pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof, in exchange for 95&nbsp;million newly issued shares of BearStearns common stock (or 39.5% of Bear Stearns common stock after giving effect to the issuance).Upon the consummation of the Bear Stearns merger, on May&nbsp;30, 2008, the 21&nbsp;million shares ofJPMorgan Chase common stock and 95&nbsp;million shares of Bear Stearns common stock werecancelled. For a further discussion of this transaction, see Note 2on pages 80&#150;83 of this Form10-Q.On April&nbsp;17, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0&nbsp;billion of theFirm's common shares. During the second quarter and first half of 2008, under the current $10.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchaseprogram, the Firm did not repurchase any shares. During the second quarter and first half of 2007,under the respective stock repurchase programs then in effect, the Firm repurchased a total of 37million and 118&nbsp;million shares for $1.9&nbsp;billion and $5.9&nbsp;billion at an average price per share of$51.13 and $49.97, respectively. As of June&nbsp;30, 2008, $6.2&nbsp;billion of authorized repurchasecapacity remained under the current stock repurchase program.The Firm has determined that it may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of common stock inaccordance with the repurchase program. A Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchaseshares during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock, for example duringinternal trading &#147;black-out periods.&#148; All purchases under a Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 plan must be made accordingto a predefined plan that is established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublicinformation.Participants in the Firm's stock-based incentive plans may have shares withheld to cover incometaxes. Shares withheld to pay income taxes are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the applicableplan and not under the Firm's share repurchase program. Shares repurchased pursuant to these plansduring the second quarter and first half of 2008 were as follows.Item&nbsp;3 Defaults Upon Senior Securities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NoneItem&nbsp;4 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security HoldersThe Annual Meeting of Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase was held on May&nbsp;20, 2008.
