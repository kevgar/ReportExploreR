Table of ContentsEconomic value stress testingWhile VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in normal markets, stress testingcaptures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. The Firmconducts economic-value stress tests using multiple scenarios that assume credit spreads widensignificantly, equity prices decline and significant changes in interest rates across the majorcurrencies. Other scenarios focus on the risks predominant in individual business segments andinclude scenarios that focus on the potential for adverse movements in complex portfolios.Scenarios were updated more frequently in 2009 and, in some cases, redefined to reflect thesignificant market volatility which began in late 2008. Along with VaR, stress testing is importantin measuring and controlling risk. Stress testing enhances the understanding of the Firm's riskprofile and loss potential, and stress losses are monitored against limits. Stress testing is alsoutilized in one-off approvals and cross-business risk measurement, as well as an input to economiccapital allocation. Stress-test results, trends and explanations based on current market riskpositions are reported to the Firm's senior management and to the lines of business to help thembetter measure and manage risks and to understand event risk-sensitive positions.Earnings-at-risk stress testingThe VaR and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest-rateexposure on net income for the Firm's core nontrading business activities is also important. Forfurther discussion on the effect of interest rate exposure, see page 123 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report.The Firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activitiesunder a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change inthe Firm's net interest income, and the corresponding impact to the Firm's pretax earnings, overthe following 12&nbsp;months. These tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors, such asthe rates themselves (e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits, optionalityand changes in product mix. The tests include forecasted balance sheet changes, such as asset salesand securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior.Immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk, and so a number of alternativescenarios are also reviewed. These scenarios include the implied forward curve, nonparallel rateshifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates. These scenarios are intended toprovide a comprehensive view of JPMorgan Chase's earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes.JPMorgan Chase's 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profiles as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December31, 2009, were as follows.The change in earnings at risk from December&nbsp;31, 2009, resulted from investment portfoliorepositioning, assumed higher levels of deposit balances and reduced levels of fixed-rate loans.The Firm's risk to rising rates was largely the result of widening deposit margins, which arecurrently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates.Additionally, under another interest rate scenario used by the Firm, involving a steeper yieldcurve, with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at currentlevels, would result in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $605&nbsp;million. The increase inearnings under this scenario would be due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higherlong-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.98 Table of ContentsPRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of Private Equity Risk Management, see page 124 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report. At June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the carrying value of the Private Equityportfolio was $8.1&nbsp;billion and $7.3&nbsp;billion, respectively, of which $873&nbsp;million and $762&nbsp;million,respectively, represented securities with publicly available market quotations.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's Operational Risk Management, see page 125 of JPMorganChase's 2009 Annual Report.REPUTATION AND FIDUCIARY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of the Firm's Reputation and Fiduciary Risk Management, see page 126 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision and Regulationsection on pages 1-4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Form 10-K.

The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment toascertain the value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies andcontrol procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as partof such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from periodto period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process forchanging methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates fordetermining the value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a briefdescription of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant valuation judgments.Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase's allowance for credit losses covers the retained wholesale and consumer loanportfolios, as well as the Firm's portfolio of lending-related commitments. The allowance for loanlosses is intended to adjust the value of the Firm's loan assets to reflect probable credit lossesas of the balance sheet date. For a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishingthe Firm's allowance for credit losses, see Note 14 on pages 196-198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report. The methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance forlending-related commitments involves significant judgment. For a further description of thesejudgments, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-128 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 AnnualReport; for amounts recorded as of June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, see Allowance for Credit Losses on pages91-94 and Note 14 on pages 150-151 of this Form 10-Q.As noted on page 127 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report, many factors can affect estimates ofloss, including volatility of loss given default, probability of default and rating migrations. TheFirm uses a risk-rating system to determine the credit quality of its wholesale loans. The Firm'swholesale allowance is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to a loan. As of June&nbsp;30, 2010,assuming a one-notch downgrade in the Firm's internal risk ratings for its entire wholesaleportfolio, the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale portfolio would increase byapproximately $1.2&nbsp;billion. This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and intended to provide anindication of the impact of risk ratings on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses forwholesale loans. In the Firm's view, the likelihood of a one-notch downgrade for all wholesaleloans within a short timeframe is remote, and it is not intended to imply management's expectationof future deterioration in risk ratings. Given the process the Firm follows in determining the riskratings of its loans, management believes the risk ratings currently assigned to wholesale loansare appropriate.The allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio is sensitive to changes in the economicenvironment, delinquency status, FICO scores, the realizable value of collateral, borrower behaviorand other risk factors. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio across the entire consumercredit product spectrum appears to have stabilized but remains under stress, as high unemploymentand weak overall economic conditions continue to result in a high level of delinquencies, whilecontinued weak housing prices continue to result in elevated loss severities. Significant judgmentis required to estimate the ultimate duration and severity of the current economic downturn, aswell as its impact on housing prices and the labor market. While the allowance for credit losses ishighly sensitive to both home prices and unemployment rates, in the current market it is difficultto estimate how potential changes in one or both of these factors might impact the allowance forcredit losses. For example, while both factors are important determinants of overall allowancelevels, changes in one factor or the other may not occur at the same rate, or improvement in onefactor may offset deterioration in the other. In addition, changes in these factors would notnecessarily be consistent across geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predictthe extent to which changes in both or either of these factors would ultimately impact thefrequency or severity of losses, and overall loss rates are a function of both the frequency andseverity of individual loan losses.Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventoryJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of suchassets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets andliabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including loans accounted for atthe lower of cost or fair value that are only subject to fair value adjustments under certaincircumstances.100 Table of ContentsAssets measured at fair valueThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of suchassets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.ValuationFor instruments classified within level 3 of the hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair valuemay be significant. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack ofobservability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in derivingvaluation inputs &#151; including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities,equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. In addition to market information,models also incorporate transaction details, such as maturity. Finally, management judgment must beapplied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty creditquality, the Firm's creditworthiness, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters, whererelevant. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specificcontractual terms, as well as the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as awhole. For further discussion of changes in level 3 assets, see Note3 on pages 110-124 of thisForm 10-Q.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of revenue or lossrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods areappropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the use of differentmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments couldresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion ofthe determination of fair value for individual financial instruments,see Note 3 on pages 148-152of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. In addition, for a further discussion of the significantjudgments and estimates involved in the determination of the Firm's mortgage-related exposures, see&#147;Mortgage-related exposures carried at fair value&#148; in Note3 on pages 161-162 of JPMorgan Chase's2009 Annual Report.Purchased credit-impaired loansIn connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans withevidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and for which it was probable, atacquisition, that the Firm would be unable to collect all contractually required paymentsreceivable. These purchased credit-impaired loans are accounted for101 Table of Contentson a pool basis, and the pools are considered to be performing. At the time of the acquisition,these loans were recorded at fair value, including an estimate of losses that were expected to beincurred over the estimated remaining lives of the loan pools. Many of the assumptions andestimates underlying the estimation of the initial fair value and the ongoing updates tomanagement's expectation of future cash flows are both significant and subjective, particularlyconsidering the current economic environment. The level of future home price declines, the durationand severity of the current economic downturn, the impact of various government programs andactions, uncertainties about borrower behavior, and the lack of market liquidity and transparencyare factors that have influenced, and may continue to affect, these assumptions and estimates.In accounting for these loans on an ongoing basis, probable decreases in expected loan principalcash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, while probable and significant increases inexpected principal cash flows would first trigger the reversal of any previously recorded allowancefor loan losses; any remaining increases would be recognized prospectively as yield adjustments.The impact of (i)&nbsp;prepayments, (ii)&nbsp;changes in variable interest rates and (iii)&nbsp;any other changesin the timing of expected cash flows would be recognized prospectively as yield adjustments. Theprocess to determine which changes in cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment, and whichchanges in cash flows should be recognized as yield adjustments, requires the application ofjudgment. As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, a 1% decrease in expected future principal cash payments for theentire portfolio of purchased credit-impaired loans would result in the recognition of an allowancefor loan losses for these loans of approximately $730&nbsp;million. For additional information onpurchased credit-impaired loans, including the significant assumptions, estimates and judgmentinvolved, see Purchased credit-impaired loans on pages 129&#151;130 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 AnnualReport and Note 13 on pages 149-150 of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. For a description ofthe significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, see Goodwill impairment onpage 130 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.During the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuations ofcertain consumer lending businesses in RFS and CS, which continue to have elevated risk forgoodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects ofregulatory and legislative changes. The assumptions used in the valuation of these businessesinclude a) estimates of future cash flows for the business (which are dependent on portfoliooutstanding balances, net interest margin, operating expenses, credit losses and the amount ofcapital necessary given the risk of business activities and to meet regulatory capitalrequirements), and b) the cost of equity used to discount those cash flows to a present value. Eachof these factors require significant judgment and the assumptions used are based on management'sbest and most current projections, including the anticipated effects of regulatory and legislativechanges, derived from the Firm's business forecasting process reviewed with senior management.These projections are consistent with the short-term estimates addressed in the Business Outlook onpages 9-10 of this Form 10-Q, and in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomicassumptions (for example, allowing for relatively high but gradually declining unemployment ratesfor the next few years) and the Firm's best estimates of long-term growth of its businesses. Wherepossible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.In addition, for its other businesses, the Firm reviewed current conditions (including theestimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes) and prior projections of businessperformance. Based upon the updated valuations for its consumer lending businesses and reviews ofits other businesses, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to all of its reporting units wasnot impaired at June&nbsp;30 and March&nbsp;31, 2010. However, the fair value of the credit card lendingbusiness within CS and a consumer lending business within RFS exceeded their carrying values bynarrow margins at June&nbsp;30 and March&nbsp;31, 2010 ranging from 3-15%. Deterioration in economic marketconditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, oradditional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected businessperformance beyond management's expectations. For example, in CS, such declines could result fromdeterioration in economic conditions such as increased unemployment claims or bankruptcy filingsthat result in increased credit losses, changes in customer behavior that cause decreased accountactivity or receivable balances, or unanticipated effects of regulatory or legislative changes. InRFS, such declines could result from deterioration in economic conditions that result in increasedcredit losses, including decreases in home prices beyond management expectations.Such declines in business performance, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could causethe estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline,which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to someportion of the associated goodwill.Foradditional information on goodwill, see Note 16 on pages 164-167 of this Form 10-Q.Income taxesFor a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with theaccounting for income taxes, see Income taxes on page 131 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.102 Table of ContentsACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTSAccounting for transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entitiesEffective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm implemented new accounting guidance that amends the accountingfor the transfers of financial assets and the consolidation of VIEs. Upon adoption of the newguidance, the Firm consolidated its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts,Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and certain mortgage and other consumer loan securitizationentities. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) deferred the requirements of the newconsolidation guidance for VIEs for certain investment funds, including mutual funds, privateequity funds and hedge funds, until the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board(&#147;IASB&#148;) complete a joint consolidation project that would provide consistent accounting guidancefor these funds. For additional information about the impact of the adoption of the newconsolidation guidance on January&nbsp;1, 2010, see Note 15 on pages151-163 of this Form 10-Q.Fair value measurements and disclosuresIn January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires new disclosures, and clarifies existingdisclosure requirements, about fair value measurements. The clarifications and the requirement toseparately disclose transfers of instruments between level 1 and level 2 of the fair valuehierarchy are effective for interim reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2009; the Firmadopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2010. For additional information about theimpact of the adoption of the new fair value measurements guidance,see Note 3 on pages 110-124 ofthis Form 10-Q. In addition, a new requirement to provide purchases, sales, issuances andsettlements in the level 3 rollforward on a gross basis is effective for fiscal years beginningafter December&nbsp;15, 2010. Early adoption of the guidance is permitted.Subsequent eventsIn May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance that established general standards of accounting for anddisclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements areissued or are available to be issued. The guidance was effective for interim or annual financialperiods ending after June&nbsp;15, 2009. In February&nbsp;2010, the FASB amended the guidance by eliminatingthe requirement for SEC filers to disclose the date through which it evaluated subsequent events.The Firm adopted the amended guidance in the first quarter of 2010. The application of the guidancehad no effect on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.Accounting for certain embedded credit derivativesIn March&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance clarifying the circumstances in which a credit derivativeembedded in a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets is required to be separatelyaccounted for as a derivative instrument. The guidance is effective for the first fiscal quarterbeginning after June&nbsp;15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the new guidancepermits the election of the fair value option for any beneficial interest in securitized financialassets. Adoption of the new guidance will not have a material impact on the Firm's ConsolidatedBalance Sheets or results of operations.Accounting for modifications of purchased credit-impaired loans that are part of a poolIn April&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for modifications of purchasedcredit-impaired loans accounted for within a pool. The guidance clarifies that modified purchasedcredit-impaired loans should not be removed from a pool even if the modification would otherwise beconsidered a troubled debt restructuring. Additionally, the guidance clarifies that the impact ofmodifications should be included in evaluating whether a pool of loans is impaired. The guidance iseffective for modifications of purchased credit-impaired loans occurring in interim and annualreporting periods ending on or after July&nbsp;15, 2010, and is to be applied prospectively. Earlyadoption is permitted. The guidance is consistent with the Firm's current accounting practice and,therefore, will have no impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.Disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit lossesIn July&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance that will require enhanced disclosures surrounding thecredit characteristics of the Firm's loan portfolio. Under the new guidance, the Firm will berequired to disclose its accounting policies, the methods it uses to determine the components ofthe allowance for credit losses, and qualitative and quantitative information about the credit riskinherent in the loan portfolio, including additional information on certain types of loanmodifications. For the Firm, the new disclosures are effective for the 2010 Annual Report. The newdisclosures on the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses and the new disclosures abouttroubled-debt modifications are effective for the first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q. The adoption ofthis guidance will only affect JPMorgan Chase's disclosures of financing receivables and not itsConsolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.103 Table of ContentsJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED)CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED)The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)&nbsp;are an integral part of these statements.104 Table of ContentsJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)The assets of the consolidated VIEs are used to settle the liabilities of those entities.

(&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;), a financial holding company incorporatedunder Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largestbanking institutions in the United States of America (&#147;U.S.&#148;), with operations worldwide. The Firmis a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and businesses, financialtransaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm's business segmentinformation, see Note 23 on pages 174-178 of this Form 10-Q.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform toaccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelinesprescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The unaudited consolidated financial statements preparedin conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingentassets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion ofmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of thisinterim financial information. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read inconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto includedin JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, as filed withthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;2009 Annual Report&#148;).Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.ConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities inwhich the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances andtransactions have been eliminated. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financialinterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or avariable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;).Voting Interest EntitiesVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investorsvoting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations.For these types of entities, the Firm's determination of whether it has a controlling interest isprimarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has acontrolling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities' voting equityinterests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by theFirm.Investments in companies that are considered to be voting interest entities in which the Firm hassignificant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of thevoting equity interests) are accounted for (i)&nbsp;in accordance with the equity method of accounting(which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity's net earnings), or(ii)&nbsp;at fair value if the fair value option was elected at the inception of the Firm's investment.These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in otherincome.Firm-sponsored asset management funds are generally structured as limited partnerships or limitedliability companies and are typically considered voting interest entities. For the significantmajority of these entities, for which the Firm is the general partner or managing member of thelimited partnership or limited liability company (&#147;LLC&#148;), the non-affiliated partners or membershave the substantive ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member withoutcause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple unaffiliated majority vote, or the non-affiliatedpartners or members have substantive participating rights. Accordingly, the Firm does notconsolidate these funds. In limited cases where the non-affiliated partners or members do not havesubstantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm consolidates the underlying funds.Private equity investments, which are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,include investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments areaccounted for under investment company guidelines and accordingly, irrespective of the percentageof equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.108 Table of ContentsVariable Interest EntitiesVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1)&nbsp;lack sufficient equity to permit the entity tofinance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2)have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to theentity's operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expectedlosses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.The most common type of VIE is a special purpose entity (&#147;SPE&#148;). SPEs are commonly used insecuritization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows fromthose assets to investors. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, including themortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide marketliquidity by facilitating investors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. SPEs may beorganized as trusts, partnerships or corporations and are typically established for a single,discrete purpose. SPEs are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and noemployees. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds thepurchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern thetransaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE's investors andother parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulateinvestors from claims on the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditorsof the seller of the assets.On January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm implemented new consolidation accounting guidance related to VIEs. Thenew guidance eliminates the concept of qualified special purpose entities (&#147;QSPEs&#148;) that werepreviously exempt from consolidation, and introduces a new framework for determining the primarybeneficiary of a VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets andliabilities of the VIE. Under the new guidance, the primary beneficiary is the party that has both(1)&nbsp;the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the VIE'seconomic performance; and (2)&nbsp;through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses orthe right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantlyimpact the VIE's economic performance, the Firm considers all facts and circumstances, includingits role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessmentincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economicperformance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. Ingeneral, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as assetmanagers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over theVIE's assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have thepower to direct the activities of a VIE.To assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receivebenefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all ofits economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivative orother arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that theFirm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are consideredpotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: thedesign of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; paymentpriority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE's capitalstructure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: 1) whether any entities previously evaluated under themajority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subjectto the VIE consolidation framework; and 2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regardingthe Firm's involvement with a VIE cause the Firm's consolidation conclusion regarding the VIE tochange.Forfurther details regarding the Firm's application of the newaccounting guidance effective January 1, 2010, see Note 15 on pages 151-163 of this Form 10-Q. For a description of the accountingguidance applied to periods ending prior to January&nbsp;1, 2010, see Note 1 on page 142 of JPMorganChase's 2009 Annual Report.In February&nbsp;2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an amendment whichdefers the requirements of the new consolidation accounting guidance for certain investment funds,including mutual funds, private equity funds and hedge funds. For funds to which the amendmentapplies, the consolidation guidance will be deferred until thecompletion of the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board(&#147;IASB&#148;)joint consolidation project. For the funds to which the amendment applies, the Firm continues toapply other existing authoritative guidance to determine whether such funds should be consolidated.Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.109 Table of ContentsNOTE 2 &#151; BUSINESS CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Purchase of remaining interest in J.P. Morgan CazenoveOn January&nbsp;4, 2010, JPMorgan Chase purchased the remaining interest in J.P.

When a determination is made to classifya financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of theunobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financialinstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observablecomponents (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part toobservable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages theobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positionsthat are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables donot reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3instruments.114 Table of Contents115 Table of Contents116 Table of Contents117 Table of Contents118 Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value ona nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but aresubject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there isevidence of impairment). The following tables present the assets and liabilities carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheets by caption and level within the valuation hierarchy as of June&nbsp;30,2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded duringthe reporting period.The method used to estimate the fair value of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and otherloans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g.,residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), depends on the typeof collateral (e.g., securities, real estate, and nonfinancial assets). Fair value of thecollateral is estimated based on quoted market prices, broker quotes or independent appraisals, orby using a DCF model. For further information, see Note 14 on pages150-151 of this Form 10-Q.Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fairvalue adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and sixmonths ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, related to financial instruments held at those dates.119 Table of ContentsLevel 3 analysisLevel 3 assets at June&nbsp;30, 2010, principally include derivative receivables, mortgage servicingrights (&#147;MSRs&#148;), trading loans, and collateralized loan obligations (&#147;CLOs&#148;) held within theavailable-for-sale securities portfolio. For further discussion of JPMorgan Chase's valuationmethodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, seeNote 3 on pages 148-165 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Consolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 6% of totalFirm assets at June&nbsp;30, 2010. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets duringthe quarter.For the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010Level 3 assets were $119.9&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2010, reflecting a decrease of $2.0&nbsp;billion from thefirst quarter. The decrease is mainly due to:For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010Level 3 assets decreased by $10.5&nbsp;billion in the first six months of 2010, due to the following:120 Table of ContentsGains and LossesIncludedin the tables for the three months ended June&nbsp;30,2010Included in the tables for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2009Included in the tables for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010Included in the tables for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2009Credit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuationadjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are notlimited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm's own creditworthiness. Themarket's view of the Firm's credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the creditdefault swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, seeNote 3 on pages 148-165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity,reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.121 Table of ContentsThe following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respectiveperiods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments (including financialinstruments not carried at fair value)U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value ofcertain financial instruments, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate theirfair value. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included inthe following table. Additionally, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instrumentsare excluded from the scope. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures provided in the followingtable include only a partial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, the Firmhas developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit cardaccounts, commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In theopinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, buttheir fair value is not disclosed in this Note.Financial instruments for which carryingvalue approximates fair valueCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheetsare carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generallynegligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks; deposits with banks,federal funds sold; securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed withshort-dated maturities; short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable; commercial paper;federal funds purchased; securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements with short-datedmaturities; other borrowed funds (excluding advances from Federal Home Loan Banks (&#147;FHLBs&#148;);accounts payable; and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value fordeposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money marketdeposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of theseinstruments is not permitted.122 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial assets andliabilities.&nbsp;123 Table of ContentsThe majority of the Firm's unfunded lending-related commitments are not carried at fair valueon a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carryingvalue and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending-related commitments were as followsfor the periods indicated.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In manycases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower prior notice or,in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. For a further discussion of the valuation oflending-related commitments, see Note 3 on pages 149-150 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Tradingassets and liabilities &#150; average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.124 Table of ContentsNOTE 4 &#151; FAIR VALUE OPTION For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which fair value elections have beenmade, including the determination of instrument-specific credit risk for these items and the basisfor those elections, see Note 4 on pages 165-167 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.2010 ElectionsIn connection with the adoption of the new consolidation guidance related to VIEs, effectiveJanuary&nbsp;1, 2010, the fair value option was elected for long-term beneficial interests related tosecuritization trusts within IB that were consolidated where the underlying assets are carried atfair value.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements ofIncome for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, for items for which the fairvalue election was made. The profit and loss information presented below only includes thefinancial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk managementinstruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.125 Table of Contents126 Table of ContentsDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balanceoutstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregateremaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, forloans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has beenelected.127 Table of ContentsNOTE 5 &#151; DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTSFor a further discussion of the Firm's use and accounting policies regarding derivativeinstruments, see Note 5 on pages 167&#151;175 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of June30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm'sderivative activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possiblelosses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notionalamount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.128 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following tables summarize information on derivative fair values that are reflected on theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, by accountingdesignation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.Free-standing derivatives(a)Derivative receivables and payables mark-to-marketThe following table summarizes the fair values of derivative receivables and payables, includingthose designated as hedges by contract type after netting adjustments as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009.129 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives and hedged items on the income statement and on other comprehensiveincomeThe following tables summarize the total pretax impact of JPMorgan Chase's derivative-relatedactivities on the Firm's Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income for thethree and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, by accounting designation.130 Table of ContentsThe tables that follow reflect more detailed information regarding the derivative-relatedincome statement impact by accounting designation for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010and 2009, respectively.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedgeaccounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and therelated hedged items for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. TheFirm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same lineitem in the Consolidated Statements of Income.131 Table of ContentsCash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedgeaccounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the threeand six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on thehedging derivative in the same line item as the offsetting change in cash flows on the hedged itemin the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, the Firm expects that $296&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin AOCI at June&nbsp;30, 2010, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximumlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and such transactionsprimarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.132 Table of ContentsNet investment hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in netinvestment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on suchinstruments for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Riskmanagement derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedginginstruments)The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated inhedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the three andsix months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These derivatives are risk managementinstruments used to mitigate or transform the risk of market exposures arising from bankingactivities other than trading activities, which are discussed separately below.133 Table of ContentsTrading derivative gains and lossesThe following table presents trading derivatives gains and losses, by contract type, that arerecorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the threeand six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Firm has elected to presentderivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with the cash instrumentswith which they are risk managed.Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresDerivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typicallyrequire the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the mark-to-market(&#147;MTM&#148;) moves in the counterparties' favor, or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's or itssubsidiaries' respective credit ratings. At June&nbsp;30, 2010, the impact of a single-notch andsix-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan ChaseBank, National Association (&#147;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#148;) would have required $1.5&nbsp;billion and $5.0billion, respectively, of additional collateral to be posted by the Firm. Certain derivativecontracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either theFirm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. At June&nbsp;30, 2010, theimpact of single-notch and six-notch ratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and itssubsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., related to contracts with termination triggerswould have required the Firm to settle trades with a fair value of $349&nbsp;million and $6.3&nbsp;billion,respectively. The aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingentcollateral or termination features triggered upon a downgrade was $37.0&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2010,for which the Firm has posted collateral of $30.2&nbsp;billion in the normal course of business.The following tables show the current credit risk of derivative receivables after nettingadjustments and collateral received, and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables afternetting adjustments and collateral posted, as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009,respectively.In addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the tables above, at June&nbsp;30, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm had received liquid securities collateral in the amount of $19.3billion and $15.5&nbsp;billion, respectively, and posted $12.0&nbsp;billion and $11.7&nbsp;billion, respectively.The Firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions, whichis available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of thetransactions move in the Firm's or client's favor, respectively. Furthermore, the Firm and itscounterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency forcollateral to be posted, and collateral that the Firm or a counterparty has agreed to return buthas not yet settled as of the reporting date. At June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm hadreceived $16.1&nbsp;billion and $16.9&nbsp;billion, respectively, and delivered $9.7&nbsp;billion and $5.8billion, respectively, of such additional collateral. These amounts were not netted against thederivative receivables and payables in the tables above, because, at an individual counterpartylevel, the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at both June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31,2009.134 Table of ContentsCredit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including a description of the differenttypes used by the Firm, see Note 5 on pages 167&#151;175, of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009. Upon acredit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of thefull notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on thecontracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time ofsettlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasingprotection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. As such, other purchasedprotection referenced in the following tables include credit derivatives bought on related, but notidentical, reference positions; these include indices, portfolio coverage and other referencepoints. The Firm does not use notional amounts as the primary measure of risk management for creditderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of theoccurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cashinstruments and economic hedges.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, where JPMorgan Chase is the sellerof protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the creditderivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on whichthe credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of protection purchasedare comparable to the profile reflected below.135 Table of ContentsProtection sold &#151; credit derivatives and credit-related notesratings(a)/maturity profileNOTE 6 &#151; OTHER NONINTEREST REVENUEFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's other noninterestrevenue, see Note 6 on pages 175&#151;176 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.The following table presents principal transactions revenue.The following table presents components of asset management, administration and commissions.136 Table of ContentsNOTE 7 &#151; INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSEDetails of interest income and interest expense were as follows.NOTE 8 &#151; PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#147;OPEB&#148;)plans, see Note 8 on pages 176&#151;183 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit cost reported in theConsolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEBplans.137 Table of ContentsThe fair value of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for thematerial non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $11.0&nbsp;billion and $2.3&nbsp;billion, respectively,as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and $11.5&nbsp;billion and $2.4&nbsp;billion, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. SeeNote 20 on pages 168&#151;169 of this Form 10-Q for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e.,net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010and 2009.The amount, if any, of 2010 potential contributions for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pensionplans is not reasonably estimable at this time. The 2010 potential contributions for the Firm'sU.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans are estimated to be $42&nbsp;million and for thenon-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are estimated to be $171&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million,respectively.NOTE 9 &#151; EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVESFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-basedincentives, see Note 9 on pages 184&#151;186 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The Firm recognized noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-basedincentive plans of $832&nbsp;million and $884&nbsp;million for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009,respectively, and $1.8&nbsp;billion and $1.7&nbsp;billion for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009,respectively, in its Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010and 2009, these amounts included expense of $645&nbsp;million and $692&nbsp;million, respectively, related tothe cost of prior grants of restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) and stock appreciation rights (&#147;SARs&#148;)that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods, and expense of $187&nbsp;million and $192million, respectively, related to the accrual of estimated costs of RSUs and SARs to be granted infuture periods to full-career eligible employees. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010, and 2009,these amounts included expense of $1.4&nbsp;billion and $1.4&nbsp;billion, respectively, related to the costof prior grants of RSUs and SARs that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods, andexpense of $440&nbsp;million and $332&nbsp;million, respectively, related to the accrual of estimated costsof RSUs and SARs to be granted in future periods to full-career eligible employees.In the first quarter of 2010, the Firm granted 71&nbsp;million RSUs, with a weighted average grant datefair value of $43.12 per RSU, in connection with its annual incentive grant.138 Table of ContentsNOTE 10 &#151; NONINTEREST EXPENSEThe following table presents the components of noninterest expense.NOTE 11 &#151; SECURITIESSecurities are classified as AFS, held-to-maturity (&#147;HTM&#148;) or trading. For additional informationregarding AFS and HTM securities, see Note 11 on pages 187&#151;191 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 AnnualReport. Trading securities are discussed in Note 3 on pages 110&#151;124 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and credit losses that were recognized inincome from AFS securities.139 Table of ContentsThe amortized costs and estimated fair values of AFS and HTM securities were as follows forthe dates indicated.140 Table of ContentsSecurities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for AFS securities by agingcategory at June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.141 Table of ContentsOther-than-temporary impairment (&#147;OTTI&#148;)The following table presents credit losses that are included in the securities gains and lossestable above.Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and2009, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income, related todebt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.Unrealized losses have generally decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, due primarily to marketspread improvement and increased liquidity, driving asset prices higher. Unrealized losses oncertain securities have increased, including on corporate debt securities which includedgovernment-guaranteed positions that experienced credit spread widening. As of June&nbsp;30, 2010, theFirm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely thatthe Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognizedin income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are notother-than-temporarily impaired as of June&nbsp;30, 2010.Following is a description of the Firm's main security investments with the most significantunrealized losses as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and the key assumptions used in its estimate of the presentvalue of the cash flows most likely to be collected from these investments.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; Prime and Alt-A nonagencyAs of June&nbsp;30, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backedsecurities issued by private issuers were $420&nbsp;million, all of which related to securities thathave been in an unrealized loss position for 12&nbsp;months or more. Overall losses havedecreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, due to increased market stabilization, resulting from increaseddemand for higher-yielding asset classes and U.S. government programs. Approximately one-fifth ofthese positions (by amortized cost) are currently rated &#147;AAA.&#148; The remaining four-fifths haveexperienced downgrades since purchase, and approximately half of the downgraded positions arecurrently rated below investment-grade. Despite significant downgrades experienced in theportfolio, most of these are senior positions and possess adequate credit enhancement to absorbfuture expected losses. In analyzing prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities forpotential credit losses, the Firm utilizes a methodology that focuses on loan-level detail toestimate future cash flows, which are then applied to the various tranches of issued securitiesbased on their respective contractual provisions of the securitization trust. The loan-levelanalysis considers prepayment, home price, default rate and loss severity assumptions. Given thislevel of granularity, the underlying assumptions vary significantly taking into consideration suchfactors as the financial condition of the borrower, loan-to-value (&#147;LTV&#148;) ratio, loan type andgeographical location of the underlying property. The weighted average underlying default rate onthe positions was 23% and the related weighted average loss severity was 50%. Based on thisanalysis, the Firm has not recognized any additional OTTI losses in earnings during the secondquarter of 2010; however, an OTTI loss of $6&nbsp;million was142 Table of Contentsrecognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to securities that experienced increaseddelinquency rates associated with specific collateral types and origination dates. The unrealizedloss of $420&nbsp;million is considered temporary, based on management's assessment that the creditenhancement levels for those securities remain sufficient to support the Firm's investment.Asset-backed securities &#151; Collateralized loan obligationsAs of June&nbsp;30, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to CLOs were $262&nbsp;million, all of whichrelated to securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12&nbsp;months or more.Overall losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, mainly as a result of lower defaultforecasts and spread tightening across various asset classes. Substantially all of these securitiesare rated &#147;AAA,&#148; &#147;AA&#148; and &#147;A&#148; and have an average credit enhancement of 29%. Credit enhancement inCLOs is primarily in the form of overcollateralization, which is the excess of the par amount ofcollateral over the par amount of securities. The key assumptions considered in analyzing potentialcredit losses were underlying loan and debt security defaults and loss severity. Based on currentdefault trends, the Firm assumed collateral default rates of 5% for the second quarter 2010 andthereafter. Further, loss severities were assumed to be 50% for loans and 80% for debt securities.Losses on collateral were estimated to occur approximately 24&nbsp;months after default.143 Table of ContentsContractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at June&nbsp;30, 2010, ofJPMorgan Chase's AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.144 Table of ContentsNOTE 12 &#151; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIESFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 12 onpage 192 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. For further information regarding securitiesborrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, seeNote 4 on pages 125-127 of this Form 10-Q.The following table details the Firm's repurchase agreements, resale agreements, securitiesborrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions, all of which are accounted for ascollateralized financings during the periods presented.The amounts reported in the table above have been reduced by $135.2&nbsp;billion and $121.2&nbsp;billionat June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively, as a result of the agreements having met thespecified conditions for net presentation under applicable accounting guidance.JPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchase agreementsand other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the securedparty are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.At June&nbsp;30, 2010, the Firmreceived securities as collateral that could be repledged, delivered orotherwise used with a fair value of approximately $623.3&nbsp;billion. This collateral was generallyobtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements and customer margin loans. Ofthese securities, approximately $439.0&nbsp;billion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used,generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to covershort sales.NOTE 13 &#151; LOANSThe accounting for a loan may differ based on whether it is originated or purchased and whether theloan is used in an investing or trading strategy. The measurement framework for loans in theConsolidated Financial Statements is one of the following:For a detailed discussion of the accounting policies relating to loans, see Note 13 on pages192-196 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. See Note 4on pages 125-127 of this Form 10-Q forfurther information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.See Note 3 on pages 110-124 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fairvalue and classified as trading assets.145 Table of ContentsThe composition of the Firm's aggregate loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was asfollows.146 Table of ContentsThe following table reflects information about the Firm's loan sales.Impaired loansFor further discussion of impaired loans, including the nature of such loans and the relatedaccounting policies, and certain troubled debt restructurings, seeNote 13 on pages 192-196 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The tables below set forth information about the Firm's impaired loans, excluding both purchasedcredit-impaired loans and modified credit card loans, which are discussed separately below.Loan modificationsCertain loan modifications are made in conjunction with the Firm's loss mitigation activities.Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who isexperiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm's economic loss, avoid foreclosureor repossession of the collateral and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from theborrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and mayinclude interest rate reductions, payment deferrals, or the acceptance of equity or other assets inlieu of payments. In certain limited circumstances, loan modifications include principalforgiveness, which has been minimal to-date. All such modifications are accounted for and reportedas troubled debt restructurings.A loan that has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring is generally considered to beimpaired until its maturity, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms.In certain limited cases, the concession granted relates solely to principal adjustments or othernoninterest-rate concessions, and the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is ator above the current market rate at that time. In such circumstances, the loan is disclosed asimpaired and as a troubled debt restructuring only during the year of the modification; insubsequent years, the loan is147 Table of Contentsnot disclosed as impaired or as a troubled debt restructuring if repayment of the restructured loanon its modified terms is reasonably assured.It is the Firm's general policy to place loans, other than credit card loans, on nonperformingstatus when the loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring. In most cases, residential realestate and commercial loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring were considered nonperformingprior to their modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (resuming the accrualof interest) if the criteria set forth in the Firm's accounting policy are met. These criteriagenerally include (a)&nbsp;performance under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or sixpayments, and (b)&nbsp;an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured basedon, for example, the borrower's debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTVratios, and other current market considerations. The Firm's policy exempts credit card loans,including modified credit card loans, from being placed on nonperforming status as permitted byregulatory guidance. However, the Firm has separately established an allowance for the portion ofearned interest and fees on such modified credit card loans that it estimates to be uncollectible.The allowance for loan losses for loans modified in troubled debt restructurings is determinedbased on the same methodology used to estimate the Firm's asset-specific allowance component for aslong as the loan continues to be reported as an impaired loan, regardless of whether the loan hasreturned to performing status. For further discussion of the methodology used to estimate theFirm's asset-specific allowance, see Note 14 on pages 196-198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 AnnualReport.WholesaleAs of June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, wholesale loans modified in troubled debtrestructurings were $1.1&nbsp;billion for both periods. These modifications generally provided interestrate concessions to the borrower or deferral of principal repayments. Of these loans, $524&nbsp;millionand $491&nbsp;million were classified as nonperforming at June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009,respectively.ConsumerFor detailed discussions on the U.S. Treasury Making Home Affordable (&#147;MHA&#148;) programs and theFirm's other loss-mitigation programs, see Note 13, Impairedloans, on pages 194-195 of JPMorganChase's 2009 Annual Report. Substantially all of the modifications made under these programs areaccounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings.Consumer loans, other than credit card loans and certain home loans repurchased from the GovernmentNational Mortgage Association (&#147;Ginnie Mae&#148;), with balances of approximately $4.9&nbsp;billion and $3.1billion have been permanently modified and accounted for as troubled debt restructurings as of June30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively. Of these loans, $1.9&nbsp;billion and $966&nbsp;million wereclassified as nonperforming at June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.At June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, $1.7&nbsp;billion and $296&nbsp;million, respectively, of loansmodified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae were excluded from loans accounted for astroubled debt restructurings. When such loans perform subsequent to modification they are generallysold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject toforeclosure. Substantially all amounts due under the terms of these loans continue to be insuredand, where applicable, reimbursement of insured amounts is proceeding normally.Credit CardFor a detailed discussion of the modification of the terms of credit card loan agreements, see Note13 on pages 192-196 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. Substantially all modifications ofcredit card loans performed under the Firm's existing modification programs are considered to betroubled debt restructurings. At June&nbsp;30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm had $9.3&nbsp;billionand $5.1&nbsp;billion, respectively, of on-balance sheet credit card loans outstanding for borrowers whoare experiencing financial difficulty and who were then enrolled in a credit card modificationprogram. The increase in modified credit card loans outstanding from December&nbsp;31, 2009 to June&nbsp;30,2010, is primarily attributable to previously-modified loans held in Firm-sponsored credit cardsecuritization trusts being consolidated as a result of adopting the new consolidation guidancerelated to VIEs. These modified loan amounts exclude loans to borrowers who have not complied withthe modified payment terms, thereby causing the loan agreement to revert back to its originalpayment terms. Assuming that those borrowers do not begin to perform in accordance with theoriginal payment terms, those loans will continue to age and will ultimately be charged-off inaccordance with the Firm's accounting policies.Consistent with the Firm's policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status.148 Table of ContentsThe consumer formula-based allowance for loan losses includes $3.6&nbsp;billion and $2.2&nbsp;billion at June30, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, specifically attributable to credit card loans in loanmodification programs. This component of the allowance for loan losses has been determined based onthe present value of cash flows expected to be received over the estimated lives of the underlyingloans.Purchased credit-impaired loansIn connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans that itdeemed to be credit-impaired. For a detailed discussion of purchased credit-impaired loans,including the related accounting policies, see Note 13 on pages 192-196 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for purchased credit-impaired consumerloans for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and 2009.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to becollected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i)&nbsp;changes in the benchmarkinterest rate indices upon which customer rates are based for products such as option ARM and homeequity loans; and (ii)&nbsp;changes in prepayment assumptions.To date, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decreasein interest rates on variable rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidationperiods. Certain events, such as extended loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expectedcash flows but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., the accretable yield balance).Extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage because the sameaccretable yield balance is recognized against a higher than expected loan balance over a longerthan expected period of time.The purchased credit-impaired portfolio primarily impacts the Firm's results of operations through:(i)&nbsp;contribution to net interest margin; and (ii)&nbsp;expense related to defaults and servicingresulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii)&nbsp;any provision for loan losses. The purchasedcredit-impaired loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction were funded based on theinterest rate characteristics of the loans. For example, variable-rate loans were funded withvariable-rate liabilities and fixed-rate loans were funded with fixed-rate liabilities with asimilar maturity profile. As a result, the net spread between the purchased credit-impaired loansand the related liabilities should be relatively constant over time, except for any basis risk orother residual interest rate risk that remains and changes in the accretable yield percentage(e.g., from extended loan liquidation periods). The net spread will be earned on a declining loanbalance over the estimated remaining weighted-average life of the portfolio, which is 6.6&nbsp;years asof June&nbsp;30, 2010.While the Firm has modified certain purchased credit-impaired loans, such modifications have notyet seasoned and the ongoing performance of these loans is difficult to predict. Accordingly, theFirm has not yet incorporated the potential positive cash flow effects of these modifications intoits expected cash flow estimates. The Firm will continue to monitor the success of themodifications and its ability to reliably estimate any related cash flow benefits. If themodifications ultimately result in a probable and significant increase in expected cash flows, theFirm will first consider the reversal of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses. Anyremaining increase will be recognized prospectively as interest income (through an increase inaccretable yield).149
