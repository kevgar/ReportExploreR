NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe unaudited financial statements of The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("Chase")are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles forinterim financial information. In the opinion of management, all necessaryadjustments have been included for a fair presentation of this interim financialinformation. In addition, certain amounts have been reclassified to conform tothe current presentation.In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-1, which becomes effective for financialstatements for calendar year 1999. Chase elected early adoption beginning in thefirst quarter of 1998. SOP 98-1 requires the capitalization of eligible costs ofspecified activities related to computer software developed or obtained forinternal use. Chase capitalized $68 million of these costs during the first ninemonths of 1998, of which $32 million was capitalized during the third quarter.NOTE 2 - STOCK SPLITOn May 19, 1998, the stockholders approved a two-for-one stock split of Chasecommon stock. The additional shares issued as a result of the split weredistributed on June 12, 1998 to stockholders of record at the close of businesson May 20, 1998. A total of 440,767,205 shares of common stock were issued inconnection with the split, including 14,176,530 shares held in treasury. As aresult of the stock split, $441 million was reclassified from capital surplus tocommon stock. The stock split did not cause any changes in the $1.00 par valueper share for the common stock or in total stockholders' equity. All referencesto the number of common shares and per common share amounts have been restatedto reflect the effects of the stock split.NOTE 3 - COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEEffective with the first quarter 1998, Chase adopted SFAS 130, which defines andestablishes the standards for reporting comprehensive income. Comprehensiveincome for Chase includes net income as well as the change in unrealized gainsand losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation,each of which includes the impact of related derivatives. Chase has presentedthese items net of tax in the Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.Nine months Ended September 30,(in millions)(a) Represents the after-tax difference between the fair value and amortized cost of available-for-sale securities portfolio including securities classified as loans, which are subject to the provisions of SFAS 115. See Note Four. -7-  8Part IItem 1. (continued)NOTE 4 - SECURITIESFor a discussion of the accounting policies relating to securities, see Note Oneof Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The amortized cost and estimated fair value of Chase's securities, including theimpact of related derivatives, are presented in the following table.(a) Gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were $1,381 million and $132 million, respectively, at September 30, 1998 and $386 million and $202 million, respectively, at December 31, 1997. Gross unrealized gains and losses on held-to-maturity securities were $24 million and $1 million, respectively, at September 30, 1998 and $16 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 1997.(b) Includes collateralized mortgage obligations of private issuers, which generally have underlying collateral consisting of obligations of U.S. Government and Federal agencies and corporations.(c) Excludes securities classified as loans, which are subject to the provisions of SFAS 115. The amortized cost and fair value of these loans, including the impact of related derivatives, were $650 million and $555 million, respectively, at September 30, 1998. This compares with $1,005 million and $982 million, respectively, at December 31, 1997.Net gains from available-for-sale securities sold in the third quarter of 1998amounted to $261 million (gross gains of $354 million and gross losses of $93million) and for the first nine months of 1998 amounted to $442 million (grossgains of $632 million and gross losses of $190 million). Net gains on sales ofthese types of securities for the same periods in 1997 amounted to $58 million(gross gains of $132 million and gross losses of $74 million) and $189 million(gross gains of $327 million and gross losses of $138 million), respectively.NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFor a discussion of legal proceedings, see Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. -8-  9Part IItem 1. (continued)NOTE 6 - GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CORPORATION'S JUNIORSUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURESFor a discussion of these business trusts, see page 58 of Chase's 1997 AnnualReport.The following is a summary of the outstanding capital securities, net ofdiscount, issued by each trust and the junior subordinated deferrable interestdebentures issued by Chase to each trust (which debentures are the sole assetsof each trust) as of September 30, 1998:(a) Represents the amount of capital securities issued to the public by each trust. These amounts are reflected as liabilities of Chase.(b) Represents the amount of Chase debentures held as assets by each trust. These amounts represent an intercompany transaction and are eliminated in Chase's consolidated financial statements.NOTE 7 - RESTRUCTURING COSTSDuring the 1998 first quarter, Chase incurred a one-time pre-tax charge of $510million in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions andrealign certain business activities. The majority of these costs relate toanticipated staff reductions of approximately 4,500 existing positions(approximately $338 million), costs in connection with planned dispositions ofcertain premises and equipment (approximately $144 million) and other expenses(approximately $28 million). As of September 30, 1998, the reserve balance was$424 million.There were no residual merger-related expenses incurred in the third quarter of1998 (compared with $71 million in the 1997 third quarter) relating to themerger of The Chase Manhattan Corporation and Chemical Banking Corporation. Forthe nine month period, merger-related expenses were $19 million in 1998 comparedwith $172 million in 1997. No further residual merger-related expenses areexpected to be taken by Chase.

This change in the risk-based guidelines had an immaterial impact on Chase's September 30, 1998 Total Capital ratio.NOTE 9 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFor a discussion of Chase's fair value methodologies, see Note Twenty-One of the1997 Annual Report. The following table presents the financial assets andliabilities valued under SFAS 107.Derivative contracts used for ALM activities had an unrecognized net gain of $26million at September 30, 1998 and an unrecognized net loss of $489 million atDecember 31, 1997, both of which are included in the above amounts.

Chase's actual results may differ materially from thoseincluded in these forward-looking statements. Reference is made to Chase'sreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the1997 Annual Report, for a discussion of factors that may cause such differencesto occur. See Glossary of Terms on page 41 for a definition of terms usedthroughout this Form 10-Q.OVERVIEWOperating net income for the 1998 third quarter was $738 million, compared with$1.08 billion in the same quarter of 1997. Diluted operating earnings per sharewere $0.82 for the third quarter of 1998, a decrease of 31% from the same 1997period. The 1998 third quarter reflected a difficult global market environment.During the 1998 third quarter: - National Consumer Services and Global Services businesses each reported double-digit revenue growth during the third quarter, which offset the 20% decline in Global Banking revenue. - Chase's risk management strategies, particularly its use of stress testing and value-at-risk, significantly reduced its potential market risk exposure. - Continued financial discipline resulted in a $10 billion reduction in assets on the balance sheet. At the same time, Chase was able to repurchase net $351 million of its common stock during the quarter and still increase its Tier 1 Capital ratio to 8.3%. - Chase continued its expense discipline, as demonstrated by a reduction in operating noninterest expenses by approximately $100 million, or 4%, from the second quarter of 1998.Operating net income for the 1998 first nine months decreased to $2.87 billionfrom $3.00 billion for the same 1997 period. Diluted operating earnings pershare were $3.20 for 1998, a slight decrease when compared with $3.22 for thesame 1997 nine month period.For the third quarter of 1998, reported net income was $837 million or $0.94 pershare on a diluted basis, compared with $982 million or $1.08 per share on adiluted basis for the 1997 third quarter. Special items in the third quarter of1998 included $191 million of pre-tax interest income ($123 million after tax),resulting from prior years' tax refunds, and a $37 million pre-tax charge ($24million after tax) for the accelerated vesting of stock-based awards.For the first nine months of 1998, reported net income was $2.64 billion or$2.93 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $2.83 billion or $3.04 pershare on a diluted basis for the same 1997 period. The results for the 1998first nine months reflected (in addition to the special items mentioned above) apreviously-announced, one-time charge of $510 million ($320 million after-tax)taken in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions and realigncertain business functions. For a reconciliation of operating earnings toreported net income, see page 19.Chase's exposure to Japan, Russia, and Latin America declined significantly overthe past nine months. See pages 28 and 29 for a discussion of Chase's hedge fundand cross-border exposure. -13-  14LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSAs of January 1, 1998, Chase adopted Shareholder Value Added (SVA) as itsprimary measure of business unit performance. SVA represents operating earningsexcluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles (i.e., cashoperating earnings) less an explicit charge for allocated capital. Additionalrefinements have been made to the methodology for the allocation of capital tothe various lines of business. Prior periods have been restated to reflect thesechanges. For a further discussion of Chase's line of business franchises and itscapital allocation method under SVA, see pages 21 and 24-25 of the 1997 AnnualReport.LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSManagement measures Chase's financial performance and that of its business unitsbased on operating earnings, which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations, restructuring costs and special items. See page 19 forreconciliation of reported results to operating results.(a) Only the global banking portion of Chase Texas is reported in the total Global Banking line of business results. The consumer- and global services-related results for Chase Texas are reported as part of National Consumer Services ("NCS") and Global Services lines of business results, respectively. Global Services are part of Chase Technology Solutions, see description on page 18.(b) Total column includes Corporate and the Information Technology and Operations and Electronic Commerce Initiatives portions of Chase Technology Solutions. See description of Chase Technology Solutions and Corporate on page 18.(c) Cash Operating Earnings represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles.Chase's financial performance goals over the next several years include anaverage return on common equity of 18% or higher, growth in operating revenuesaccelerating to 10% per year and double-digit growth in operating earnings pershare. -14-  15GLOBAL BANKINGGlobal Banking operating revenues declined $461 million, or 20%, in the 1998third quarter compared with the 1997 third quarter. Cash operating earnings andSVA decreased $302 million and $321 million, respectively, for the samecomparable period. A significant factor in the decline of third quarter revenueand earnings was the decrease in equity-related investment gains andtrading-related revenues. For the first nine months of 1998, operating revenuesrose $210 million, or 3%, due to higher investment banking fees. Cash operatingearnings and SVA for the first nine months of 1998 decreased $80 million and$132 million, respectively, reflecting higher incentive costs.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within Global Banking for the periods indicated.NM - Not MeaningfulGLOBAL MARKETSGlobal Markets' activities encompass the trading and sales of foreign exchange,derivatives, fixed income securities and commodities. Chase operates 24 hours aday covering the major international cross-border financial markets, as well asmany local markets, in both developed and emerging countries, and is arecognized world leader in such key activities as foreign exchange, interestrate swaps and emerging markets debt. Also included within Global Markets areChase's domestic and international treasury units, which have the primaryresponsibility for Chase's asset/liability management activities ("ALM"). ALMactivities in the treasury units are managed on a total return basis with one ofthe primary objectives being the creation of economic value over time. Totalreturn combines the reported revenues (net interest income and securitiesgains/losses) and the change in the net unrealized appreciation/depreciation ofall financial instruments and underlying balance sheet items.Trading-related revenue for the third quarter of 1998 was $259 million, adecrease of 60% from 1997 third quarter's results due to difficult global marketconditions, in particular the emerging markets of Asia, Russia and LatinAmerica. These conditions also contributed to a 20% decline in trading-relatedrevenue for the first nine months of 1998. This unfavorable impact was partiallyoffset by $261 million of securities gains realized during the 1998 thirdquarter representing a portion of the increased value in Chase'savailable-for-sale ("AFS") investment portfolio, which is managed as part ofChase's overall market risk management process. Remaining unrealized gains inChase's AFS investment portfolio were approximately $1 billion, before taxes, atSeptember 30, 1998. In the third quarter and first nine months of 1998, thetotal return (pre-tax before expenses) from ALM activities amounted to $342million and $513 million, respectively. The 1997 third quarter and first ninemonths amounts were $134 million and $557 million, respectively. -15-  16GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKINGGlobal Investment Banking finances and advises corporations, financialinstitutions, financial sponsors and governments by providing integratedone-stop financial solutions and industry expertise to clients globally. Clientindustry groups include chemicals, financial institutions, healthcare,insurance, media and telecommunications, multinationals, natural resources, oiland gas, power and environmental, real estate, retail, sports advisory andfinance, transportation and broker/dealers. The product offerings encompasssyndicated finance, high-yield securities, mergers and acquisitions advisory,project finance, real estate advisory and placement, restructuring and privateplacements. Chase continues to maintain its lead position in loan syndicationsand in leveraged finance. Operating revenues in the third quarter of 1998decreased $70 million, or 26%, to $205 million reflecting difficult high-yieldmarket conditions. For the first nine months of 1998, operating revenuesincreased by $278 million, or 41%, to $951 million when compared with the same1997 period. The 1998 nine month operating revenues reflect strong growth forall major business lines, including loan syndications, high-yield securities andmergers and acquisitions advisory activity.CORPORATE LENDINGCorporate Lending provides credit and lending services to clients globally. Theproduct offerings encompass global corporate lending, credit analysis and agentbank services for all industry groups. An active portfolio management effort isan integral part of corporate lending activities. Cash operating earnings in thethird quarter of 1998 rose $8 million or 6% and were flat for the first ninemonths of 1998 when compared with the same 1997 periods. The favorable thirdquarter 1998 results were driven by the accumulated effects of the intensivecapital management initiative, which has been in place since the first quarterof 1998. These initiatives have resulted in higher spreads on retained assetsand the disposition of less attractive loans.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERSChase Capital Partners ("CCP") is a global private equity organization withapproximately $6.7 billion under management, including $5.0 billion inequity-related investments. CCP provides equity and mezzanine financing in theUnited States and, to a lesser extent, abroad. During the first nine months of1998, CCP's direct investments approximated $1.2 billion in 84 venture capital,management buyout, recapitalization, growth equity and mezzanine transactions,compared with approximately $370 million in 68 direct investments during thesame period in 1997. The difficult market conditions that existed for the 1998third quarter resulted in unrealized mark-to-market losses on the investmentportfolio and contributed to CCP's cash operating loss of $35 million, a $159million decline from 1997. For the first nine months of 1998, cash operatingearnings rose $22 million, or 8%, to $316 million reflecting CCP's acceleratedpace of investment activities over the last several years.GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE BANKINGThe Global Asset Management and Private Banking Group serves a global clientbase of high net worth individuals and families, and institutional, mutual fundand self-directed investors. Services include investment management forinstitutional investors globally, Chase Vista Mutual Funds (at September 30,1998, the third largest bank-managed mutual fund family in the U.S.) and a fullrange of integrated private banking capabilities, investment management andadvisory services, trust and estate planning, global custody, global mutualfunds, credit and banking, and philanthropic advisory services. Total assetsunder management amounted to $181 billion at September 30, 1998. Earnings forthe first nine months of 1998 were driven by a 12% growth in revenue, benefitingfrom increased fee income, particularly related to private client trust andinvestment management activities, and the accelerating growth of Chase's assetmanagement and mutual fund businesses.MIDDLE MARKETChase is the premier provider of financial services to middle-market companies(companies with sales ranging from $10 million to $500 million) regionally, witha national focus in selected industries. It is also the market leader in the NewYork metropolitan tri-state area where it has relationships with 53% of middlemarket companies and is lead bank for 25% of these companies. Cash operatingearnings decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 1998 whencompared with the 1997 results reflecting lower spreads, an increase in expensesand lower securities gains.CHASE TEXASChase Texas is the primary bank for more large corporations and middle marketcompanies than any other bank in Texas. Chase Texas also maintains a strongconsumer banking presence through its 123 locations. Additionally, Chase Texasis the largest bank for personal and corporate trust services in the Southwest.Operating revenues increased 15% for the 1998 third quarter and 16% for thefirst nine months of 1998 when compared with the same periods in 1997,reflecting increased corporate finance fees, higher loan and deposit volumes,and securities gains.NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICES (NCS)Cash operating earnings for the 1998 third quarter was essentially flat withyear-ago levels and for the first nine months of 1998, NCS's cash operatingearnings increased $60 million or 7%, over the same 1997 period. The nine monthincrease in cash operating earnings is attributable to an 11% increase inrevenue due primarily to the acquisition of The Bank of New York's ("BONY")credit card portfolio in November 1997. NCS's expenses increased in 1998 as aresult of the BONY credit card acquisition, co-branded activities, and fromhigher volumes across all of the NCS businesses. Additionally, credit costsincreased for both 1998 periods primarily due to the BONY portfolio. SVA wasdown $44 million in the third quarter of 1998 and $56 million in the first ninemonths of 1998 due to increased capital allocation to NCS as a result of recentacquisitions, primarily the BONY portfolio. -16-  17Chase's National Consumer Services businesses are large, diverse and almosttotally domestic-based, providing counterbalance to Chase's global wholesalebusinesses. Chase believes that continued efforts to moderate expense growth,together with stable credit costs and continuing consolidation of these markets,will enable Chase to solidify its leadership positions in these businesses.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within NCS for the periods indicated.CARDMEMBER SERVICESChase Cardmember Services ("CCS") ranks as the fourth largest bank card issuerin the United States. CCS also reflects the results of Chase's internationalconsumer business, which includes Chase Manhattan Card Company Limited, thethird-largest credit card issuer in Hong Kong (which became wholly owned in1998), and includes consumer banking activities in Hong Kong, Panama and theEastern Caribbean. At September 30, 1998, CCS had a $32 billion worldwidemanaged credit card portfolio. CCS's operating revenues for the third quarter of1998 were $979 million, a $139 million or 16% increase, while cash operatingearnings were $104 million, a $6 million or 5% decrease, compared with 1997,reflecting the anticipated effect of charge-offs from the BONY portfolio.Earnings for the first nine months of 1998 rose 30% to $345 million. Theincrease was driven by 19% revenue growth reflecting the aforementioned BONYacquisition and increased co-branded activities. These positive results werepartially offset by increased charge-offs and the effect of the economicenvironment in Asia on Chase's international consumer businesses.REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKINGAt September 30, 1998, Regional Consumer Banking has a leading share of primarybank relationships among consumers and small businesses in the New Yorkmetropolitan tri-state area. It is also a leading retail institution in keyTexas markets. Regional Consumer Banking offers customers convenient access tofinancial services through the largest branch and proprietary ATM networks inthe New York metropolitan region plus state-of-the-art telephone, PC andInternet services. Cash operating earnings for the 1998 third quarter rose $6million or 7% to $97 million reflecting higher fee income from product andpricing initiatives. For the first nine months of 1998, cash operating earningswere 3% lower when compared with 1997, reflecting higher expenses related tosystems integration and enhancements, particularly within Chase Texas' retailbusinesses.CHASE HOME FINANCEAt September 30, 1998, Chase Home Finance is the third-largest originator andfourth-largest servicer of residential first mortgage loans in the U.S. It isalso a leading provider of home-equity secured lending and manufactured housingfinancing. Chase Home Finance serves more than 2 million customers nationwide.At September 30, 1998, Chase's residential first mortgage servicing portfoliototaled $184 billion. During the first nine months of 1998, $54 billion inresidential first mortgage loans were originated, which was a 96% increase overthe same period last year. Cash operating earnings increased 3% in the 1998third quarter and 4% for the first nine months of 1998, when compared with thesame periods in 1997. Operating revenues improved in 1998 benefiting from asignificantly higher volume of mortgage originations partially offset by theimpact of higher levels of prepayments on the loan servicing and mortgageportfolio. -17-  18DIVERSIFIED CONSUMER SERVICESDiversified Consumer Services ("DCS") is the largest bank originator of autoloans and leases in the United States, and a leading provider of student loansand unsecured consumer lending. In addition to its financing activities, DCSoffers brokerage services and investment products nationwide and is one of themost diversified bank insurance providers in the U.S. At September 30, 1998,Chase Auto Finance had $14 billion in retained outstandings with $9 billion innew originations for the nine months of 1998. Cash operating earnings rose $9million or 19% in the 1998 third quarter and $11 million or 8% for the firstnine months of 1998 reflecting the continued growth in Chase's auto finance,insurance and consumer investment businesses.CHASE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSChase Technology Solutions ("CTS") combines Chase's Global Services businesses,Information Technology and Operations, and Electronic Commerce initiatives intoa single group. Global Services is a leading provider of information andtransaction services globally and includes custody, cash management, trust andother fiduciary services. As the world's largest provider of global custody anda leader in trust and agency services, Global Services was custodian for over$4.8 trillion in assets and serviced over $3 trillion in outstanding debt atSeptember 30, 1998. Global Services also operates the largest U.S. dollar fundstransfer business in the world and is a market leader in FedWire, ACH and CHIPSvolume. Cash operating earnings for Global Services in the third quarter of 1998were $122 million, an increase of $10 million or 9% from the 1997 third quarter.For the first nine months of 1998, cash operating earnings increased $51 millionor 17% from the same 1997 period. SVA for Global Services in the 1998 thirdquarter and the first nine months of 1998 increased $10 million and $52 million,respectively, when compared with the same 1997 periods. These improvementsresulted from revenue growth across all three businesses within Global Services(Chase Treasury Solutions, Global Investor Services and Global Trust),reflecting increased balances, new business initiatives and market appreciation,as well as higher fees resulting from an acquisition in the fourth quarter of1997. Earnings also benefited from continued productivity gains, tempered bytechnology investments related to preparations for Year 2000 and EuropeanMonetary Union ("EMU") initiatives.CORPORATECorporate includes the effects remaining at the Corporate level after theimplementation of management accounting policies, including residual creditprovision and tax expense. Corporate also includes unallocated special items.For the third quarter of 1998, Corporate had a cash operating loss (includingthe non-Global Services portion of CTS) of $74 million compared with a cashoperating loss of $51 million in 1997. For the first nine months of 1998,Corporate had a cash operating loss of $225 million compared with a cashoperating loss of $130 million in 1997. -18-  19RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING RESULTSThe following supplemental information provides a reconciliation between Chase'sreported results and results on an operating basis.(a) Represents results as reported in Chase's financial statements, except restructuring costs have been separately displayed and foreclosed property expense is included in credit costs.(b) Represents the impact of credit card securitizations. For the third quarter, the line items on the income statement impacted are net interest income ($374 million in 1998 and $319 million in 1997), provision for credit losses ($298 million in 1998 and $249 million in 1997), credit card revenue ($69 million in 1998 and $58 million in 1997) and other revenue ($7 million in 1998 and $12 million in 1997). For the first nine months, the line items on the income statement impacted are net interest income ($1,093 million in 1998 and $913 million in 1997), provision for credit losses ($864 million in 1998 and $730 million in 1997), credit card revenue ($222 million in 1998 and $152 million in 1997) and other revenue ($7 million in 1998 and $31 million in 1997).(c) Includes restructuring costs and special items. Restructuring costs for the first nine months of 1998 reflect the $510 million pre-tax charge ($320 million after-tax) taken in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions, and residual costs of $19 million pre-tax ($13 million after-tax) related to the merger restructuring charge. For a description of special items, see the Glossary of Terms on page 41. -19-  20To facilitate analysis of Chase's financial results, management categorizescertain revenue components of the operating income statement as market-sensitiverevenues. Chase's market-sensitive revenues include trading revenues (includingtrading-related net interest income), investment banking fees, securities gainsand revenue from equity-related investments.Over the past ten years (1988-1997), Chase's market sensitive revenues havegrown at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 14%. However,market-sensitive revenues are affected by many factors. These include Chase'scredit standing and its success in proprietary positioning, as well as generaleconomic conditions (both domestic and international), the fiscal policies ofcentral banks and governments which affect the financial markets (includingdomestic and foreign interest rates), the volatility of interest rates, equityand debt markets and currencies (including volatility associated with theintroduction of the euro), and other political, social and economicdevelopments.Chase's market-sensitive revenues will, therefore, experience volatility fromtime to time. This was demonstrated during 1998. After achieving higher thanhistorical growth rates in the first two quarters of 1998, market-sensitiverevenues declined during the third quarter by approximately $500 million fromthe second quarter of 1998 and approximately $360 million from the third quarterof 1997, to a level below that implied by the long-term growth rate. The thirdquarter decline resulted primarily from lower gains in private-equityinvestments and lower trading revenues. There are, however, more stable revenuestreams within market-sensitive revenues such as transaction-related revenuefrom the trading businesses.Chase expects market-sensitive revenues to continue to grow at a CAGR ofapproximately 14%, although results in any particular quarter may be better orworse than the level implied by this long-term growth rate, depending on thefactors described above.All other revenue captions are generally subject to less market volatility.Certain components of these revenue captions are subject to market volatility,particularly assets that are held-for-sale and are accounted for on either amark-to-market basis or lower of cost or market basis. All other revenuesincreased by 6% in the 1998 third quarter and 7% for the 1998 first nine months,when compared with the same 1997 periods. The increases were the result ofhigher trust, custody and investment management fees and credit card revenue.REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below discusses Chase's reported results of operations. Reportedresults include the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costsand special items.NET INTEREST INCOMEbp - Denotes basis pointsReported net interest income for the 1998 third quarter was $2,206 million andfor the first nine months of 1998 was $6,406 million. Excluding the impact of$191 million of interest income resulting from prior years' tax refunds whichwere recognized in the 1998 third quarter, net interest income decreased 3% forthe quarter and increased 1% for the first nine months from comparable 1997periods. Excluding the impact of the tax refund, the net yield oninterest-earning assets declined 3 basis points during the 1998 third quarterand 11 basis points during the first nine months of 1998 from comparable 1997periods. This was primarily due to generally narrower spreads on loans. -20-  21Average interest-earning assets retained on the balance sheet decreased slightlyin the third quarter of 1998 but increased 5% in the first nine months of 1998when compared with the same 1997 periods. Loan and securities volume increasedin both periods, offset by a decline in liquid assets. Average loans retained onthe balance sheet increased $4.9 billion in the 1998 third quarter and $11.2billion in the first nine months of 1998, when compared with the same periods in1997. The increase in average loans retained was divided between the domesticconsumer and commercial portfolios, while the increase in securities wasprincipally in the domestic available-for-sale portfolio. The foreign commercialloan portfolio declined in the 1998 third quarter as Chase continued to reduceits exposure to emerging markets. Interest-earning assets in both 1998 periodswere funded by a higher percentage of deposits than in the comparable 1997periods, a reflection of liquidity within the consumer sector.PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSESChase's provision for credit losses, which equaled net charge-offs, amounted to$455 million in the 1998 third quarter and $1,137 million for the first ninemonths of 1998, compared with $190 million and $599 million, respectively, forthe prior-year periods. For a discussion of Chase's net charge-offs, see theCredit Risk Management Section on pages 26-31.As a result of increased charge-offs from the foreign commercial portfolio,particularly Asia and Russia, the provision for credit losses for full-year 1998will be higher than the full-year 1997 provision.NONINTEREST REVENUEThe 1998 third quarter and the 1998 first nine months continued to benefit fromChase's diversified revenue streams with strong increases in several areas(notably securities gains, investment banking fees, trust fees and credit cardrevenue). The difficult global market conditions resulted in significantdeclines in trading and equity-related revenues for the third quarter.Investment banking fees of $322 million in the 1998 third quarter and $1,121million for the 1998 first nine months were higher by 5% and 46%, respectively,than the same 1997 periods. In the 1998 third quarter, strong growth in feeincome from loan syndications and merger and acquisition advisory activity wasoffset by reduced underwriting fees in high yield and emerging markets. The ninemonths' results reflect revenue growth in all major business lines, inparticular investment-grade bond underwriting, loan syndications, and mergersand acquisitions advisory activity. -21-  22(a) For the definitions of the above captions, see page 26 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.Trust, custody and investment management fees continued their record settingpace by rising 18% to a new record of $398 million in the 1998 third quarter,and by increasing 17% to $1,129 million in the first nine months. Thesefavorable results were largely attributable to growth in assets under custody,expanded securities lending activity, a higher level of assets under management(including at the Chase Vista mutual funds which grew 30% from the 1997 thirdquarter to $42 billion at the end of the 1998 third quarter), as well as fromportfolio acquisitions.Credit card revenue rose $100 million, or 36%, in the 1998 third quarter and$280 million, or 37%, in the 1998 first nine months as a result of continuedgrowth in managed credit card receivables, including the acquisition of BONY'scredit card portfolio in late 1997, and increased co-branded activities. Theincreases in revenue were partially offset by a rise in net charge-offs on thesecuritized portfolio, which reduced the excess servicing fees Chase receivedfrom the securitizations. Average managed worldwide credit card receivables grewto $31.6 billion in the third quarter of 1998, compared with $27.6 billion forthe prior year's third quarter. For a further discussion of the credit cardportfolio, see page 27 of this Form 10-Q.(a) Insurance amount excludes certain insurance fees related to credit cards and mortgage products, which are included in those revenue captions.The rise in fees in lieu of compensating balances reflects, in part, higher feesfor services paid by customers, rather than customers maintaining a higher levelof compensating balances in the current lower interest-rate environment.Mortgage servicing fees declined in both the 1998 third quarter and first ninemonths largely due to the impact of prepayments as a result of a lowerinterest-rate environment; however, lower interest rates benefited mortgageoriginations and sales revenues, which are reported in other revenues, asdiscussed on page 23 of this Form 10-Q. The higher level of loan commitment feesfor the first nine months of 1998 was largely a reflection of increased activityin Chase's acquisition financing business. Higher fees related to insuranceproducts, investment services, and loans serviced (notably auto loans), alsocontributed to the increase. -22-  23(a) For a definition of trading-related net interest income and the classes of financial instruments included, see Note Two of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.Total trading revenues were $259 million for the 1998 third quarter, a 60%decline from the 1997 third quarter and a 50% decline from the 1998 secondquarter. Total trading revenues for the first nine months of 1998 were down 20%from the same 1997 period.Interest rate contract revenues declined for both periods, mainly due to weakerresults in the U.S., especially in several structured products. The rise inforeign exchange revenue reflected strong earnings across a broad spectrum ofcurrencies, with particular emphasis on the Asian markets where volatilitycontinued to remain high. The decline in debt instruments and other revenue wasattributable to weak markets in Asia, Russia and Latin America.Securities gains realized for the 1998 third quarter were $261 million and forthe 1998 first nine months were $442 million. These gains were largely fromsales of U.S. Government and agency securities. Due to the adverse marketconditions during the 1998 third quarter, many investors chose saferinvestments, such as U.S. Treasuries. Remaining unrealized gains in Chase's AFSsecurities portfolio were approximately $1 billion, before taxes, at September30, 1998, up from approximately $150 million, before taxes, three months ago.Chase's AFS portfolio is managed as part of its overall risk management processand a portion of the unrealized gains in the securities portfolio may beconsidered as an economic offset to its trading portfolio.Revenue from equity-related investments includes income from a wide variety ofinvestments in the United States and, to a lesser extent, abroad. The 1998 thirdquarter results of $60 million were unfavorably impacted by the volatility ofthe global markets and were 76% lower than the prior year's quarter andsignificantly lower than the quarterly average of approximately $224 million forthe previous eight quarters. For the first nine months of 1998, these resultsincreased 20% to $723 million reflecting the benefit of Chase's accelerated paceof investment activities over the last several years as well as the favorablemarket conditions during the first six months of 1998. At September 30, 1998,Chase's equity-related investments under management approximated $5.0 billion.The 1998 third quarter and first nine months results included higher revenuefrom residential mortgage originations and portfolio sales activities, areflection of the continued favorable lower interest-rate environment.Contributing to the decline in all other revenue in both 1998 periods was a netunrealized loss from marking to market a loan and securities portfolio that hasbeen previously transferred into a trust, the shares of which are being sold toinstitutional investors. The 1997 first nine months results included a $44million gain on the sale of a partially-owned foreign investment. The 1997 thirdquarter and first nine months also included $16 million and $48 million,respectively, of equity income from Chase's investment in CIT Group Holdings,Inc. (Chase's remaining 20% interest in CIT was sold in the fourth quarter of1997). -23-  24NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expenses, excluding restructuring costs, were $2,647 million in the1998 third quarter, an increase of 2% from the prior year's quarter, and were$7,981 million for the first nine months of 1998, an increase of 7% from thesame 1997 period. The increase for both 1998 periods reflects operating costsrelated to portfolio acquisitions, investment spending on new product offeringsand Year 2000, EMU and other technology spending. Noninterest expenses includingrestructuring costs were $8,510 million for the first nine months of 1998, anincrease of 12% from the 1997 first nine months.(a) Excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed property expense, costs associated with the REIT and special items.(b) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.The decrease in salaries for the 1998 third quarter substantially reflectedlower incentive costs. The increase in salaries for the first nine months of1998, and the increase in employee benefits for both 1998 periods was primarilydue to the net addition of approximately 3,000 full-time equivalent employees.The increased head count reflects the net impact of investments in selectedgrowth businesses (including through acquisitions), less staff reductionsrelated to initiatives to streamline support functions and realign certainbusiness activities. Included in the 1998 and 1997 nine month results were $37million and $135 million ($85 million in the third quarter), respectively, forthe accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards.The higher level of equipment expense during the 1998 third quarter and firstnine months was due to an increase in depreciation expense from recentlycapitalized equipment across all business units. The 1998 third quarter andfirst nine months were also impacted by increased software expense related toYear 2000 and EMU efforts. For a further discussion of Year 2000 and EMUefforts, see the Operating Risk Management Section on page 34. -24-  25Other expense for the 1998 third quarter and first nine months increased $92million and $270 million, respectively, when compared with the third quarter andfirst nine months of 1997. Professional services costs for both 1998 periodsreflected higher levels of contract computer professionals associated with Year2000 and the EMU efforts. The $18 million increase in marketing expense in the1998 third quarter is primarily due to higher marketing acquisition costs atChase Cardmember Services. The $13 million rise in telecommunications costs inthe 1998 third quarter and $33 million increase for the first nine months of1998 covers both installation and usage and reflects the growth in businessvolume at all of Chase's major business franchises. The purchase of the BONYcredit card portfolio in late 1997 contributed to the increase in amortizationof intangibles expense, while the increased servicing costs for the portfoliocontributed to the increase in all other expense. These increases were partiallyoffset by a decline in minority interest expense due to the acquisition ofminority interest in a foreign investment in the 1998 first quarter.For a discussion of Chase's restructuring costs, see Note Seven on page 9 ofthis Form 10-Q. It is anticipated that the annual savings from the one-timecharge of $510 million, taken in the first quarter of 1998 in connection withinitiatives to streamline support functions and realign certain businessfunctions, will amount to approximately $460 million. Depending on its view ofrevenue opportunities, Chase may or may not reinvest all or a part of theseexpense savings in its revenue-generating activities.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $462 million in the third quarter of 1998compared with $576 million in the third quarter of 1997. The effective tax ratefor each period was 35.6% and 37.0%, respectively. For the first nine months,Chase recorded income tax expense of $1.52 billion in 1998, compared with $1.69billion in 1997, at an effective tax rate of 36.5% and 37.3%, respectively. -25-  26CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1997 and should be read in conjunction withpages 29-37 and 52 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans secured by mortgages on 1-4 family residential properties.(b) Total managed loans, at September 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997 were $185,544 million and $185,306 million, respectively. -26-  27CREDIT PORTFOLIO SUMMARYThe decrease at September 30, 1998 in retained loans outstanding from December31, 1997 levels is the result of slight decreases in both the consumer andcommercial loan portfolios. Based upon industry classifications utilized byChase, there were no commercial and industrial industry segments that exceeded5% of total commercial and industrial loans outstanding. During the 1998 thirdquarter, exposures to Asia and Latin America continued to decrease.Chase's nonperforming assets at September 30, 1998 increased $515 million fromthe 1997 year-end level primarily due to an increase in nonperforming Asianassets. Management expects that during the remainder of 1998, there will be anincrease in nonperforming assets from the September 30, 1998 level, primarily asa result of continuing uncertainty in the financial conditions of certain Asiancountries.Total net charge-offs on a retained basis increased by $265 million during the1998 third quarter and by $538 million for the first nine months, when comparedto the same 1997 periods. Total net charge-offs on a managed basis were $753million in the 1998 third quarter, compared with $439 million in the thirdquarter of 1997. For the first nine months of 1998, total net charge-offs on amanaged basis were $2,001 million, compared with $1,329 million in 1997. Theincreases in net charge-offs on both a managed and retained basis are due to thegenerally lower credit quality of the BONY credit card portfolio, a factor whichwas anticipated at the time of its acquisition, and increased foreign commercialcharge-offs, primarily as a result of conditions in Asia and Russia.Commercial net charge-offs totaled $200 million during the 1998 third quarter.Net recoveries of $62 million in the domestic commercial portfolio were offsetby net charge-offs in the foreign commercial portfolio. Approximately 80% of theforeign commercial net charge-offs related to Russia. For the nine months endedSeptember 30, 1998, commercial net charge-offs of $370 million represented netrecoveries of approximately $86 million in the domestic commercial portfolio,offset by net charge-offs of $456 million in Chase's foreign commercialportfolio.CONSUMER PORTFOLIOResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $39.3 billion atSeptember 30, 1998, a $570 million increase from year-end, reflecting increasedorigination activity due to lower interest rates. At September 30, 1998,nonperforming domestic residential mortgage loans, as a percentage of thedomestic residential mortgage loan portfolio, was 0.87%, down slightly from the1997 year-end level.Credit Card Loans: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managed basis,which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well as creditcard receivables that have been securitized.The following table presents credit-related information for Chase's aggregatedomestic and international managed credit card receivables.(a) For the three months ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 and for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, Chase's average domestic managed credit card receivables were $31.0 billion, $27.1 billion, $31.4 billion and $26.0 billion, respectively. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average domestic managed credit card receivables for each of these periods were 6.27%, 5.57%, 6.01% and 5.74%, respectively.The increases in average managed credit card receivables for both the three andnine month periods ended September 30, 1998, when compared with the same periodsin 1997, were largely the result of the purchase of a domestic credit cardportfolio in late 1997, totaling approximately $4.0 billion in outstandings. Theincrease in the net charge-off percentage for both 1998 periods is due to theanticipated lower credit quality of the BONY portfolio and to a decrease ingrowth of credit card outstandings driven by increased consumer liquidity.Management expects that credit card net charge-offs, as a percentage of averagemanaged credit card receivables, will increase in 1998 when compared with 1997. -27-  28Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased 11% reflecting continuedstrong consumer demand due to favorable pricing programs, partially offset bythe impact of auto loan securitizations. Total originations were $9.0 billion inthe first nine months of 1998, compared with $8.2 billion in the same 1997period. Net charge-offs related to auto financings increased in the 1998 thirdquarter and in the first nine months, compared with the same 1997 periods. Theincreased level of net charge-offs for both 1998 periods primarily reflectsgrowth in the portfolio. The 1998 first nine months also includes theunfavorable performance in a discontinued product line.COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIODomestic Commercial: The domestic commercial portfolio had net recoveries duringthe 1998 third quarter and the portfolio continued to maintain its strong creditquality.Foreign Commercial: The foreign commercial portfolio totaled $34.3 billion atSeptember 30, 1998, a decrease of $4.4 billion from the 1997 year-end as Chasecontinued to reduce its exposure to emerging markets in Asia and Latin America.Nonperforming loan levels at September 30, 1998, as well as net charge-offlevels for the 1998 third quarter and first nine months, increased in comparisonwith the respective prior year periods, due to financial conditions in Asia andRussia.Total nonperforming assets in Asia, including derivatives, increased by $263million from 1997 year-end to $345 million at September 30, 1998. Asiancommercial net charge-offs, including derivatives, for the 1998 third quarterwere $52 million and for the first nine months of 1998 were $266 million,compared with $11 million and $13 million, respectively, in the same 1997periods. Russian-related commercial net charge-offs, including derivatives, were$208 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 1998. Of thisamount, $109 million were net charge-offs on resale agreements. There were noRussian-related commercial net charge-offs in the same 1997 periods.DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instrumentsutilized in connection with Chase's trading and ALM activities, see pages 35-36and Notes One and Eighteen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. At September 30, 1998,the majority of these transactions were with commercial bank and financialinstitution counterparties, most of which are dealers in these products. Thefollowing table provides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreignexchange contracts outstanding at September 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997. Thelengthening of the maturity profile since year-end is the result of the improvedcreditworthiness of Chase over the last several years (as evidenced by creditrating upgrades) and the maturation of the derivatives market where longermaturities are becoming more commonplace.Chase's net charge-offs arising from derivative and foreign exchangetransactions were $108 million in the 1998 third quarter and $130 million forthe first nine months of 1998. There were no net charge-offs on these types oftransactions during the first nine months of 1997. At September 30, 1998,nonperforming derivative contracts were $19 million, compared with none in 1997.The increases in both net charge-offs and nonperforming derivative contractswere due to the financial conditions in Asia and Russia.HEDGE FUNDSThe following table presents Chase's credit exposure to hedge funds at September30, 1998.(a) Includes loans, resale agreements, mark-to-market foreign exchange and derivative contracts and undrawn commitments to extend credit. -28-  29In addition to its credit exposure to hedge funds, Chase has made a $300 millioninvestment in Long-Term Capital Management and had, at September 30, 1998,approximately $400 million invested in other hedge funds, with no singleinvestment larger than $25 million at the time the investment was made. Theseother investments are marked-to-market and have produced a year-to-date return of negative four percent.CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURECredits denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which aborrower is located, such as dollar-denominated loans made overseas, are called"cross-border" credits. The financial turmoil in Asia and Latin America, whichstarted in July 1997, affected many countries where Chase has had long-standingcommercial and investment banking relationships. The following table presentsChase's cross-border exposure to Asian and Latin American countries. For afurther discussion of Chase's cross-border exposure, see pages 34-35 of Chase's1997 Annual Report.(a) Cross-border disclosure is based on Chase's credit-risk management policies in assessing Chase's cross-border risk.(b) Includes loans and accrued interest, interest-bearing deposits with banks, trading debt and equity instruments, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit, undrawn commitments to extend credit and local currency assets, net of local currency liabilities.(c) Foreign exchange largely represents the mark-to-market exposure of spot and forward contracts. Derivatives largely represent the mark-to-market exposure of risk management instruments. Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the value of a foreign exchange or derivative contract in the open market. The impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements on these foreign exchange and derivative contracts reduced exposure by $16.7 billion at September 30, 1998 and $12.7 billion at December 31, 1997.(d) Approximately $1.2 billion of the aggregate exposure represents resale agreements with investment grade counterparties from G-7 (Group of 7) countries. G-7 countries are the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, France, and Canada.(e) Excludes Bermuda and Cayman Islands. -29-  30In addition, at September 30, 1998, Chase had approximately $200 million in theaggregate of lending and foreign exchange/derivative related exposure to Russia,a decline of over $250 million from August 31, 1998. Chase also hadapproximately $450 million in resale agreements collateralized by non-rubledenominated Russian debt at September 30, 1998.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe following discussion of Chase's allowance for credit losses focusesprimarily on developments since December 31, 1997 and should be read inconjunction with pages 36-37 and Note Five of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The accompanying tables reflect: the activity in and composition of Chase'sallowance for credit losses; and certain coverage ratios related to theallowance for credit losses on loans, and on derivative and foreign exchangecontracts for the periods indicated.(a) The increase in the aggregate allowance from the September 30, 1997 level is due in large part to the acquisition of the Bank of New York credit card portfolio in late 1997.(b) During the third quarter of 1998, the allowance for credit losses on derivatives and foreign exchange contracts was increased by $75 million through the provision for credit losses, in response to the adverse market conditions in Asia and Russia. The total provision for credit losses relating to trading activities was $183 million for the third quarter of 1998. -30-  31The allowance for credit losses provides for risks of losses inherent in thecredit extension process for loans, derivative and foreign exchange financialinstruments and lending-related commitments. Chase deems its allowance forcredit losses at September 30, 1998 to be adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorblosses that may currently exist for all credit activities, but are not yetidentifiable). Estimating potential future losses is inherently uncertain anddepends on many factors, including general macroeconomic and politicalconditions, rating migration, structural changes within industries which altercompetitive positions, event risk, unexpected correlations within the portfolio,and other external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements. Chaseperiodically reviews such factors and reassesses the adequacy of the allowancefor credit losses.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1997 and should be read in conjunction withpages 37-41 and Notes One and Eighteen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.Chase uses both historic simulation and Monte Carlo statistical techniques toestimate a daily value-at-risk ("VAR"). The VAR calculation is performed for allmaterial trading portfolios and market risk-related ALM portfolios, with resultsreported by business unit and in the aggregate. The total VAR for Chase'strading portfolio and market risk-related ALM portfolio as of or for thetwelve-month period ended September 30, 1998 were as follows:NM: Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect.Chase's average aggregate VAR (VAR for both trading and ALM activities) for thetwelve-month period ended September 30, 1998 was $54.0 million. Chase'saggregate VAR at September 30, 1998 was $50.5 million. Chase's aggregate averageand period-end VARs are less than the sum of the respective trading and ALM VARsshown in the above table (by $21.9 million and $33.3 million, respectively) dueto risk offsets, resulting from portfolio diversification which occurs acrossthe trading and ALM portfolios. -31-  32Both for regulatory compliance with the Basle Committee on Banking Supervisionmarket risk capital rules and for internal evaluation of VAR, Chase conductsdaily backtesting of its VAR against trading revenues. For mark-to-marketactivities, there were two days in the third quarter of 1998 in which a dailytrading loss exceeded that day's VAR.Management believes stress tests are an essential complement to VAR. At Chase,stress tests are an integral part of an effective risk management process, andhave assumed an equal standing to VAR as a risk measurement and controltechnique for market risk. As of September 30, 1998, Chase's corporate monthlystress tests consist of five historical and three hypothetical scenarios for allmaterial trading portfolios and market risk-related ALM portfolios. SinceDecember 31, 1997, stress test results have been incorporated into Chase'sinternal capital allocation methodology, which provides a significant incentivefor active management of aggregate exposures to difficult market environments.TRADING ACTIVITIESThe following chart contains a histogram of Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of marked-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income. [Graphic of Daily Changes in Market Risk-Related Trading Revenue - See Appendix 1]Based on actual trading results for the twelve months ended September 30, 1998,Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 210 out of 259business trading days, with 48 business days exceeding positive $20 million overthe past twelve months. Chase incurred ten daily trading losses in excess ofnegative $20 million over the past twelve months. Five of these ten days oflosses occurred in late August and September 1998 and resulted from the adversemarket conditions which occurred in the third quarter.ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTMeasuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: Chase, as part of its ALM process, employsa variety of cash (primarily securities) and derivatives instruments in managingits exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. In managing exposure,Chase uses quantifications of net gap exposure and measurements of earnings atrisk (the risk to earnings from adverse movements in interest rates) based onearnings simulations. An example of aggregate net gap analysis is presentedbelow. -32-  33CONDENSED INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY TABLEAt September 30, 1998, Chase had $24.5 billion more liabilities than assetsrepricing within one year (including the net repricing effects of derivativepositions) or 7% of total assets. This compares with $17.8 billion moreliabilities than assets repricing within one year, or 5% of total assets, atDecember 31, 1997. This negative gap (more liabilities repricing than assets)will benefit earnings in a declining interest rate environment and will detractfrom earnings in a rising interest rate environment.At September 30, 1998, based on Chase's simulation model and applying immediateincreases in various market interest rates (100 bp increase for USdollar-denominated positions and a range from 100 bp to 1500 bp increases fornon-US dollar-denominated positions), earnings at risk over the next twelvemonths are estimated to be approximately 3.1% of projected 1998 after-tax income(before restructuring costs). Chase's earnings at risk to an immediate rise ininterest rates was estimated to be approximately 3.5% of after-tax net income atDecember 31, 1997. The hypothetical rate shocks are used to calibrate risk thatChase believes to be reasonably possible of occurring in the near-term, butthese scenarios do not necessarily represent management's current view of futuremarket developments.Impact of ALM Derivative Activity:The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's ALM activities at September 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997.(a) These net unrecognized gains/(losses) do not include the net unfavorable/(favorable) impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 41-43 and NoteSeventeen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.CAPITALChase's capital levels at September 30, 1998 remained well in excess ofregulatory guidelines. At September 30, 1998, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratioswere 8.3% and 12.1%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.6%. AtSeptember 30, 1998, the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 andTier 2 Capital) was $34.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31,1997. This increase for the first nine months of 1998 reflects retained earnings(net income less common and preferred dividends) generated during the period,plus the issuance of $448 million (net of discount) of capital securities issuedby certain Chase subsidiaries (see Note Six of this Form 10-Q) and the issuanceof $200 million of fixed/adjustable rate noncumulative preferred stock. Theincrease was partially offset by the redemption during the same period of $912million of preferred stock bearing higher dividend rates. -33-  34In the first quarter of 1998, Chase raised the cash dividend on its Common Stockto $.36 per share from $.31 per share. Chase has over the past several yearsbeen paying a common stock dividend that has generally been equal toapproximately 25% to 35% of Chase's operating net income, less the amount ofpreferred stock dividends. Chase's future dividend policies will be determinedby its Board of Directors taking into consideration Chase's earnings andfinancial condition and applicable governmental regulation and policies.From inception of a stock buyback program authorized by Chase's Board ofDirectors in October 1996 through September 30, 1998, Chase repurchased 82.5million shares of its Common Stock ($4.2 billion) and reissued from treasuryapproximately 46.6 million shares of its Common Stock ($2.1 billion) under itsbenefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of 35.9 million shares ($2.1billion).Management is committed to maintaining a disciplined capital policy for Chase.That policy is intended to increase SVA, to employ capital to support growth,including through acquisitions or other investment opportunities, and to returnexcess capital to stockholders. During the third quarter of 1998, Chase's Tier 1capital ratio rose to 8.3%. During the same period, Chase repurchased net 7.4million shares (net $351 million) of common stock under its buyback program.Management intends to continue Chase's disciplined approach to asset growth andmaintain Chase's Tier 1 capital ratio within its target range of 8% - 8.25%.Capital generated in excess of this target ratio will be used for continuedpurchases of Chase's common stock or for future reinvestment and acquisitionopportunities, including previously announced acquisitions that will close inthe fourth quarter.LIQUIDITYChase manages its liquidity in order to ensure the availability of sufficientcash flows to meet all of Chase's financial commitments and to capitalize onopportunities for Chase's business expansion. Chase is an active participant inthe capital markets and issues commercial paper, medium-term notes, long-termdebt, and common and preferred stock. During the first nine months of 1998,Chase issued $200 million of preferred stock and redeemed $912 million ofhigher-coupon preferred stock, and issued $448 million (net of discount) ofcapital securities through its subsidiaries. During the same period, Chaseissued $2.1 billion of long-term debt, offsetting $644 million of long-term debtthat matured and $663 million that was redeemed. During the third quarter of1998, $140 million of 10.5% cumulative preferred stock was redeemed, $248million (net of discount) of capital securities were issued through itssubsidiaries, and $75 million of long-term debt was issued (during the sameperiod $78 million of long-term debt matured and $235 million was redeemed).Chase constantly evaluates the opportunities to redeem its outstanding debt andpreferred stock and to issue new debt and preferred stock in light of currentmarket conditions.OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENTYEAR 2000 AND EMU: For a discussion of Chase's Year 2000 and the EMU efforts,see pages 28-29 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. The information below updatesChase's Year 2000 and EMU disclosures:YEAR 2000Overview: Chase recognized the need to create a coordinated approach to managingthe Year 2000 problem in mid-1995, when it established an enterprise-wideprogram to provide strong, comprehensive management of the issue. A Year 2000Enterprise Program Office, together with 34 business area project offices,coordinates, manages and monitors all aspects of the Year 2000 effort on aglobal basis, both technical- and business-related. The Program Office reportsdirectly to the Executive Committee of Chase and is responsible for Chase's Year2000 efforts. In addition, a Year 2000 Core Team, consisting of senior managersfrom internal audit, technology risk and control, financial management, thetechnology infrastructure division, legal and the Year 2000 Enterprise ProgramOffice, provides independent oversight of the process. The Core Team, which alsoreports directly to the Executive Committee of Chase, is charged withidentifying key risks and ensuring necessary management attention for timelyresolution of project issues. The Core Team reviews progress on a monthly basisand conducts formal quarterly reviews of all project offices. -34-  35Chase's Year 2000 Program initially focused on technology assessment andplanning, and the upgrading of internal systems; as these milestones werereached, the Program has shifted towards mitigating external sources of businessrisk, internal and external testing and contingency planning.Current Status: Chase's Year 2000 Program is tracked against a well-defined setof milestones. During its inventory and assessment phases, which were completedon schedule on September 30, 1997, Chase identified hardware and software thatrequired modification, developed implementation plans, prioritized tasks andestablished implementation time frames. The scope of Chase's Year 2000 Programinvolves (i) approximately 180,000 technical infrastructure components (e.g. LANservers and data center equipment) ("TICs"); (ii) approximately 3,900 businesssoftware applications (of which approximately 1,000 are provided by third-partyvendors) ("Software Applications"); (iii) 1,400 locations worldwide, at which upto 21 building systems at each location are being assessed ("Facility Systems");and (iv) over 77,000 desktops ("Desktop Systems").During the second quarter of 1998, Chase reached a major Program milestone: Year2000 compliance of its technical infrastructure and systems software. Thismilestone was met with 97% of Chase's identified TICs being made Year 2000compliant. At September 30, 1998, approximately 61% of Chase's SoftwareApplications had been remediated (from approximately 32% at June 30);approximately 85% of Chase's Facility Systems had been remediated (fromapproximately 80% at June 30, 1998) and approximately 53% of Chase's DesktopSystems (excluding non-critical data files) had been remediated (fromapproximately 37% at June 30).By December 31, 1998, Chase expects that substantially all of its SoftwareApplications will have been remediated, including Software Applications requiredto be remediated by third-party vendors. The majority of internal testing ofthese Software Applications systems will have been completed as well. Completionof these milestones by year-end exceeds the milestones established by Chase'sbanking regulators.In addition, Chase has set June 30, 1999 as its target date for completion ofall remediation and testing of all its TICs, Software Applications, FacilitySystems and Desktop Systems (including non-critical data files).As systems remediation and internal testing is completed, increased focus isbeing directed to external testing. During the third quarter of 1998, Chaseparticipated in tests with eight external agencies, including tests sponsored bythe Depository Trust Company, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the New YorkClearing House Association, the Hong Kong Clearing House and the SingaporeInterbank GIRO. Over a dozen additional external tests have been scheduled witha range of world-wide organizations, including among others, Cedel; Euroclear;and S.W.I.F.T. Chase expects to continue to participate in testing organized bymajor industry and governmental infrastructure organizations as they arescheduled during the remainder of 1998 and 1999. Testing with third parties iscritical, since a failure of a major external interface could have a materialadverse effect on the operations of Chase.In addition to its technology-related efforts, Chase has made significantprogress on its major customer and business-partner due diligence. By September30, 1998, Chase had completed the evaluation of its major credit customers,assessed their Year 2000 efforts and incorporated any Year 2000 customer risksinto its credit risk analysis processes. Chase is also in the process ofevaluating any potential Year 2000 impact upon its funding capability in orderto incorporate any such risks into its capital and liquidity planning, and iscompleting evaluation of its sub-custodian and international correspondentnetworks for Year 2000 readiness. Chase's outside service providers have beenidentified and prioritized, based upon how critical their function is to Chase,and contact has been made with critical third party service providers todetermine their Year 2000 readiness. The results of Chase's ongoing assessmentsand monitoring will be incorporated into its risk management processes over theremainder of 1998 and 1999. This planning includes determining the extent towhich any contingency plans will need to be executed.Costs: At December 31, 1997, Chase estimated the cost to remediate its Year 2000issues at approximately $300 million. This included costs incurred during 1997as well as costs expected to be incurred during 1998 and 1999. As a result ofseveral recent acquisitions, an anticipated need to increase the level oftesting in 1999 and strategic business decisions to accelerate systems upgrades,Chase is revising, as of September 30, 1998, its estimate of costs to remediateits Year 2000 issues for the 1997-1999 period to approximately $363 million. AtSeptember 30, 1998, Chase estimates that its full year 1998 Year 2000 costs willbe approximately $186 million. In addition, Chase currently estimates that fullyear 1999 Year 2000 costs will be approximately $127 million. These costsinclude the costs of remediation, testing, third party assessment, andcontingency planning, and will be expensed as incurred, but do not includeapproximately $33 million of capitalizable costs for Year 2000-compliantequipment that will be depreciated beyond December 31, 1999. -35-  36Risk Management and Contingency Planning: In its normal course of business,Chases manages many types of risk. Chase recognizes that the risks presented byYear 2000 are unique given the pervasive nature of the problem and the fact thatthere may be a higher likelihood that Year 2000 risk may present itself inmultiple, simultaneous impacts. Because of this, Chase has adjusted and willcontinue to adjust its risk management processes and contingency plans to takethe most probable anticipated Year 2000 effects into account. Although it is tooearly to predict accurately what "fails" may occur, Chase believes sufficientplanning, communication, coordination and testing will mitigate potentialmaterial disruption. In this regard, Chase has begun its "event planning" forthe Year 2000. In addition to the internal and external testing, and the credit,operational and liquidity assessments and planning discussed above, Chase's Year2000 "event planning" includes creation of command centers; establishment ofspecial rapid response technology teams; scheduling availability of keypersonnel; additional training, testing and simulation activities; andestablishment of rapid decision processes.Chase's expectations about completion of its Year 2000 remediation and testingefforts, the anticipated costs to complete the project and anticipated business,operational and financial risks to Chase are subject to a number ofuncertainties. Chase's estimates as to the cost to prepare for the Year 2000 arebased on numerous assumptions regarding future events including, among others,expectations regarding third party modification plans and the nature and amountof testing that may be required as well as continued availability of trainedpersonnel. For example, if Chase is affected by the inability of vendors,service providers, customers or securities exchanges to successfully implementtheir Year 2000 plans and continue operations, if Chase is unsuccessful inidentifying or fixing all Year 2000 problems in its critical operations, or ifChase is unable to retain the staff or third party consultants necessary toimplement its Year 2000 plans at currently projected costs and timetables,Chase's operations or financial results could be materially impacted. Thedisclosure contained in this 10-Q as well as the information previously filed byChase regarding its Year 2000 readiness during the period January 1, 1996 toOctober 19, 1998 are designated as Year 2000 readiness disclosure related to theYear 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.EMUAs a worldwide provider of foreign exchange, custody, cash management and fundstransfer services, and because Chase has an extensive international branch andsubsidiary network, Chase has also been actively preparing for the introductionof the "euro" on January 1, 1999. At that time, the exchange rates of thecurrencies of those countries participating in the European Economic andMonetary Union will be fixed; the euro will become a currency in its own right;and, although currencies of participating countries will continue to exist for athree year transition period, they will do so only as fixed denominations of theeuro. Chase anticipates rapid acceptance of the new currency, particularly bythe financial markets and large, wholesale customers. As a result, Chase intendsto conduct all risk management and internal accounting entirely in euros fromthe January 1, 1999 introduction date, while still retaining the flexibility toservice clients who continue to transact business in national currency units. Inaddition, Chase has established Chase Frankfurt as its electronic hub for alleuro payments in order to promote centralized payment flow and informationreporting. Chase believes this strategy offers the best means to manage thecomplexity of the conversion and mitigate associated operating risks.A dedicated EMU project team has been in place since November 1, 1996 to ensurethat necessary modifications to Chase's products, technology, businessoperations and customer service functions will be complete by January 1, 1999. Adetailed timeline was established and risk assessment reviews are made regularlyto track progress against the timeline. Remediation of all critical operatingsystems has been completed, and Chase has begun testing of impacted systemsworldwide. Two "dress rehearsals" have been completed and a third will becompleted during November 1998. As a result of these first two dress rehearsals,Chase believes that it will be able to pursue its businesses without materialinterruption or alteration after the implementation weekend on January 1, 1999.In addition, as part of its preparations, Chase has been working closely withits customers, counterparties, agent banks and regulatory agencies to mitigatethe payment and settlement risks resulting from the euro's introduction. Thisincludes the testing of interfaces with clients and establishing and testingelectronic links with national and pan-European clearing and payment systems.Chase has also been actively developing contingency plans to deal with anyliquidity issues that may result if changes in payment, clearing, or settlementprocedures result in an increase in misrouted funds. Chase estimates that thecosts to remediate its systems to prepare for the introduction of the euro willapproximate $60 million to $75 million in 1998. These costs will be expensed asthey are incurred.For a further discussion of Chase's management of its operating risk, see page41 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. -36-  37SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-5 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $2.7 billion atSeptember 30, 1998.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSDERIVATIVESIn June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, which establishes accounting andreporting standards for all derivative instruments, including certain derivativeinstruments embedded in other financial instruments (collectively referred to asderivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that an entitymeasure all derivatives at fair value and recognize those derivatives as eitherassets or liabilities in the balance sheet. The change in a derivative's fairvalue is generally recognized in current period earnings. However, if certainconditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of anexposure to changes in fair value, variability of cash flows, or certain foreigncurrency exposures. Based on the hedge designation, special hedge accountingrules allow the derivative's change in value to be recognized either in currentperiod earnings together with the offsetting change in value of the risk beinghedged, or, to the extent the hedge is effective, in comprehensive income andsubsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, withearly adoption permitted. Chase already recognizes the derivatives used in itstrading activities on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fairvalues of such derivatives included in earnings. This represents the substantialmajority of the derivatives utilized by Chase. With respect to those otherderivatives used as hedges of its assets, liabilities and commitments, Chase isassessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS 133 on its hedging activities andits effect on its financial condition and operating performance.MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIESIn October 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 134, which becomes effective for financialstatements beginning in the first quarter of 1999, with early adoptionencouraged. Chase is adopting SFAS 134 in the fourth quarter of 1998. SFAS 134further amends SFAS 65 to require that after the securitization of mortgageloans held for sale, an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities, such asChase, classify the resulting mortgage-backed securities, or other retainedinterests, based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments.Chase believes that the adoption of SFAS 134 will not have a material effect onits earnings, liquidity or capital resources.OTHER EVENTSOn May 7, 1998, Chase and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. ("Morgan Stanley")reached a definitive agreement under which Chase will acquire the global custodybusiness of Morgan Stanley, which has more than $400 billion of assets undercustody. The acquisition was completed in the 1998 fourth quarter. The clientsand staff joining Chase will be integrated into Chase Global Investor Services,which is part of Chase's Global Services business. -37-  38 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the three months ended September 30, 1998 and September 30, 1997, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.19% and 6.37%, respectively.(c) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes.(d) Includes $191 million pre-tax income for prior years' tax refunds.
