Table of ContentsThe table below presents information about delinquencies, net charge-offs (recoveries)&nbsp;andcomponents of reported and securitized financial assets at June&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006(see footnote (c)&nbsp;below).98 Table of ContentsNOTE 16 &#150; VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESRefer to Note 1 on page 94 and Note 15 on pages 118&#150;120 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Reportfor a further description of JPMorgan Chase's policies regarding consolidation of VIEs as well asthe utilization of VIEs by the Firm.Multi-seller conduitsThe following table summarizes the Firm's involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.The Firm views its credit exposure to multi-seller conduit transactions as limited. This isbecause, for the most part, the Firm is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if theassets in the VIE are in default. Additionally, the Firm's obligations under the letters of creditare secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the customer or other third parties &#150; forexample, by the overcollateralization of the VIE with the assets sold to it or notes subordinatedto the Firm's liquidity facilities.Client intermediationAssets held by credit-linked and municipal bond vehicles at June&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006,were as follows.The Firm may enter into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These transactionscan include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm'slength, and individual credit decisions are based upon the analysis of the specific VIE, takinginto consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where these activities do not causeJPMorgan Chase to absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIEs or to receive a majority ofthe residual returns of the VIE, JPMorgan Chase records and reports these positions similarly toany other third-party transaction. These transactions are not considered significant for disclosurepurposes.99 Table of ContentsConsolidated VIE assetsThe following table summarizes the Firm's total consolidated VIE assets, by classification, on theConsolidated balance sheets, as of June&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006.The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs areclassified in the line item titled, &#147;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interestentities&#148; on the Consolidated balance sheets. The holders of these beneficial interests do not haverecourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 19 on page 124 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006Annual Report for the maturity profile of FIN 46 long-term beneficial interests.NOTE 17 &#150; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS For a discussion of accounting policies related to Goodwill and Other intangible assets, see Note16 on pages 121&#150;123 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillThe $68&nbsp;million increase in Goodwill from year-end 2006 primarily resulted from certainacquisitions by Treasury & Securities Services (&#147;TSS&#148;) and tax-related purchase accountingadjustments associated with the Bank One merger, partially offset by a reduction from the adoptionof FIN 48. For a discussion of the impact from adopting FIN 48, see Note 20 on page 104.Goodwill was not impaired at June&nbsp;30, 2007, or December&nbsp;31, 2006, nor was any goodwill written offdue to impairment during either six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, or June&nbsp;30, 2006.Goodwill attributed to the business segments was as follows:100 Table of ContentsMortgage servicing rightsFor a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and valuationmethodology of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 121&#150;122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. For adiscussion of the valuation of MSRs, see Note 3 on page 76 of this Form 10-Q. The fair value ofMSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds.JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of derivatives and trading instruments to manage changes in thefair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes inthe fair value of the related risk management instruments. MSRs decrease in value when interestrates decline. Conversely, securities (such as mortgage&#150;backed securities), principal-onlycertificates and certain derivatives (when the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increasein value when interest rates decline.The following table summarizes MSR activity, for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and2006.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's MSRs at June&nbsp;30, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively; and it outlines the sensitivitiesof those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.CPR: Constant prepayment rateThe sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value basedupon a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.101 Table of ContentsPurchased credit card relationships and All other intangible assetsFor the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007, Purchased credit card relationships and All otherintangibles decreased by $612&nbsp;million primarily as a result of amortization expense.Except for $513&nbsp;million of indefinite-lived intangibles related to asset management advisorycontracts which are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, theremainder of the Firm's other acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization.The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were asfollows.Future amortization expenseThe following table presents estimated amortization expenses related to credit card relationships,core deposits and All other intangible assets at June&nbsp;30, 2007.102 Table of ContentsNOTE 18 &#150; EARNINGS PER SHAREFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) see Note 22on page 126 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The following table presents thecalculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006.NOTE 19 &#150; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;includes the after-tax change in unrealized gainsand losses on AFS securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact ofrelated derivatives), cash flow hedging activities and for 2007, the net actuarial loss andprior service cost related to the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.103 Table of ContentsNOTE 20 &#150; INCOME TAXESIn July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in incometaxes recognized under SFAS 109. FIN 48 addresses the recognition and measurement of tax positionstaken or expected to be taken, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The Firm adopted andapplied FIN 48 under the transition provisions to all of its income tax positions at the requiredeffective date of January&nbsp;1, 2007, resulting in a $436&nbsp;million cumulative effect increase toRetained earnings, a reduction in Goodwill of $113&nbsp;million and a $549&nbsp;million decrease in theliability for income taxes.At January&nbsp;1, 2007, JPMorgan Chase's liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding relatedinterest expense and penalties, was $4.7&nbsp;billion of which $1.0&nbsp;billion, if recognized, wouldreduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits couldchange significantly over the next twelve months. JPMorgan Chase does not expect that any suchchanges would have a material impact on its effective tax rate over the next twelve months.The Firm recognizes interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities in Income taxexpense. Included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities at January&nbsp;1, 2007,in addition to the Firm's liability for unrecognized tax benefits, was $1.3&nbsp;billion for incometax-related interest and penalties, of which the penalty component was not material.JPMorgan Chase is subject to ongoing tax examinations by the tax authorities of the variousjurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. TheFirm's consolidated federal income tax returns are presently under examination by the InternalRevenue Service (IRS)&nbsp;for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. In addition, the consolidated federalincome tax returns of heritage Bank One Corporation, which merged with and into JPMorgan Chase onJuly&nbsp;1, 2004, are under examination for the years 2000 through 2003, and for the period January&nbsp;1,2004, through July&nbsp;1, 2004. Both examinations are expected to conclude in 2008. Certainadministrative appeals are pending with the IRS relating to prior examination periods, forJPMorgan Chase for the years 2001 and 2002, and for Bank One and its predecessor entities forvarious periods from 1996 through 1999. For years prior to 2001, refund claims relating to incomeand credit adjustments, and to tax attribute carrybacks, for JPMorgan Chase and its predecessorentities, including Bank One, either have been or will be filed. Also, interest rate swapvaluations by a Bank One predecessor entity for the years 1990 through 1993 are, and have been,the subject of litigation in both the Tax Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals.104 Table of ContentsNOTE 21 &#150; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLitigation reserveThe Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. In accordancewith the provisions of SFAS 5, JPMorgan Chase accrues for a litigation-related liability when it isprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated. While the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in lightof all information known to it at June&nbsp;30, 2007, the Firm's litigation reserves were adequate atsuch date. Management reviews litigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increasedor decreased in the future to reflect further litigation developments. The Firm believes it hasmeritorious defenses to claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and,with respect to such litigation, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating orsettling cases according to management's judgment as to what is in the best interests ofstockholders.NOTE 22 &#150; ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESThe majority of JPMorgan Chase's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes. Derivativesare also utilized by the Firm as an end-user to hedge market exposures, to modify the interestrate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments or to meet longer-term investmentobjectives. Both trading and end-user derivatives are recorded in Trading assets and Tradingliabilities. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regardingderivative instruments, see Note 28 on pages 131-132 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. Thefollowing table presents derivative instrument hedging-related activities for the periodsindicated.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, it is expected that $151&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;at June&nbsp;30, 2007, will be recognized in earnings.The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and suchtransactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.NOTE 23 &#150; OFF&#150;BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEESFor a discussion of off&#150;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, and theFirm's related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 132&#150;134 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 AnnualReport. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, an allowance forcredit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on pages 93&#150;94 of this Form10-Q for a further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments.105 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts of off&#150;balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments and guarantees and the related allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments at June&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006.Off&#150;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guaranteesFor a discussion of the off&#150;balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers tobe guarantees under FIN 45, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 132&#150;134 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The amount of the liability related to FIN 45 guaranteesrecorded at June&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006, excluding commitments and derivative contractsdiscussed above, was $317&nbsp;million and $297&nbsp;million, respectively.In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which theFirm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. For a discussionof the derivatives the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, seeNote 29 on pages 132&#150;134 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The total notional value of thederivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $83&nbsp;billion and $72&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2007,and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was a derivative receivableof $226&nbsp;million and $230&nbsp;million, and a derivative payable of $1.3&nbsp;billion and $987&nbsp;million at June30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively.NOTE 24 &#150; DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On October&nbsp;1, 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of The Bank of New York's consumer,small-business and middle-market banking businesses in exchange for selected corporate trustbusinesses plus a cash payment of $150&nbsp;million. The Firm may also make a future payment to The Bankof New York of up to $50&nbsp;million depending on certain new account openings. During the quarter andsix months ended June&nbsp;30, 2006, Income from discontinued operations was $56&nbsp;million and $110million, respectively. There was no income from discontinued operations during the first six monthsof 2007.106 Table of ContentsJPMorgan Chase provides certain transitional services to The Bank of New York for a defined periodof time after the closing date. The Bank of New York compensates JPMorgan Chase for thesetransitional services.NOTE 25 &#150; BUSINESS SEGMENTSJPMorgan Chase is organized into six major reportable business segments: IB, RFS, CS, CommercialBanking (&#147;CB&#148;), TSS and Asset Management (&#147;AM&#148;), as well as a Corporate segment. The segments arebased upon the products and services provided or the type of customer served, and they reflect themanner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these linesof business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see the footnotesto the tables below. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase's business segments, seeBusiness segment results on page 16 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 34&#150;35 and Note 33 on pages 139&#150;141of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report.Business segment financial disclosuresOn January&nbsp;1, 2007, $19.4&nbsp;billion and $5.3&nbsp;billion held-for-investment residential mortgage loanswere transferred to the Corporate segment from RFS and AM, respectively. Although the loans,together with the responsibility for the investment management of the portfolio, were transferredto Treasury, the transfer has no impact on the financial results of RFS, AM or Corporate.SegmentresultsThe following tables provide a summary of the Firm's segment results for the three and six monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, on a managed basis. The impact of credit card securitizationadjustments have been included in Reconciling items so that the total Firm results are on areported basis. Finally, Total net revenue (Noninterest revenue and Net interest income) for eachof the segments is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exemptsecurities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the managed results on a basiscomparable to taxable securities and investments. This approach allows management to assess thecomparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The correspondingincome tax impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense (benefit).

Thesestatements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or currentfacts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;target,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148;&#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;goal,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; or other words of similar meaning. Forward-lookingstatements provide JPMorgan Chase's current expectations or forecasts of future events,circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase's disclosures in this report containforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnishedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). In addition, the Firm's senior management maymake forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media andothers.All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties. JPMorganChase's actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forward-lookingstatements. Factors that could cause this difference &#150; many of which are beyond the Firm's control&#150; include the following: local, regional and international business, political or economicconditions; changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws; technological changesinstituted by the Firm and by other entities which may affect the Firm's business; mergers andacquisitions, including the Firm's ability to integrate acquisitions; ability of the Firm todevelop new products and services; acceptance of new products and services and the ability of theFirm to increase market share; the ability of the Firm to control expenses; competitive pressures;changes in laws and regulatory requirements; changes in applicable accounting policies; costs,outcomes and effects of litigation and regulatory investigations; changes in the credit quality ofthe Firm's customers; and adequacy of the Firm's risk management framework.Additional factors that may cause future results to differ materially from forward-lookingstatements are discussed in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1A: Risk Factors in the Firm's 2006 Annual Report to whichreference is hereby made. There is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or riskfactors is complete.Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they aremade and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect theimpact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firmmay make in any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, or CurrentReports on Form 8-K.118 Table of ContentsItem&nbsp;3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the MarketRisk Management section of the management's discussion and analysis (&#147;MD&A&#148;) on pages 62&#150;65 of thisForm 10-Q.Item&nbsp;4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under thesupervision and with the participation of the Firm's management, including its Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based uponthat evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concludedthat these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for theCertification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief FinancialOfficer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting.Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting maynot prevent or detect misstatements.There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the second quarter of2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm'sinternal control over financial reporting.Part&nbsp;II Other InformationItem&nbsp;1 Legal proceedingsThe following information supplements and amends the disclosure set forth under Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3&#147;Legal proceedings&#148; in the Firm's 2006 Annual Report, and Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; inthe Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March&nbsp;31, 2007 (the&#147;Firm's SEC filings&#148;).Enron litigation. In the purported consolidated class action lawsuit by JPMorgan Chasestockholders, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in April&nbsp;2007 of the dismissal of their complaintto the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.A settlement has been reached in one of the bank lender cases, Bayerische Landesbank v. JPMorganChase Bank. This case, which named as defendants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and certain of theiraffiliates, was brought on behalf of six original lenders that participated in two revolving creditfacilities and a syndicated letter of credit facility that were provided to Enron and in connectionwith which JPMorgan Chase Bank and Citibank acted as agents. Defendants filed counterclaims againstthe plaintiff banks, including claims by JPMorgan Chase Bank for amounts owed by those banks underthe syndicated letter of credit facility. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the amounts ofthe payments to be made thereunder are confidential. As a result of the settlement, plaintiffs'claims and defendants' counterclaims will be dismissed.In the action pending in New York Supreme Court, New York County, alleging claims relating to theFirm's role as Indenture Trustee, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on May24, 2007.IPO allocation litigation. With respect to the IPO securities cases, on May&nbsp;18, 2007, the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered an order reaffirming its April&nbsp;6, 2007,denial of plaintiffs' petition for panel rehearing of the Court's December&nbsp;5, 2006, decision onclass certification. The May&nbsp;18 Order further noted that plaintiffs' petition for rehearing en banchad been transmitted to all eligible judges and that no such judge requested that a vote be takenthereon. On May&nbsp;30, 2007, the Second Circuit issued its Mandate, whereby the Court ordered that thejudgment of the District Court be vacated and remanded for further proceedings in accordance withthe Court's December&nbsp;5, 2006 opinion, and Plaintiffs are scheduled to file amended complaints andmotions for class certification in the District Court.By stipulation dated June&nbsp;22 and so ordered on June&nbsp;25, 2007, the proposed settlement ofplaintiffs' claims against 298 of the issuer defendants in these cases was terminated. JPMorganChase had previously notified plaintiffs on December&nbsp;13, 2006, that the preliminary &#147;memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU)&#148; outlining terms of a &#147;proposed settlement&#148; as between plaintiffs and JPMorganChase is unenforceable.Plaintiffs' appeal to the Second Circuit from the District Court's February&nbsp;28, 2006, finaljudgment dismissing the LaSala Actions was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on June&nbsp;11, 2007.On June&nbsp;22, 2007, the Second Circuit issued its Mandate withdrawing the appeal. UnderwriterDefendants have requested that the District Court enter judgment in the remainder of the LaSalaActions in which judgment had been withheld pending appellate proceedings.119 Table of ContentsWith respect to the IPO antitrust cases, on June&nbsp;18, 2007, the United States Supreme Court reversedthe Second Circuit's reversal of the District Court's November&nbsp;3, 2003 dismissal decision, therebyholding that the cases must be dismissed.National Century Financial Enterprise litigation. On June&nbsp;14, 2007, the Court lifted most of theremaining stay on discovery. The parties are exchanging documents and preparing for depositiondiscovery.In re JPMorgan Chase Cash Balance Litigation. On May&nbsp;30, 2007, the United States District Court forthe Southern District of New York certified a class in this action. The class includes currentparticipants in the JPMorgan Chase Retirement Plan with claims relating to inadequate notice ofplan changes stemming from January&nbsp;1, 2002, forward and age discrimination claims going back as faras January&nbsp;1, 1989. The class excludes former participants who have elected to receive a lump sumcash payment of their retirement benefits. The Court reserved the right to revisit its classcertification decision pending resolution of a similar case that is now before the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Fact discovery concerning both the notice and agediscrimination claims is ongoing, but is limited to the period January&nbsp;1, 2002, and thereafter.In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations discussed above, JPMorgan Chaseand its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a number of other legalactions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses. Additionalactions, investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. In view ofthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where theclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legaltheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannotstate with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timingof the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties orimpact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its currentknowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigationreserves, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pendingagainst it should not have a material, adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition ofthe Firm. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions andinvestigations, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will notsignificantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of aparticular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period,depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level ofJPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm, see Part&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;1A, Risk Factors, on pages4&#150;6 and Forward-Looking Statements on page 147 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report.Item&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the second quarter of 2007, there were no shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase &Co. issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuantto Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof.On April&nbsp;17, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0&nbsp;billion of theFirm's common shares.
