B25  37MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCOMPARISON BETWEEN 1993 AND 1992OVERVIEWChemical Banking Corporation (the "Corporation") earned record net income of$1,604 million for 1993, an increase of 48% from $1,086 million reported for1992. Net income per common share for 1993 was $5.77, compared with $3.90 in1992. The higher net income in 1993 reflected strong revenue growth in theCorporation's core businesses. Total noninterest revenue in 1993 increased 33%from 1992 reflecting strong performances from capital markets, corporatefinance, personal trust and national consumer activities, as well as higherprofits from venture capital activities. Also contributing to the strongearnings was a lower provision for losses reflecting improvement in theCorporation's credit quality. The Corporation's 1993 results included the impact of two significantaccounting changes. On January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted FinancialAccounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting forPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), which resulted in acharge of $415 million and Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"), which resulted in an incometax benefit of $450 million. The net favorable impact of the adoption of thesetwo new accounting standards was $35 million. Income before the effect of theseaccounting changes was $1,569 million ($5.63 per common share), an increase of44% from 1992. Due to the strength of its earnings, the Corporation recognized in1993 its remaining available Federal tax benefits. Tax benefits in 1993amounted to $331 million (excluding the aforementioned adoption of SFAS 109),compared with $278 million in 1992. The Corporation's earnings, beginning withthe fourth quarter of 1993, were reported on a fully-taxed basis. For all of 1993, the Corporation realized merger-related expensesavings of $525 million related to the December 31, 1991 merger of theCorporation and MHC, compared with $280 million in 1992. The Corporation's nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993 were $3.53billion, down 42% from $6.09 billion at the 1992 year-end. Nonperforming assetswere 2.4% of total assets at the end of 1993, compared with 4.4% at December31, 1992. At December 31, 1993, the non-LDC allowance for losses was 123% ofnon-LDC nonperforming loans, compared with 64% at the same date a year ago. In 1993, the Corporation increased the quarterly cash dividend on itsoutstanding common stock to $0.38 per share, a 27% increase from the quarterlydividend of $0.30 per share paid in 1992. This overall increase was achievedthrough an increase in March 1993 to $0.33 per share and in December 1993 to$0.38 per share. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation's ratios of Tier 1 Capital torisk-weighted assets and Total Capital to risk-weighted assets were 8.12% and12.22%, respectively, well in excess of the minimum ratios specified by theBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board"),compared with 7.33% and 11.55%, respectively, at December 31, 1992.[NET INCOME BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX][RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX]B26  38RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNET INTEREST INCOME(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount includedin the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt andtaxable assets. The Corporation's net interest income was $4,636 million in 1993, upfrom $4,598 million in 1992. The improvement in net interest income for 1993was due to the favorable impact from the reduction in nonperforming loans,higher average interest earning assets and lower funding costs (primarily as aresult of the upgrades to the Corporation's credit ratings). These improvementswere partially offset by a decrease in the Corporation's loan portfolio as aresult of continued sluggish loan demand, loan paydowns from businessesrefinancing their borrowings in the debt and equity markets, as well asmanagement's strategic decision to reduce the credit risk profile of theCorporation. As a consequence, there was a remixing of the composition of theCorporation's average interest-earning assets to liquid assets, which supportthe Corporation's trading businesses. Also contributing to the reduction in netinterest income was the expiration of positions taken prior to and in the earlypart of 1992 to take advantage of declining U.S. interest rates. The negative impact on net interest income from nonperforming loans in1993 was $111 million, down from $293 million in 1992. The improvement isprincipally due to the significant reduction in the level of the Corporation'snonperforming loans as well as the lower interest rate environment in 1993. Average interest-earning assets rose 3.0% in 1993 to $124.9 billion,compared with $121.2 billion in 1992. The growth occurred in Federal funds andresale agreements, trading account assets, consumer loans and securities,partially offset by a decline in commercial lending. Although the asset remixresulted in a lower contribution to net interest income, the increase in liquidtrading account assets resulting from the remix contributed to the significantincrease in trading revenue, which is recorded in noninterest revenue. The Corporation's average total loans in 1993 were $78.7 billion, adecrease of $3.5 billion from a year ago. As a percentage of totalinterest-earning assets, the loan portfolio decreased to 63.0% in 1993 from67.8% a year ago. The decline was due to the aforementioned reduction incommercial lending, partially offset by the continued growth in consumer loans,principally credit card and installment loans.[NET INTEREST INCOME BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX] The securities portfolio averaged $23.7 billion in 1993, compared with$21.7 billion in 1992. The Corporation's liquid interest-earning assetsaveraged $22.5 billion in 1993, an increase of $5.1 billion from a year ago. Asa result of the aforementioned remix of interest-earning assets, the percentageof the combined portfolio of securities and liquid assets to totalinterest-earning assets increased to 37.0% in 1993 from 32.2% in 1992. The $3.7 billion growth in interest-earning assets was funded by a$2.3 billion increase in interest-bearing liabilities and a $1.4 billionincrease in interest-free funds. For 1993, average interest-bearing liabilitieswere $106.5 billion, compared with $104.2 billion for the same period in 1992.The Corporation's average core deposit base increased 7% in 1993 to $60.8billion and funded 48.7% of average interest-earning assets, compared with47.1% during 1992. As a result of this increase in core deposits, coupled withthe issuance of long-term debt and internally generated capital during 1993,the Corporation was able to utilize lower-cost funds to supportinterest-earning assets in 1993. The interest rate spread, which is the difference between the averagerate on interest-earning assets and the average rate on interest-bearingliabilities, was 3.20% for both 1993 and 1992. During 1993, the spread wasfavorably affected by the smaller negative impact from nonperforming loans andlower funding costs, offset by the aforementioned shift in the Corporation'sbalance sheet asset mix. The net yield on interest-earning assets, which is the average ratefor interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources offunds, including the impact of interest-free funds, was 3.73% in 1993, comparedwith 3.82% in 1992. The decline in the net yield was impacted by the samefactors that affected the interest rate spread, as well as by a lowercontribution from interest-free sources of funds. The contribution frominterest-free funds to the net yield in 1993 was 53 basis B27  39points, compared with 62 basis points in 1992. The decline resulted from thelower interest rate environment in 1993, despite an increase of $1.4 billion ininterest-free funds that financed interest-earning assets. Management anticipates that the net yield on interest-earning assetswill be slightly lower in 1994 than 1993. Net interest income in 1994 isexpected to approximate the 1993 level as an anticipated higher level ofinterest-earning assets is expected to offset the anticipated decline in netyield.(a) Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances.DOMESTIC NET INTEREST INCOMEDomestic net interest income was $3,697 million in 1993, an increase of $53million from the prior year. The increase in 1993 was attributable to a higherlevel of interest-earning assets and the significant reduction in nonperformingloans, partially offset by the aforementioned remixing of the Corporation'sinterest-earning assets.FOREIGN NET INTEREST INCOMENet interest income from foreign operations was $939 million for 1993, comparedwith $954 million in 1992. In 1993, the Corporation recorded interestcollections on Argentine loans of $48 million (including a one-time cashpayment of $29 million related to interest arrearages), compared with $19million in 1992. Interest income on Brazilian loans was $75 million in 1993,relatively unchanged from $76 million in 1992.[COMPOSITION OF INTEREST - EARNING ASSETS PIE CHART -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX]PROVISION FOR LOSSESThe provision for losses in 1993 was $1,259 million, a decrease of 8% from$1,365 million in 1992. In both years, the provision equaled the amount of therespective year's non-LDC net charge-offs (which was lower in 1993 than in1992, despite a $55 million provision related to the decision to accelerate thedisposition of certain nonperforming residential mortgage loans). As a result of the significant improvement in the Corporation'snonperforming assets during 1993 and the favorable credit environmentanticipated for 1994, the Corporation expects a significant reduction in theprovision for losses in 1994. Noninterest revenue totaled $4,024 million in 1993, an increase of 33%from last year. The growth in noninterest revenue was primarily the result ofrecord combined trading revenue, increases in various fee-based revenue, higherventure capital gains and other revenue, principally gains from the sale ofrefinancing country securities.B28  40 Trust and investment management fees are primarily derived fromcorporate and personal trust activities. Services provided include custody,securities processing, and private banking to customers on a global basis. Theincrease of $45 million for 1993 was principally due to growth in theCorporation's personal trust and asset management businesses. Personal trustfees increased $31 million in 1993 to $196 million, principally due to a risein the market value of investments under management and to new customerrelationships developed as a result of two acquisitions by Texas CommerceBancshares Inc. ("Texas Commerce") in 1993: the acquisition of certain assetsof the former First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc. ("First City Banks") inFebruary 1993 and the acquisition of Ameritrust Texas Corporation("Ameritrust") in September 1993. Corporate finance and syndication fees include revenue from managingand syndicating loan arrangements; providing financial advisory services inconnection with leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations and mergers andacquisitions; and arranging private placements. Corporate finance andsyndication fees in 1993 reached $338 million, a 28% increase from the prioryear, principally resulting from the continued strong growth in global loanoriginations and distribution activities. During 1993, the Corporation acted asagent or co-agent for approximately $185 billion of syndicated creditfacilities, a reflection of the Corporation's large client base and strongemphasis on distribution. During 1993, the Federal Reserve Board approved theCorporation's applications to underwrite and deal in all debt and equitysecurities. Fees from underwriting debt offerings also contributed to theincrease. Service charges on deposit accounts totaled $288 million in 1993, anincrease of 9% over last year. The increase from 1992 was primarily due to thehigher level of fees related to retail accounts as well as a larger depositbase (principally resulting from the acquisition of the First City Banks).[NONINTEREST REVENUE BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX] Fees for other banking services for 1993 were $1,067 million, anincrease of $27 million from a year ago, which is indicative of the continuedgrowth in the Corporation's core revenue businesses. The fee level for 1993 wasprimarily affected by changes in the following areas:* Retail credit card fees increased $28 million from last year due to increased transaction volume, reflecting a growing consumer cardholder base and the return to the balance sheet of previously securitized loans. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Corporation initiated a program for a co-branded MasterCard with Shell Oil Company. Revenue from the Shell program was insignificant in 1993; however, it is expected to contribute to growth in retail card fees for 1994.* Mortgage servicing fees increased $6 million in 1993, reflecting the purchase of mortgage servicing rights as well as a higher level of mortgage originations resulting from the low interest-rate environment in 1993. The Corporation originated $14.7 billion of mortgage loans in 1993 versus $12.5 billion in 1992.* Loan commitment fees were $90 million in 1993, an increase of $9 million from 1992.* Loan servicing fees were $23 million in 1993, a decrease of $20 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting the reduction in the level of securitized credit card loans serviced in 1993 versus 1992. Combined revenues from trading account and foreign exchange activitiesin 1993 were $1,073 million, an increase of 26% from $853 million a year ago.The increase was in part due to continued efforts by the Corporation todiversify and expand its trading activities through an emphasis onmarket-making and sales businesses. The Corporation's sources of tradingrevenue are through sales, arbitrage, market-making and positioning. In 1993,the Corporation, taking advantage of its higher credit ratings and itsincreasing global presence, broadened its global trading activities andincreased the range of products it offers and the currency markets in which itoperates. The resulting growth in transaction volume, coupled with a broaderrange of instruments, market volatility and wider spreads (especially in theEuropean markets) contributed to the increased revenues. The following table sets forth the components of trading account andforeign exchange revenues for 1993 and 1992.(a) Includes interest rate swaps, currency swaps, foreign exchange forwardcontracts, interest rate futures, and forward rate agreements.(b) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.(c) Includes U.S. and foreign government agency and corporate debt securities;emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives, equity securities,equity derivatives, and commodity derivatives. B29  41 Trading revenues are affected by many factors including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by theCorporation's customers, its success in proprietary positioning, its creditstandings and steps taken by central banks and governments to affect financialmarkets. Although the Corporation believes that its improved credit standinghas recently been contributing to the improvement in its trading revenue, otherfactors, such as market volatility, governmental actions, or success inproprietary positioning, might not be as favorable in future periods as theywere in 1993. For a further discussion of the Corporation's risk-managementproducts and related revenues, see the Off-Balance Sheet section of theManagement's Discussion and Analysis and Note Eighteen of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements. Securities gains were $142 million in 1993, compared with $53 millionin 1992. For further discussion of the Corporation's securities, see theSecurities section. The Corporation's other noninterest revenue is primarily comprised ofincome from venture capital activities, equity income from affiliates(including the Corporation's 40% interest in The CIT Group Holdings, Inc.("CIT")), and gains on the sale of corporate assets. The most significant itemswithin other revenue for 1993 and 1992 are listed in the following table.(a) Principally reflects a $179 million gain from the sale of Argentinefloating rate bonds and $152 million gain from the sale of interest due andunpaid bonds received from Brazil.(b) The Corporation's 40% net investment in CIT at December 31, 1993 and 1992,totaled $849 million and $816 million, respectively. Income from venture capital activities, net of valuation losses, was$301 million in 1993, an increase of $201 million from 1992. At December 31,1993, the Corporation had equity and equity-related investments with a carryingvalue of $1.3 billion. On average, these investments are held for four to sevenyears. Income is recognized when an investment is sold or the investment ismarked to market at a discount to the public value upon completion of aninitial public offering. The Corporation believes that venture capital willcontinue to make substantial contributions to the Corporation's earnings,although the timing of the recognition of gains from such activities isunpredictable and it is expected that revenues from such activities will varysignificantly from period to period.NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense in 1993 was $5,293 million, compared with $4,930million in 1992. Included in noninterest expense were expenses related to twoacquisitions by Texas Commerce during 1993 and higher expenses associated withinvestments in certain key businesses, such as expansion of the Corporation'ssecurities business and the introduction of the co-branded MasterCard programwith Shell Oil Company. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Corporation incurred$53 million in operating expenses in connection with its introduction of theShell MasterCard from Chemical Bank. Noninterest expense for 1993 reflected $525 million in expense savingsrelated to the December 31, 1991 merger of the Corporation and MHC, up from$280 million of expense savings for 1992. The Corporation expects to continueto realize expense savings (estimated at approximately $710 million in 1994 andapproximately $750 million in 1995 and each year thereafter) and one-timemerger related benefits in connection with its implementation of the merger.During 1993, the Corporation incurred a charge of $115 million, principallyrelated to changes since the date of the merger in the Corporation's facilitiesplans and revised estimates of occupancy-related costs associated withheadquarters and branch consolidations. The Corporation does not anticipate anyfurther merger-related restructuring charges. During 1993, the ratio of noninterest operating expense (excludingone-time charges) to total operating revenue improved to 59.1% from 63.7% in1992. Salaries and employee benefits expenses in 1993 were $2,466 million,compared with $2,349 million recorded in 1992. The increase from last year wasprimarily the result of significantly higher incentive compensation costs dueto increased revenues (primarily from the Corporation's capital markets andcorporate finance activities), higher expenses related to services provided bytemporary employment agencies to assist with merger integration efforts, andthe additional staff costs from the 1993 acquisitions by Texas Commerce.Additionally, as a result of the adoption of SFAS 106, expenses for 1993related to other postretirement benefits ("OPEB") were approximately $20million higher than in 1992.B30  42 Total staff at December 31, 1993 amounted to 41,567 compared with39,687 at December 31, 1992. The increase in staff count from December 31, 1992is attributable to the acquisition of the First City Banks and Ameritrust. AtDecember 31, 1993, merger-related staff reductions totaled 6,221 from July 15,1991 (the date the merger with MHC was first announced) exceeding the goal of6,200 established at that time. In 1994, the Corporation expects pension andOPEB expense to be approximately $30 million higher than the 1993 levelprimarily due to a decrease in the discount rate utilized in determining thebenefit obligation to 7.5%. For a further discussion, see Note Thirteen of theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Occupancy expense in 1993 was $587 million, an increase of $21 millionfrom 1992. The increase in 1993 principally resulted from $13 million inoccupancy-related expenses associated with the facilities acquired inconnection with the First City Banks and Ameritrust transactions. The remainingincrease in occupancy expense largely reflected the consolidation andrelocation of certain facilities in London. Equipment expense in 1993 was $337 million compared with $316 millionin 1992. The increase in 1993 was primarily the result of technologyenhancements to support the Corporation's investment in certain businesses,such as Geoserve, retail banking and capital markets. Foreclosed property expense was $287 million in 1993, compared with$283 million in 1992. Included in the 1993 results was $20 million related tothe accelerated disposition of nonperforming assets originally extended severalyears ago under a reduced-documentation residential mortgage program that wasdiscontinued in 1990. Management expects that foreclosed property expense in1994 will be significantly lower than the 1993 level. In 1993, the Corporation incurred the aforementioned $115 millioncharge related to the final assessment of costs associated with the merger withMHC and $43 million in connection with the acquisition of assets and assumptionof liabilities of the First City Banks from the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (the "FDIC"). For a further discussion, see Note Two of the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense comprises items such as professional services,insurance, marketing, communications expense and FDIC assessments. Otherexpense in 1993 was $1,458 million compared with $1,416 million in 1992. The1992 amount included a $41 million charge incurred in combining theCorporation's employee benefit plans and a $30 million charge for theCorporation's Canary Wharf lease arrangement. The increase in other expensefrom last year principally reflected higher marketing costs, operating expensesassociated with the First City Banks and Ameritrust acquisitions, and higherFDIC costs due to a higher deposit base as a result of such acquisitions. Marketing expense for 1993 was $187 million, an increase of $76million from 1992. The higher level of marketing expense reflected theCorporation's marketing program for the co-branded MasterCard with Shell OilCompany, an increase in credit card solicitation costs (exclusive of Shell),and increased promotional advertising related to the Corporation's retailbanking business. Included in other expense for 1993 was approximately $76 millionrelated to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and otherongoing expenses associated with the First City Banks and Ameritrustacquisitions. As a result of these acquisitions, total amortization of goodwilland intangibles increased to $106 million in 1993 from $80 million in 1992. The Corporation expects that noninterest operating expense in 1994will be somewhat higher than that in 1993 (after taking into consideration theeffects of merger-related cost savings anticipated to be realized during theyear), reflecting costs associated with the continued investment by theCorporation to grow key business activities. Nevertheless, one of management'sobjectives for 1994 and thereafter will be to continue to improve the ratio ofnoninterest operating expenses to total operating revenue.[OVERHEAD RATIO BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX]INCOME TAXESThe Corporation recorded income tax expense of $539 million in 1993, comparedwith $243 million in 1992. Included in the 1993 and 1992 income tax expensewere approximately $331 million and $278 million, respectively, of Federalincome tax benefits. The Corporation adopted SFAS 109 as of January 1, 1993, and, aftertaking into account the additional tax benefits associated with the adoption ofSFAS 106, the Corporation recognized a favorable cumulative effect on incometax expense of $450 million (or $1.81 per common share). This favorable impactwas recorded within the caption "Net Effect of Changes in Account- B31  43ing Principles" on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Prior years' financialstatements have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS 109. Due to the strength of its earnings, the Corporation recognized in thethird quarter of 1993 its remaining available Federal income tax benefits inaccordance with SFAS 109. As a result, the Corporation's earnings beginning inthe fourth quarter of 1993 were reported on a fully-taxed basis. On August 10, 1993, President Clinton signed the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act ("OBRA") of 1993, which increased the corporate Federal taxrate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993. The impact of the higherFederal tax rate increased the Corporation's tax provision; however, this wasmore than offset by an increase in the value of the Corporation's deferred taxassets. As a result, the Corporation's tax expense in 1993 decreased byapproximately $8 million due to the enactment of OBRA. The Corporation's effective tax rate was 25.6% in 1993, compared with18.3% in 1992. Excluding the $331 million of benefits recognized under SFAS 109for 1993, the Corporation's effective tax rate for 1993 would have been 41.3%.Excluding the $278 million of benefits recognized in 1992, the Corporation'seffective tax rate for 1992 would have been 39.2%.LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSProfitability of the Corporation is tracked with an internal information systemthat produces line-of-business performance within the Global Bank, RegionalBank, Real Estate and Corporate sectors. A set of management accountingpolicies has been developed and implemented to ensure that the reported resultsof the groups reflect the economics of their businesses. Line-of-businessresults are subject to restatement as appropriate whenever there arerefinements in management reporting policies or changes to the managementorganization. Thus, certain amounts reported in 1992 have been restated toconform with the presentation of the current-year's results. Line-of-businessresults are subject to further restatements as may be necessary to reflectfuture changes in internal management reporting. Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurredby businesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocatingstockholders' equity and the provision for losses, utilizing a risk-basedmethodology. Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to thebusiness units except for special corporate one-time charges. Management hasdeveloped a risk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different typesof risk -- credit, operating and market -- within various businesses andassigns capital accordingly. Credit risk is computed using a risk-gradingsystem that is consistently applied throughout the Corporation. TheCorporation's businesses are evaluated on a fully-taxed basis. The tax benefitscurrently reflected in the Corporation's income tax expense (which results in alower effective tax rate) are generally included in the Corporate sector. Texas Commerce's results are tracked and reported on a legal entitybasis, including the return-on-common equity calculation.GLOBAL BANKThe Global Bank is organized into three principal management entities: Banking& Corporate Finance (domestic wholesale banking, corporate finance and venturecapital activities); Asia, Europe & Capital Markets (international wholesalebanking and corporate finance, and the Corporation's trading and treasuryfunctions); and Developing Markets (businesses include cross-border investmentbanking, local merchant banking and trade finance). The Global Bank seeks tooptimize its risk profile by emphasizing underwriting, distribution, andrisk-management skills. The Global Bank produced excellent results in 1993, as evidenced bynet income of $1.181 billion and a 31.9% return on equity, a substantialincrease from the 1992 results of $806 million and 20.2%, respectively. The1993 performance was characterized by strong noninterest revenue growth.Overall trading revenues exceeded $1.050 billion in 1993, up approximately 26%from $834 million in 1992. Earnings from derivatives, foreign exchange andsecurities trading were particularly strong throughout the entire globalnetwork. Trading results in the emerging markets area were almost double theamounts recorded in 1992. Corporate finance and syndication fees were also strong in 1993, areflection of the Corporation's leadership position in global loan originationand distribution, as the Global Bank continued to be the industry leader inloan syndications during 1993. In 1993, revenues from venture capitalactivities were $301 million, a substantial increase from $100 million in 1992.The Developing Markets Group also benefited from $301 million of noninterestrevenue related to restructured country debt, principally the sale of Argentineand Brazilian debt securities.B32  44REGIONAL BANKThe Regional Bank includes Retail Banking (comprised of New York Markets,Retail Card Services and National Consumer Business), Regional RelationshipBanking (comprised of Middle Market, Private Banking and Chemical Bank NewJersey, N.A.) and Geoserve. The Corporation's Technology and Operations groupis also managed within this organizational structure. The Retail Bank providesa broad array of products and services including consumer lending, residentialfinancing, deposit services and credit card financing. The Corporationmaintains a leading market share position in serving the financial needs ofMiddle Market commercial enterprises in the New York metropolitan area. PrivateBanking serves its high-net worth clientele with banking and investmentservices. The Geoserve unit offers cash management, funds transfer, trade,corporate trust and securities processing to the global market and is a marketleader in many of its businesses. The Regional Bank's net income of $504 million and return on equity of23.9% in 1993 improved significantly from the 1992 results of $351 million and15.2%, respectively. In 1993, New York Markets' net income increased modestlyfrom 1992, reflecting a higher level of fees and wider deposit spreads. TheNational Consumer Business results reflected strong net interest income growthin 1993 as loan volume substantially increased. Mortgage servicing volumeexceeded $36.4 billion, an increase of $6.0 billion over the prior year, andcontributed to higher servicing fee revenues. Retail Card Services alsobenefited from higher net interest income due to increased volume. Thisperformance was accompanied by an improvement in overall credit quality, ascharge-offs in the Retail Card portfolio in 1993 declined from 1992 levels.During the fourth quarter of 1993, a program for a co-branded MasterCard withShell Oil Company was announced. The new Shell MasterCard offers cardholdersrebates towards the purchase of Shell gasoline. The start-up costs associatedwith this program accounted for over two-thirds of the overall increase innoninterest expense for the Regional Bank compared with 1992. RegionalRelationship Banking had a significant increase in earnings, primarily due toreduced credit costs in Middle Market and Chemical Bank New Jersey, N.A.Private Banking produced higher earnings as a result of increased net interestincome (represented by solid loan growth) and fees. Geoserve also reported anincrease in its earnings in 1993 over the prior year, primarily due tosignificant growth in revenue from several new business initiatives.TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARESTexas Commerce is a premier corporate banking institution in the State of Texasand a leader in providing financial products and services to individualsthroughout Texas. The 1993 results included the acquisitions of the First CityBanks and Ameritrust. As a result of these acquisitions, Texas Commerce had thelargest trust operations in the southwest United States. As of December 31,1993, Texas Commerce had $22 billion in total assets. Texas Commerce's net income of $190 million in 1993 improved from lastyear's results of $180 million. The improved 1993 results also included $79million of income tax expense compared with only $4 million for last year dueto the use of net operating loss carryforwards in 1992. On a pre-tax basis, the$269 million of operating earnings posted by Texas Commerce was up 46% overlast year and represented the most profitable year in its history. Althoughcommercial loan demand remained weak, Texas Commerce benefited from its strongcustomer base to post substantial increases in revenue from fee-based servicesand growth in deposit volumes. Solid expense management also contributed to thestrong earnings. The aforementioned results for the year ended December 31, 1993exclude the restructuring charge ($43 million pre-tax; $30 million after-tax)related to the acquisition of the First City Banks and a positive $9 millionafter-tax net effect from the implementation of SFAS 106 and SFAS 109. Nonperforming assets declined to $219 million at December 31, 1993,down 49% from the end of 1992 and 84% below the peak of $1,303 million inmid-1988. Based on the continuing improvements in asset quality and TexasCommerce's already adequate allowance for losses, no overall credit provisionwas recorded in 1993. B33  45REAL ESTATEReal Estate includes the management of the Corporation's commercial real estateportfolio, exclusive of those in Texas Commerce and Chemical Bank New Jersey,N.A. The net loss of $222 million in 1993 resulted from credit costs remainingat high levels, although credit quality continued to improve. Totalnonperforming assets at December 31, 1993 were $1,304 million, down 33% from$1,944 million at December 31, 1992. Noninterest expense of $213 million for1993 included $119 million of foreclosed property expense.n/m--Not meaningful due to net loss.CORPORATECorporate had a net loss of $49 million in 1993, compared with a net loss of $6million in 1992. Included in the $49 million loss were the following one-timeitems: a noninterest expense charge of $67 million ($115 million pre-tax) as aresult of a reassessment of costs associated with the merger with MHC; anafter-tax loss of $53 million ($75 million pre-tax) due to the writedownassociated with the accelerated disposition of nonperforming residentialmortgages; and a $30 million after-tax restructuring charge ($43 millionpre-tax) related to the acquisition of the First City Banks. In addition,Corporate included the recognition of any Federal tax benefits and a net $35million gain from the adoption of SFAS 106 and SFAS 109. Included in the $6million net loss in 1992 were one-time charges of $41 million for costsincurred to combine the Corporation's employee benefit plans, and $30 millionfor London occupancy-related expenses in connection with the Corporation'sCanary Wharf lease arrangements. Corporate also includes the management results attributed to theparent company, the Corporation's investment in CIT, and some effects remainingat the corporate level after the implementation of management accountingpolicies. The following examples represent management accounting policies whichhad a corporate impact: the performance of individual businesses are evaluatedon a fully-taxed basis, whereas the Corporation's overall tax rate in 1993 waslower due to the utilization of Federal tax benefits; the difference betweenrisk-adjusted credit loss provisions in the business units and the overallfinancial provision for losses taken by the Corporation; and the differencebetween risk-adjusted capital in the groups and the Corporation's financialcapital.BALANCE SHEET ANALYSISSECURITIESAs of December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt andEquity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). As a result of the adoption of SFAS 115, debtand equity securities that were previously measured at amortized cost or at thelower of aggregate amortized cost or market are measured at fair value. SeeNote Four of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for furtherdiscussion of SFAS 115. The prepayment of mortgage-backed securities and collateralizedmortgage obligations ("CMO") is actively monitored through the Corporation'sportfolio management function. The Corporation typically invests in CMO's withstable cash flows and relatively short duration, thereby limiting the impact ofinterest rate fluctuations on the portfolio. Management regularly doessimulation testing regarding the impact that interest and market rate changeswould have on its CMO portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities and CMO's whichmanagement believes have high prepayment risk are included in theavailable-for-sale portfolio.CREDIT PORTFOLIOLoans outstanding, the most significant component of earning assets, totaled$75.4 billion at December 31, 1993, compared with $82.0 billion at December 31,1992. The decline of $6.6 billion primarily reflected weak loan demand (exceptlarge syndicated loans discussed below), loan paydowns from businesses that arerefinancing their borrowings in the debt and equity markets, as well asmanagement's strategic decision to reduce the credit risk profile of theCorporation. Partially offsetting these declines was growth in credit cardreceivables and installment loans. The Corporation is a leading participant in loan originations andsales. This activity is comprised of the sale of loans and lending commitmentsto investors, generally without recourse. These sales include syndication,assignment and participation, and include both short- and medium-termtransactions. This loan distribution capability allows the Corporation tocompete aggressively and profitably in wholesale lending markets by enabling itto reduce larger individual credit exposures and thereby to price more flexiblythan if all loans were held as permanent investments. The Corporation alsobenefits from increased liquidity.B34  46 The Corporation's loan balances at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were asfollows:(a) Represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loanssecured by mortgages on 1-4 family residential properties.(b) Consists of 1-4 family residential mortgages, credit cards, installmentloans (direct and indirect types of consumer finance) and student loans.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTA significant aspect of banking is understanding, measuring and managing creditrisk. Credit risk represents the possibility that a loss may occur if aborrower or counterparty fails to honor fully the terms of a contract. Underthe direction of the Chief Credit Officer, risk policies are formulated,approved and communicated throughout the Corporation. The Credit RiskManagement Committee, chaired by the Chief Credit Officer, is responsible formaintaining a sound credit process, addressing risk issues and reviewing theportfolio. The Corporation's credit risk management is an integrated processoperating concurrently at the transaction and portfolio levels. For creditorigination, business units formulate strategies, target markets and determineacceptable levels of risk. Credit officers work with client managers, portfoliomanagement and, when appropriate, the syndications group during theunderwriting process. The consumer and commercial segments of the portfolio have differentrisk characteristics and different techniques are utilized to measure andmanage their credit risks. The consumer portfolio is evaluated on a product aswell as geographic basis. Within the commercial segment, each credit facilityis risk graded. Facilities are subject to hold targets based on risk, and areoften syndicated in order to lower potential concentration risks. Credits notsyndicated remain on the balance sheet and are carefully monitored andanalyzed. The loan review process includes industry specialists and countryrisk managers who provide independent expert insight into the portfolio.Industries and countries are also graded in a process which is incorporatedinto credit risk decisions through the facility risk grading system and bydirect consultation with originating officers. The Corporation's globalexposure system is utilized to monitor exposure by industry, obligor, businessunit, product, geographic region and risk grade. This data is integral to theprocess of formulating strategic portfolio direction. Risk management conducts independent evaluations of business unitportfolios and risk processes, reviewing compliance with risk policies,especially facility risk grading and problem credit recognition. Remedialactions for problem credits are the responsibility of the special loan group. Significant progress was made in 1993 on the Corporation's credit riskprofile. Credit quality indicators are favorable and improving, and the outlookfor 1994 is for these positive trends to continue.NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe following table sets forth the nonperforming assets of the Corporation atDecember 31, 1993 and 1992. The Corporation's total nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993 were$3,525 million, down 42% from $6,092 million at December 31, 1992. The declinefrom the prior year-end resulted from a $1,499 million decrease in non-LDCnonperforming loans, a $726 million decrease in LDC nonperforming loans and a$342 million decrease in assets acquired as loan satisfactions. TheCorporation's nonperforming assets do not include certain assets acquired inconnection with the First City Banks acquisition. See Note Seven of the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements. Management expects a further significantreduction in the level of nonperforming assets during 1994. B35  47 The following table presents the reconciliation of non-LDCnonperforming assets for 1993 and 1992.RECONCILIATION OF NON-LDC NONPERFORMING ASSETS(a) Excludes charge-offs on a formula basis.. Nonperforming LDC loans at December 31, 1993 were $622 million, adecrease of $726 million from the 1992 year-end. The decrease in nonperformingLDC loans principally reflected charge-offs, sales and swaps and the removal ofrestructured Argentine debt from nonaccrual status. For a further discussionwith respect to Argentina, see the Outstandings to Countries Engaged in DebtRescheduling section.[NONPERFORMING ASSETS BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX] As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation had consumer loans of $299million (which primarily consisted of credit card and installment loans), andcommercial loans of $24 million that were not characterized as nonperformingloans, although such loans were past due 90 days or more as to principal orinterest. The comparable amounts at December 31, 1992 included consumer loansof $303 million and commercial loans of $90 million. Consumer loans, exclusiveof residential mortgage loans, as to which interest or principal is past due 90days or more are generally not classified as nonperforming but, rather, arecharged off on a formula basis upon reaching certain specified stages ofdelinquency. A commercial loan on which interest or principal is past due 90days or more is not classified as nonperforming if the loan is consideredwell-secured (i.e., the collateral value is considered sufficient to cover theprincipal and accrued interest on the loan) and is in the process ofcollection. At each of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the past-due consumer andcommercial loans of the Corporation that were not characterized asnonperforming were substantially all domestic.ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSESThe allowance for losses is available to absorb potential credit losses fromthe entire loan portfolio, as well as from other balance sheet and off-balancesheet credit-related transactions. The appropriate level of the allowance isbased on analyses of the loan portfolio as well as other credit-related balancesheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments and reflects an amount which,in management's judgment, is adequate to provide for potential losses. Theanalyses include consideration of such factors as the risk rating of individualcredits, the size and diversity of the portfolio, particularly in terms ofindustry and geography, economic and political conditions, prior lossexperience and results of the Corporation's periodic credit reviews of itsportfolio. If deemed appropriate, as a result of such analyses, the allowancefor losses is increased or decreased by a charge or credit, respectively, toincome. The accompanying table reflects the activity in the allowance forlosses for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992.ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES(a) Includes $55 million related to the decision to accelerate the dispositionof certain nonperforming residential mortgages.(b) Related to First City Banks acquisition.B36  48 The Corporation's allowance for losses has been allocated between thenon-LDC and LDC portfolio segments. The Corporation's non-LDC allowance at the1993 year-end was $2.4 billion, or 3.35% of non-LDC loans outstanding, comparedwith $2.2 billion, or 2.83% of non-LDC loans outstanding, at December 31, 1992. The LDC allowance totaled $.6 billion at December 31, 1993, comparedwith $.8 billion at the end of 1992. The changes in the non-LDC and the LDCallowances during 1993 resulted primarily from the reallocation of $200 millionfrom the LDC allowance to the non-LDC allowance. The reallocation reflected theCorporation's ongoing analysis and evaluation of its LDC loan portfolio,including the finalization of the Argentine financing program and progress indebt negotiations with Brazil. In addition, during 1993, the Corporationallocated a specific portion of the LDC allowance for Brazilian outstandings asa result of the Corporation's evaluation of its refinancing country portfolioand in consideration of recent recommendations of the Interagency CountryExposure Review Committee ("ICERC"). At December 31, 1993, the balanceallocated to Brazil was $82 million. For further discussion of this allocation,see Note Six of the Consolidated Notes to the Financial Statements. The Corporation will continue to assess developments relating to thevarious LDC debt renegotiations. Continued progress in this area will allow theCorporation to evaluate its options with respect to the allowance currentlyallocated to the LDC portfolio. The following table reflects the Corporation's allowance coverageratios at December 31, 1993 and 1992.ALLOWANCE COVERAGE RATIOS The Corporation deems its allowance for losses at December 31, 1993 tobe adequate. Although the Corporation considers that it has sufficient reservesto absorb losses that may currently exist in the portfolio, but are not yetidentifiable, the precise loss content from the loan portfolio, as well as fromother balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit-related instruments, issubject to continuing review based on quality indicators, concentrations,changes in business conditions, and other external factors such as competition,legal and regulatory requirements. The Corporation will continue to reassessthe adequacy of the allowance for losses.NET CHARGE-OFFS(a) Includes charge-offs of $51 million related to loans to the formerrepublics of Yugoslavia (collectively "Yugoslavia"). For a discussion of net charge-offs, see the various credit portfoliosections. Management expects total non-LDC net charge-offs in 1994 to decreasesignificantly from the 1993 amount.COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOCommercial real estate loans represent loans secured primarily by realproperty, other than loans secured by one-to-four family residentialproperties, which are included in the consumer loan portfolio. Commercial realestate loans outstanding for the Corporation totaled $7.9 billion at December31, 1993, compared with $8.6 billion a year ago. The decrease during 1993 isattributable to repayments, transfers to real estate owned and charge-offs,partially offset by the addition of approximately $500 million of commercialreal estate loans acquired as part of the First City Banks acquisition. The table below indicates the composition of the commercial realestate loan portfolio. B37  49 Commercial mortgages provide financing for the acquisition orrefinancing of commercial properties, and typically have terms ranging fromthree to seven years. Construction loans are generally originated to financethe construction of real estate projects. When a loan financing the completedconstruction has cash flows sufficient to support a commercial mortgage, theloan is transferred from construction status to commercial mortgage status. The following table shows the Corporation's commercial real estateloan portfolio, nonperforming loans and foreclosed commercial real estate, byproperty type and geographic location.(a) Nonperforming loans are included in loan balances. Real Estate Owneddenotes foreclosed commercial real estate, which is included in assets acquiredas loan satisfactions.(b) Represents residential property construction, land development andmulti-family permanent mortgages, excluding 1-4 family residential mortgages. The largest concentration of commercial real estate loans is in theNew York/New Jersey and Texas markets, representing 48% and 23%, respectively,of the commercial real estate portfolio. No other state represented more than3% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. The New York/New Jerseyeconomy stabilized during 1993, resulting in moderate improvements incommercial space leasing activity. However, in most real estate propertysectors of that region, demand is not yet sufficient to result in higherprices. Improvements in the Texas economy have resulted in significant growthin employment (employment rates in Dallas and Austin are currently above thenational average) and in improvements in the real estate market. In California,where the Corporation has less than 3% of its commercial real estate loans, theeconomy is still weak. At December 31, 1993, the portfolio included $601million of secured international real estate loans which are primarily locatedin the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. The Corporation's management has a process to monitor all real estatecredits to assist it in early identification of problem loans. Line creditofficers work in conjunction with appraisers to review individual loans,conduct regular market analyses and evaluate portfolio segments. In addition,real estate problem assets are managed in special units staffed forrestructuring, workout and collection and real estate management anddisposition. The Corporation reassesses the market value of real estate ownedfor possible impairment on a continual basis. Nonperforming commercial real estate assets totaled $1.6 billion atDecember 31, 1993, a 34% decrease from a year ago. The decrease reflectsnonaccrual loans returning to accrual status, charge-offs and the continuingsale of foreclosed property. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans were$707 million, down 43% from $1,251 million at December 31, 1992. Real estateowned totaled $866 million at December 31, 1993, down 22% from $1,116 millionat December 31, 1992.B38  50 Improvement in nonperforming commercial real estate asset levelsduring 1993 is the result of increased liquidity in the commercial real estatemarkets, lower interest rates and successful focused workout activities. Commercial real estate loans entering nonperforming status declinedsignificantly in 1993 when compared with 1992. Reductions to nonperformingassets in the form of payments, return to accrual status and sales of realestate owned were greater than the additions to nonperforming assets in eachquarter of 1993. Commercial real estate net charge-offs in the 1993 totaled$284 million, compared with $354 million in 1992. Writedowns of commercial realestate owned totaled $199 million in 1993, compared with $212 million in 1992.Approximately $298 million in commercial real estate owned was sold in 1993.Generally, these assets were sold at or above carrying value. Commercial realestate net charge-offs, writedowns and nonperforming assets for 1994 areexpected to be below 1993 levels.COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIOThe commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $25.0 billion at December 31,1993, representing 33% of the total loan portfolio. The portfolio isdiversified geographically and by industry. Approximately 75% of the commercialand industrial loans are domestic. The commercial and industrial portfolio iscomprised of 39 industry groups which are graded and actively monitored by theCorporation's industry specialists. Approximately 70% of the industries eachrepresent less than 1% of total loans. The largest industry concentration isoil and gas at approximately 2.9% of total loans. Real estate related, ofapproximately $1.6 billion, is the second largest concentration representing2.2% of total loans. Included in commercial and industrial are loans related to highlyleveraged transactions ("HLT"). The Corporation originates and syndicates loansin HLTs, which include acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations.HLT loans at December 31, 1993 totaled approximately $1.9 billion, comparedwith $3.3 billion at December 31, 1992. The Corporation was also committed atDecember 31, 1993 to lend an additional amount of approximately $.9 billion.The substantial reduction in the HLT loan portfolio from year-end 1992 can belargely attributed to repayments, charge-offs and reclassifications to non-HLTstatus. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had $269 million in nonperformingHLT loans compared with $586 million at year-end 1992. Net charge-offs relatedto HLTs during 1993 totaled approximately $81 million, versus $185 million for1992.FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTSAND OFFICIAL INSTITUTIONS PORTFOLIOSFinancial institutions include commercial banks and companies whose businessesprimarily involve lending, financing, investing, underwriting or insuring.Loans to financial institutions were 11% of total loans at December 31, 1993.Fifty-seven percent of these loans were to domestic financial institutions.Loans to financial institutions are predominantly to commercial banks andbroker-dealers, which together comprise over half the financial institutiontotal. At year-end 1993, 7% of the Corporation's total loans were to foreigngovernments, government agencies, government-owned commercial enterprises, andofficial institutions, exclusive of LDC loans. Approximately 65% of foreigngovernment and official institution loans were to central and othergovernment-owned banks and government institutions.CONSUMER PORTFOLIOThe consumer loan portfolio consists of one-to-four family residentialmortgages, credit cards, installment loans and student loans. The consumerloan portfolio totaled $25.8 billion at December 31, 1993, representing 34% oftotal loans, an increase from $23.8 billion, or 29% of total loans, at December31, 1992. During 1993, the Corporation's consumer loan portfolio grew by 9%,primarily due to increases in credit card receivables and installment loans. The following table represents the composition of the Corporation'sconsumer loan portfolio at December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992. Underlying improvements in the economy in 1993 generally strengthenedthe financial position of the consumer. A healthier economy and easingemployment concerns stimulated revolving line and closed-end loan debt levels.Additionally, attractive mortgage rates stimulated home sales to first-timebuyers. Credit card receivables at December 31, 1993, increased $1.0 billionfrom a year ago, of which $443 million related to the co-branded ShellMasterCard program which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 1993. B39  51 Total nonperforming consumer loans at December 31, 1993 were $125million and were comprised of $101 million of loans secured by residential realestate and $24 million of installment loans. At December 31, 1992, totalnonperforming consumer loans were $241 million and were comprised of $210million of loans secured by residential real estate and $31 million ofinstallment loans. Residential real estate owned at December 31, 1993 totaled$20 million, compared with $57 million at the 1992 year-end. The reductions innonperforming consumer loans and residential real estate owned at December 31,1993 reflected the decision to accelerate the disposition of $162 million ofnonperforming residential mortgages. Net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio totaled $419 million in 1993compared with $401 million in 1992. The 1993 net charge-offs consisted of $322million in credit card receivables, $28 million in installment loans and $69million in residential mortgages (which included the $55 million chargeassociated with the aforementioned accelerated disposition). The composition ofthe 1992 net charge-offs were $348 million in credit card receivables, $35million in installment loans and $18 million in residential mortgages. Therewere essentially no credit losses in 1993 and 1992 in the student loanportfolio due to the existence of Federal and State government guarantees.Excluding the charge of $55 million for the accelerated disposition program,the decline in consumer loan charge-offs is due to the effect of furtherrefinement of the Corporation's risk management techniques, including enhancedaccount monitoring standards and greater efficiencies in the collection andrecovery processes. Consumer loan balances are expected to increase in 1994, particularlyin the residential mortgage and the credit card portfolios. In 1994, theCorporation's strategy will continue to emphasize risk management and consumerloan portfolio credit quality. Management expects consumer loan charge-offs in1994 will approximate the 1993 level due to the anticipated higher level ofcredit card receivables outstanding as a result of the Shell MasterCardprogram.Mortgage Banking Activities: With respect to the Corporation's mortgage bankingactivities, the Corporation both originates and services residential mortgageloans. After origination, the Corporation may sell loans to investors,primarily in the secondary market, while retaining the rights to service suchloans. In accordance with current accounting standards, the value of suchservicing rights related to originating mortgage loans is not recorded as anasset in the financial statements. The Corporation originated $14.7 billion ofmortgages in 1993 versus $12.5 billion in 1992. In addition to originating mortgage servicing rights, the Corporationalso purchases mortgage servicing rights. The Corporation may purchase bulkrights to service a loan portfolio or the Corporation may purchase loansdirectly and then sell such loans while retaining the servicing rights. TheCorporation's servicing portfolio amounted to $36.4 billion at December 31,1993 compared with $30.4 billion at December 31, 1992. Purchased mortgageservicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $249 million atDecember 31, 1993 compared with $204 million at December 31, 1992. The mortgageloans to which the Corporation's servicing rights relate are, to a substantialdegree, of recent vintage (i.e., originated within the past two years wheninterest rates have been relatively low). Additionally, the Corporationutilizes accelerated amortization and continually evaluates prepayment exposureof the portfolio, thereby adjusting the balance and remaining life of theservicing rights as a result of prepayments. Accordingly, the current interestrate environment has not had a material adverse effect on the carrying value ofthe Corporation's purchased mortgage servicing rights. During 1993, theCorporation wrote down $14 million with respect to its purchased mortgageservicing rights.CROSS-BORDER OUTSTANDINGSThe extension of credits denominated in a currency other than that of thecountry in which a borrower is located, such as dollar-denominated loans madeoverseas, are called "cross-border" credits. In addition to the credit riskassociated with any borrower, these particular credits are also subject to"country risk" -- economic and political risk factors specific to the countryof the borrower which may make the borrower unable or unwilling to payprincipal and interest according to contractual terms. Other risks associatedwith these credits include the possibility of insufficient foreign exchange andrestrictions on its availability. To minimize country risk, the Corporationmonitors its foreign credits in each country with specific consideration givento maturity, currency, industry and geographic concentration of the credits. Inaddition, the Corporation establishes limits governing lending to the variouscategories of the foreign portfolio. The following table lists all countries in which the Corporation'scross-border outstandings exceeded 1% of consolidated assets as of any of thedates specified. The Corporation does not have significant local currencyoutstandings to the individual countries listed in the following table that arenot hedged or are not funded by local currency borrowings.B40  52(a) Outstandings (including loans and accrued interest, interest-bearingdeposits with banks, securities, acceptances and other monetary assets, exceptequity investments) represent those of both the public and private sectors andare presented on a risk basis, i.e., net of written guarantees and tangibleliquid collateral when held outside the foreign country. At December 31, 1993,outstandings to Italy amounted to $1,281 million which was in excess of .75% oftotal assets. At December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, outstandings to Brazilamounted to $1,328 million, $1,224 million and $1,148 million, respectively,which were in excess of .75% of total assets in each of such year. At December31, 1992, outstandings to Korea amounted to $1,074 million, which were inexcess of .75% of total assets. At December 31, 1991, outstandings to Venezuelaamounted to $1,162 million, which was in excess of .75% of total assets forsuch year.(b) Outstandings exclude equity received in debt-for-equity conversions, whichis recorded initially at fair market value and generally accounted for underthe cost method. Commitments (outstanding letters of credit, standby letters ofcredit, guarantees and unused legal commitments) are excluded. At December 31,1993, off-balance sheet commitments, after adjusting for transfers of risk,amounted to $1,133 million for Japan, $1,247 million for the United Kingdom,and $357 million for Germany.(c) The average outstandings to Japan during 1993 and 1992 (based onquarter-end amounts) was approximately $3.6 billion and $1.2 billion,respectively.(d) The average outstandings to Germany during 1993 (based on quarter-endamounts) was approximately $1.2 billion.OUTSTANDINGS TO COUNTRIES ENGAGED IN DEBT RESCHEDULINGThe following table sets forth the Corporation's outstandings to countriesengaged in debt rescheduling at the dates indicated.(a) Trade and short-term outstandings include accrued interest,interest-bearing deposits with banks and trade-related credits.(b) Amounts outstanding to Venezuela exclude interest rate reduction bonds witha book value of $365 million and $483 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,respectively. The principal amount of these bonds is secured by zero-couponU.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 1993, the market values of thesebonds and the underlying collateral were $292 million and $65 million,respectively.(c) Amounts outstanding to Argentina exclude principal reduction bonds andinterest rate reduction bonds with an aggregate book value of $17 million atDecember 31, 1993. The principal amount of these bonds is secured byzero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 1993, the marketvalues of these bonds and the underlying collateral were $17 million and $4million, respectively.(d) Amounts outstanding to Uruguay exclude interest rate reduction bonds with abook value of $129 million at each of December 31, 1993 and 1992. The principalamount of these bonds is secured by zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities. As ofDecember 31, 1993, the market values of these bonds and the underlyingcollateral were $108 million and $20 million, respectively. LDC outstandings are subject to unique economic, political and socialrisks. In 1993 and prior years, borrowers in LDC countries have restructuredand refinanced their obligations. The Corporation expects to continue a programof close cooperation with members of the international financial community andthe representatives of LDC countries. The Corporation's medium- and long-term LDC outstandings decreased to$2,248 million at December 31, 1993, from $3,463 million at December 31, 1992,a reduction of $1,215 million, or 35%. The reduction from December 31, 1992 isprimarily attributable to loan sales, charge-offs, and the removal of theArgentine debt that was restructured in 1993. Following is a summary of significant recent developments with respectto the Corporation's outstandings to Brazil and Argentina.Brazil: Nonperforming loans to Brazilian borrowers totaled $403 million atDecember 31, 1993, down from $713 million at December 31, 1992, reflecting areduction in medium- and long-term outstandings. Substantial progress was made during 1993 on theagreement-in-principal reached in July 1992 between the Government of Braziland the Bank Advisory Committee ("BAC") on the debt and debt service reductionpackage covering $45 billion of medium- and long-term debt (the "FinancingPackage"). B41  53During 1993, the Corporation agreed to exchange its eligible "Old" debt(multi-year Deposit Facility Agreement and other pre-1988 restructured debt)for 65% Capitalization Bonds and 35% Discount Bonds. The agreement alsoprovides for the exchange of the Corporation's eligible "New Money" debt(credit extensions originating from the 1988 restructuring) for New MoneyBonds, Debt Conversion Bonds and Cruzeiro Dollar Bonds. The Financing Packagewas signed by 95% of the debt holders on December 15, 1993. The exchange isexpected to take place by April 15, 1994. Brazil has paid 50% of contractual interest due throughout 1993 and isexpected to continue these 50% payments until the exchange date. The remainingunpaid interest due is expected to be received by the Corporation on theexchange date in the form of 12-year, uncollateralized Eligible Interest("EI's") Bonds in the principal amount of approximately $150 million. The Corporation's total Brazilian outstandings currently affected bythe Financing Package amount to $1,112 million (which includes loan amountspreviously charged off). Debt tendered under the Capitalization Bonds optionwill be exchanged at face value for 20-year uncollateralized bonds initiallybearing interest at 4% and gradually increasing to 8% in year seven andthereafter. The principal balance of the bonds will be increased semi-annuallyduring the first six years for the difference between the interest due based onthe stated rate and the rate of 8%. Equal semi-annual principal payments willcommence after a ten-year grace period. Debt tendered under the Discount Bondoption will be exchanged at a 35% discount for 30-year bonds bearing interestat LIBOR plus 13/16% with a bullet payment at maturity. The principal paymenton the Discount Bonds is expected to be collateralized by zero-coupon U.S.Treasury obligations having a redemption value at maturity equal to the facevalue of the Bonds. Interest payments on these bonds are expected to becollateralized by permitted investments on a 12- month rolling basis and willbecome fully collateralized during a two-year phase-in period. The New MoneyBonds, Debt Conversion Bonds and Cruzeiro Dollar Bonds are uncollateralized 15-or 17-year instruments bearing interest at LIBOR plus 13/16% with equalsemi-annual principal payments commencing after a seven- or ten-year graceperiod. The Corporation does not expect to incur any additional charge-offs asa result of the Financing Package. The Corporation has sold substantially all of its Interest Due andUnpaid ("IDU") Bonds which were received in November 1992 under the agreementreached by the BAC and Brazil for the settlement of past-due interest owed tobank creditors on medium- and long-term outstandings for 1989 and 1990. During1993, the Corporation recognized a gain of $152 million (in other revenue) fromthe sale of its IDU Bonds.Argentina: Argentine nonperforming loans were $7 million at December 31, 1993compared with $316 million at December 31, 1992. The decrease in medium- andthe long-term outstandings and in nonperforming loans is primarily attributableto the exchange of eligible debt for 30-year collateralized Par and DiscountBonds issued by the Republic of Argentina and the sale of local Argentinegovernment instruments. The rescheduling agreement reached between the Republic of Argentinaand the Bank Advisory Committee on the settlement of the country's medium- andlong-term debt of approximately $23 billion and associated interest in arrearswas completed during 1993. On April 7, 1993, the creditor banks exchangedtheir eligible debt into collateralized 30 year Par and Discount Bonds underthe terms of the Argentine rescheduling agreement. The Corporation's totalArgentine outstandings affected by the rescheduling agreement were $870 million(which includes loan amounts previously charged off). Par Bonds in the amountof $613 million and Discount Bonds in the amount of $167 million were issued tothe Corporation. The Corporation did not take any additional charge-offs inconnection with the debt exchange. In connection with the agreement, theCorporation received $337 million of Floating Rate Bonds ("FRB's") and $32million in cash, of which $29 million was recorded in net interest income in1993. The Corporation has sold substantially all of the aforementioned ParBonds, Discount Bonds and FRB's received as a result of the refinancingagreement. The Corporation recognized a $179 million gain (in other revenue)during 1993 from the sale of its FRB's.CAPITALTotal stockholders' equity at December 31, 1993 was $11.16 billion, an increasefrom $9.85 billion at year-end 1992. The $1.31 billion increase instockholders' equity from December 31, 1992 included $1.11 billion in retainedearnings generated during 1993. The Corporation raised $200 million in newcommon equity primarily through the sale in March 1993 of[TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX]B42  543.8 million shares of the Corporation's common stock. Two series of fixed-ratepreferred stock totaling $400 million issued during 1993 were more than offsetby the redemption of three series of adjustable-rate preferred stock totaling$594 million. Such redemptions were part of the Corporation's plan to improveits capital position by achieving lower financing costs and reducinginterest-rate risk. The Corporation will continue to evaluate the opportunityfor future redemptions of preferred stock given current market conditions. TheCorporation's ratio of common stockholders' equity to total assets was 6.34% atDecember 31, 1993, an increase from 5.73% at year end 1992. The ratio of totalstockholders' equity to total assets at December 31, 1993 was 7.45%, anincrease from 7.05% from the same date a year ago. Total capitalization (total stockholders' equity under risk-basedcapital guidelines, and subordinated and senior debt that qualifies as Tier 2Capital as discussed below under "Risk-Based Capital Ratios") increased by $810million during 1993.LONG-TERM DEBTDuring 1993, the Corporation issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt (including$1.6 billion of subordinated debt that qualifies as Tier 2 Capital, of which$1.1 billion was issued through its Chemical Bank subsidiary). These issuanceswere offset by maturities of $402 million of long-term debt (including $330million of medium-term notes) and the redemption of $1.9 billion of long-termdebt. As a result of these actions, the Corporation improved its liquidity andextended the maturities of its debt portfolio. See the Liquidity Managementsection for further discussion of the Corporation's long-term debt redemptions.COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDSIn the first quarter of 1993, the Board of Directors of the Corporationincreased the quarterly dividend on the Corporation's common stock from $0.30per share to $0.33 per share. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Corporationdeclared an increase in the quarterly dividend to be paid on its common stockin January 1994 from $0.33 per share to $0.38 per share. Future dividendpolicies will be determined by the Board of Directors in light of the earningsand financial condition of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and otherfactors, including applicable governmental regulations and policies.RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOSUnder the Federal Reserve Board risk-based capital guidelines, bankingorganizations are required to maintain certain ratios of "Qualifying Capital"to "risk-weighted assets". "Qualifying Capital" is classified into two tiers,referred to as Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital. Tier 1 Capital consists ofcommon equity, qualifying perpetual preferred equity and minority interests inthe equity accounts of unconsolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and othernon-qualifying intangible assets. Tier 2 Capital consists of perpetualpreferred equity not qualifying for Tier 1, qualifying allowance for creditlosses, mandatory convertible debt and subordinated debt and other qualifyingsecurities. The amount of Tier 2 Capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1Capital. In calculating "risk-weighted assets", certain risk percentages, asspecified by the Federal Reserve Board, are applied to particular categories ofboth on- and off-balance sheet assets. Under the guidelines, the Corporation'sTier 1 Capital ratio and Total Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets atDecember 31, 1993 were 8.12% and 12.22%, respectively, well in excess of theminimum ratios specified by the Federal Reserve Board. Also on that date,Chemical Bank's ratios of Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital to risk-weightedassets, were 7.90% and 12.54%, respectively. Chemical Bank was "wellcapitalized" as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. To be "well capitalized,"a banking organization must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, TotalCapital ratio of at least 10% and Tier 1 leverage ratio (as defined in thefollowing section) of at least 5%. These ratios, as well as the leverage ratio discussed below, do notreflect any adjustment in stockholders' equity due to the adoption of SFAS No.115. The Federal Reserve Board has proposed to permit banking corporations toinclude in Tier 1 Capital the net amount of any unrealized gains or losses fromsecurities available-for-sale. If the Corporation were to treat the amount atDecember 31, 1993 of its net unrealized gains attributable toavailable-for-sale securities as regulatory capital, the Tier 1 Capital, TotalCapital and Tier 1 leverage ratios would be 8.30%, 12.39% and 6.92%,respectively, at December 31, 1993. The total capitalization would haveincreased by an additional $215 million for a total increase of $1,025 millionduring 1993.[RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS BAR GRAPH -- SEE EDGAR APPENDIX] B43  55LEVERAGE RATIOSThe Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 Capital divided by average totalassets (net of allowance for losses, goodwill and other non-qualifyingintangible assets). The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for banking organizationsthat do not anticipate significant growth and that have well-diversified risk(including no undue interest rate risk), excellent asset quality, highliquidity and good earnings. Higher capital ratios could be required ifwarranted by the particular circumstances, or risk profile, of a given bankingorganization. The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Corporation of anyspecific minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to it. The Corporation's Tier1 leverage ratio was 6.77% at December 31, 1993, compared with 6.60% atDecember 31, 1992. At December 31, 1993, Chemical Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 6.97%. The table which follows sets forth the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital,Tier 2 Capital and risk-weighted assets, and the Corporation's risk-basedcapital and Tier 1 leverage ratios for the dates indicated.CAPITAL RATIOSExcluding the Corporation's securities subsidiary, Chemical Securities Inc.,the December 31, 1993 ratios of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets andTotal Capital to risk-weighted assets were 7.93% and 11.86%, respectively,compared with 7.20% and 11.29%, respectively, at December 31, 1992.LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTThe objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability ofsufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize onopportunities for business expansion. Liquidity management addresses theCorporation's ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or atcontractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature, and to make new loansand investments as opportunities arise. Liquidity is managed on a daily basisat both the parent company and the subsidiary levels, enabling seniormanagement to monitor effectively changes in liquidity and to react accordinglyto fluctuations in market conditions. Contingency plans exist and could beimplemented on a timely basis to minimize the risk associated with dramaticchanges in market conditions. The primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of theCorporation derives from their ability to generate core deposits, whichincludes all deposits except zero-rate deposits, foreign deposits andcertificates of deposit of $100,000 or more. The Corporation considers fundsfrom such retail sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit basebecause of the historical stability of such sources of funds. The average coredeposits at the Corporation's bank subsidiaries for 1993 were $61 billion, anincrease from $57 billion for 1992. These deposits fund a proportion of theCorporation's asset base, thereby reducing the Corporation's reliance on other,more volatile, sources of funds. For 1993, the Corporation's percentage ofaverage core deposits to average interest-earning assets was 49%, compared with47% during 1992. Average core deposits as a percentage of average loans was 77%for 1993, compared with 70% in 1992. The Corporation holds marketable securities and other short-terminvestments which can be readily converted to cash. In addition, active assetsecuritization programs and loan syndication networks are maintained in orderto facilitate the timely liquidation of certain assets if and when deemeddesirable. The Corporation is also an active participant in the capital markets.In addition to issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes, the Corporationraises funds through the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and preferredstock. During 1993, the Corporation issued $200 million of common stock, $400million of preferred stock, $1.6 billion of subordinated debt ($1.1 billion ofwhich was issued by Chemical Bank) and $1.9 billion of senior debt (including$1.1 billion through its medium-term note program) in various public offerings. During 1993 and 1992, several nationally-recognized statistical ratingorganizations announced upgrades in the ratings of the Corporation's seniordebt, subordinated debt, commercial paper and preferred stock. These ratingincreases enhanced and should continue to enhance the Corporation's access toglobal capital and money markets, a primary source of liquidity for aninternational money-center institution. The ability to access thisgeographically diverse assortment of distribution channels and to issue a widevariety of capital and money market instruments at various maturities providesthe Corporation with a full array of alternatives for managing its liquidityposition. During 1993, the Corporation redeemed $1.9 billion of its long-termdebt and $594 million of its preferred stock. Such redemptions were and willcontinue to be undertaken by the Corporation in light of its ability (as aresult of current market conditions in general and the recent upgrades in theCorpora-B44  56tion's debt ratings in particular) to access the credit markets on terms morefavorable than that of the redeemed debt and preferred stock. These redemptionswere and continue to be part of the Corporation's plan to improve its capitalposition by achieving lower financing costs, reducing interest rate risk andlengthening maturities. The Corporation will continue to evaluate theopportunity for future redemptions of debt and preferred stock given currentmarket conditions. The following comments apply to the Consolidated Statement of CashFlows. Cash and due from banks decreased $2.0 billion during 1993, as netcash used by operating activities exceeded the net cash provided by investingand financing activities. The $8.5 billion net cash used by operatingactivities was principally due to cash outflows from a net increase intrading-related assets ($10.5 billion) and purchases of available-for-salesecurities ($7.6 billion), partially offset by the maturity and sale ofavailable-for-sale securities ($1.6 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively).The $.4 billion net cash provided from investing activities was largely theresult of cash inflows from the net decrease in loans ($6.7 billion) andproceeds from the maturity of held-to-maturity securities ($5.0 billion),partially offset by cash outflows from the purchases of held-to-maturitysecurities ($6.4 billion), as well as increases in deposits with banks ($4.2billion) and Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resaleagreements ($2.4 billion). The $6.0 billion net cash provided by financingactivities was due to increases in Federal funds purchased, securities soldunder repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds ($3.3 billion), foreigndeposits ($2.9 billion) and net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt($3.5 billion), partially offset by repayments and maturities of long-term debt($2.3 billion). The Corporation's anticipated cash requirements (on a parentcompany-only basis) for 1994 include approximately $1,650 million for maturingmedium- and long-term debt, anticipated dividend payments on the Corporation'scommon stock and preferred stock and for other parent company operations. TheCorporation considers the sources of liquidity available to the parent companyto be more than sufficient to meet its obligations. The sources of liquidityavailable to the Corporation (on a parent company-only basis) include itsliquid assets (including deposits with its bank subsidiaries and short-termadvances to and repurchase agreements with its securities subsidiaries) as wellas dividends and the repayment of intercompany advances from its bank andnon-bank subsidiaries. In addition, as of December 31, 1993, the Corporationhad available to it $750 million in committed credit facilities from asyndicate of domestic and international banks. The facilities included a $241million three-year facility and a $509 million 364-day facility.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ANALYSISThe Corporation utilizes various off-balance sheet financial instruments in twoways: trading and asset/liability management. Certain of these instruments,commonly referred to as "derivatives", represent contracts with counterpartieswhere payments are made to or from the counterparty based upon specificinterest rates, currency levels, other market rates or on terms predeterminedby the contract. Derivatives, along with foreign exchange contracts, canprovide a cost-effective alternative to assuming and mitigating risksassociated with traditional on-balance sheet instruments. Such derivative andforeign exchange transactions involve, to varying degrees, credit risk (i.e.,the possibility that a loss may occur because a party to a transaction fails toperform according to the terms of a contract) and market risk (i.e., thepossibility that a change in interest or currency rates will cause the value ofa financial instrument to decrease or become more costly to settle). The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from such transactionshave been immaterial during 1993, 1992 and 1991. The effects of market losseshave been reflected in trading revenue, as the trading instruments aremarked-to-market on a daily basis.TRADING ACTIVITIES: RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTSThe Corporation utilizes derivative and foreign exchange instruments to meetthe financing needs of its customers and to generate revenues through itstrading activities. The Corporation has four fundamental trading activitieswhich generate revenue. The Corporation seeks to maintain a balance betweengenerally stable market-making, sales and arbitrage businesses and potentiallyless stable positioning.Market-making: The Corporation trades with the intention of making a profitbased on the spread between bid and ask prices. The Corporation views themarket risk related to market-making to be relatively low and very short-term.The stability of market-making, compared to other trading activities, isconsidered by the Corporation to be medium, as both the spreads and the marketvolume can fluctuate. The Corporation considers market-making to be a keytrading activity in its non-exchange traded businesses and emphasizes its use,especially in its foreign exchange, derivative and government marketsbusinesses.Sales: The Corporation accesses products for its clients at competitive prices.The Corporation is emphasizing sales since the Corporation believes it to be astable business, given the Corporation's worldwide client franchise.Arbitrage: This is the purchase or sale of derivatives in one market and thealmost simultaneous sale or purchase in another market to take advantage ofdifferences in interest and currency B45  57rates. Because of the nature of trading markets, where there are numerousinstruments that relate to one another, and the Corporation's market-makingfranchise, the Corporation emphasizes the use of this strategy. The Corporationconsiders arbitrage to be a key fundamental of its risk management business.Positioning: The Corporation takes certain positions in the market with theintention of generating revenue. This strategy has the lowest stability of allfour trading activities. The Corporation's emphasis in this area is less thanin the other fundamental trading activities.ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTThe Corporation employs a variety of off-balance sheet instruments in managingits exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates and foreign exchangerates. In some cases, these instruments are used to hedge specific on-balancesheet exposures. For example, an interest rate swap contract may be enteredinto in conjunction with a debt offering, shifting the effective rate paid fromfixed to variable, or vice versa, at terms more advantageous than if the debtoffering had originally been fixed-rate or variable-rate, as the case may be. More often, these contracts are used as one of many tools in theCorporation's overall management of its exposure, as opposed to hedgingspecific transactions as described above. A swap in which the Corporationreceives a fixed interest rate and pays a floating rate may serve as asubstitute for an investment in a fixed-rate security. Such a swap transactionwill have an effect on the Corporation's consolidated interest rate sensitivityidentical to a security investment but potentially at more favorable termsdepending on market conditions. For a discussion regarding the Corporation'sinterest rate positions, see the Interest Rate Sensitivity Section. For adiscussion regarding the Corporation's asset/liability management policies, seeNote One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31,1993, the net deferred amount relating to off-balance sheet instruments used inasset/liability management activities was immaterial.CREDIT AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTThe effective management of credit and market risk is a vital ingredient of theCorporation's trading activities and asset/liability management. TheCorporation also manages the risks associated with its trading activitiesthrough geographic and product diversification. Because of the changing marketenvironment, which results in increasingly complex financial instruments, andbecause of the Corporation's business strategy to maintain geographic andproduct diversification, the monitoring and managing of these risks is acontinual process. The Corporation has reviewed both the Group of Thirty reportentitled "Derivatives Practices and Principles" and the recently issued FederalReserve Board examination guidelines for trading activities, and managementconsiders itself to be substantially in compliance with the recommendations andgeneral thrust of these documents.Credit Risk: The Corporation controls the credit risk arising from derivativeand foreign exchange transactions through its credit approval process and theuse of risk control limits and monitoring procedures. The Corporation uses thesame credit procedures when entering into derivative and foreign exchangetransactions as it does for traditional lending products. The credit approvalprocess involves first evaluating each counterparty's creditworthiness, thenassessing the applicability of off-balance sheet instruments to the risks thecounterparty is attempting to manage, and determining if there are specifictransaction characteristics which alter the risk profile. Credit limits arecalculated and monitored on the basis of potential exposure which takes intoconsideration current market value and estimates of potential future movementsin market values. The notional principal of derivative and foreign exchange instrumentsis the amount on which interest and other payments in a transaction are based.For derivative transactions, the notional principal typically does not changehands; it is simply a quantity that is used to calculate payments. Whilenotional principal is the most commonly used volume measure in the derivativeand foreign exchange markets, it is not a measure of credit or market risk. Thenotional principal of the Corporation's derivatives and foreign exchangeproducts greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arisefrom such transactions. As a result, the Corporation does not consider thenotional principal to be indicative of its credit or market risk exposure. TheCorporation believes the true measure of credit risk exposure is thereplacement cost (the cost to replace the contract at current market ratesshould the counterparty default prior to the settlement date). This is alsoreferred to as the mark-to-market exposure amount. Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the valueof a derivative or foreign exchange contract in the open market. When themark-to-market is positive, it indicates the counterparty owes the Corporationand, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Corporation. When themark-to-market is negative, the Corporation owes the counterparty. In thissituation the Corporation does not have repayment risk. When the Corporation has more than one transaction outstanding with acounterparty, the "net" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of thepositive and negative exposures with the same counterparty. If there is a netnegative number, the Corporation's exposure to the counterparty is consideredzero. Net mark-to-market is the best measure of credit risk when there is amaster netting agreement between the Corporation and the counterparty.B46  58 The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchangeproduct transactions with regulated financial institutions, which it believeshave relatively low credit risk. At December 31, 1993, over 80% of transactioncounterparties were commercial banks. The remaining 20% were comprised mainlyof other financial institutions and major corporations. The Corporation's trading activities are geographically diverse.Trading activities are undertaken in more than 20 countries, although amajority of the Corporation's transactions are executed in the United States,Japan and Western Europe, areas which the Corporation believes have the mostdeveloped laws regarding derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. Tradingproducts include not only foreign exchange and derivatives but also securities,including LDC debt. The majority of derivative and foreign exchange transactions areoutstanding for less than one year. At December 31, 1993, 28% of outstandingtransactions were scheduled to expire within three months, 13% within three tosix months, 13% within six months to one year, 26% within one to three yearsand 20% greater than three years. The short-term nature of these transactionsalong with product diversification mitigates credit risk, as transactionssettle quickly.Market Risk: Market risk management is an effective and wide-ranging activityat the Corporation. A critical goal is the separation of duties of thoseresponsible for day-to-day trading and those responsible for position valuationand limit reporting. The Chairman of the Market Risk Committee delegates instrumentauthorities and risk limits to individual business units and exceptionauthority to the senior managers of divisions responsible for those units.Procedures and policies specify authorized instruments and provide for risklimits. Critical risk limits that are designated as primary involve independentdaily tracking and centralized reporting, while less-critical risk limits areindependently monitored and are reported centrally on a periodic basis.Individual business units often set additional internal limits that aremonitored in the same manner. Criteria for risk limit determination include,among other factors, relevant market analysis, prior track record, businessstrategy, and management experience and depth. The Chairman of the Market Risk Committee is supported by the MarketRisk Group. One focus of the group is independent analysis of instrumentauthority and limit requests, limit utilization, measure of revenue to risk,average risk levels, and related topics. Other focuses include measures ofvalue at risk, criteria for official volatility and correlation statistics, andformulas for determination of market-related credit exposure. Additionally, thegroup reviews the market risk related to new products (as one element of theCorporation's new product process) and provides independent review of themathematical and simulation models utilized by the Corporation. The groupcombines efforts with other functional units to assess cross-discipline risksin business units having significant market risk. For further discussion of the Corporation's off-balance sheetfinancial instruments, see Note Eighteen of the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements.INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITYThe Corporation's net interest income is affected by changes in the level ofmarket interest rates based upon mismatches between the repricing of its assetsand liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity arises in the ordinary course of theCorporation's banking business as the repricing characteristics of its loans donot necessarily match those of its deposits and other borrowings. Thissensitivity can be altered by adjusting investments and the maturities ofwholesale funding and with the use of off-balance sheet derivative instruments. Interest rate sensitivity is managed and controlled on a consolidatedbasis by the Corporation's Asset and Liability Policy Committee. A key elementof the Corporation's interest rate risk management strategy is that it allowsthe assumption of limited interest rate sensitivities at a decentralized levelby authorized units with close contacts with the markets. These units operatewithin authorities administered centrally which limit the size of exposures bycurrency and the instruments that can be used to manage the sensitivity. Thepositions are consolidated and reviewed frequently by the Asset and LiabilityPolicy Committee, which seeks to maximize the Corporation's net interest incomewhile ensuring that the risks to earnings from adverse movements in interestrates are kept within pre-specified limits deemed acceptable by theCorporation.Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: Management uses a variety of techniques tomeasure its interest rate sensitivity. One such tool is aggregate net gapanalysis, an example of which is presented below. Assets and liabilities areplaced in maturity ladders based on their contractual maturities or repricingdates. Assets and liabilities for which no specific contractual maturity orrepricing dates exist are placed in ladders based on management's judgmentsconcerning their most likely repricing behaviors. Derivatives used in interest rate sensitivity management are alsoincluded in the maturity ladders. The aggregate notional amounts of derivativesare netted when the repricing of the "receive-side" and "pay-side" of two swapsoccur within the same gap interval. Such net amount represents the repricingmismatch of the Corporation's derivatives during the particular gap interval.It is the amount of the net repricing mismatch, rather than the aggregatenotional principal of the derivatives repricing during the period, that isincluded in the gap analysis, because it is the amount of the mismatch thatreflects the impact of the Corporation's derivatives in altering the repricingprofile of the Corporation. See Note Eighteen of the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for the aggregate notional principal of off-balance sheetinstruments used for asset/liability management. B47  59(a) Represents repricing effect of off-balance sheet positions, which includeinterest rate swaps and options, financial futures, and similar agreements thatare used as part of the Corporation's overall asset and liability managementactivities. A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting theliabilities repricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negativegap -- more liabilities repricing than assets -- will benefit net interestincome in a declining interest rate environment and will detract from netinterest income in a rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positivegap -- more assets repricing than liabilities -- will benefit net interestincome if rates are rising and will detract from net interest income in afalling rate environment. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had $7,912 million moreliabilities than assets repricing within one year, amounting to 5.3% of totalassets. This compares with $7,255 million, or 5.2% of total assets at December31, 1992. The consolidated gaps include exposure to U.S. dollar interest ratesas well as exposure to non-U.S. dollar rates in currency markets in which theCorporation does business. Since U.S. interest rates and non-U.S. interestrates do not move in tandem, the overall cumulative gaps will tend to overstatethe exposures of the Corporation to U.S. interest rates. Simple gap analysis measures the Corporation's exposure at aparticular point in time. The exposure changes continuously as a result of theCorporation's ongoing business and its management initiatives. Moreover, gapanalysis cannot reveal the impact of factors such as administered rates (i.e.,the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on its consumer and businessdeposits, changes in balance sheet mix or various options embedded in thebalance sheet. Accordingly, the Asset and Liability Policy Committeesupplements its gap analysis with comprehensive simulations of net interestincome under a variety of market interest rate scenarios. These simulationmodels take explicit account of pricing strategies and deposit responses andthe behavior of embedded options. At December 31, 1993, based on thesesimulations, netB48  60interest income sensitivity to a gradual 150 basis point rise in market ratesover the course of 1994 was estimated at less than two percent of projected1994 after-tax net income. While management believes the simulation models do provide ameaningful representation of the Corporation's interest rate sensitivity, thesesimulation models do not necessarily take into account all businessdevelopments which can have an impact on net interest income, such as changesin credit quality or the size and composition of the balance sheet. In 1993, the Federal Reserve Board and certain other Federal bankingregulators proposed a system for measuring interest rate risk and assessingcapital adequacy based on the sensitivity of a banking organization's "neteconomic value" to changes in the level of market interest rates. The systemcompares the net present value of net interest income-related cash flows undercurrent market conditions to the net present values under hypothetical,instantaneous increases and declines in market rates. The proposal envisionsthat banks whose net economic value sensitivity exceeds one percent of totalassets would be identified as having excessive interest rate risk and,potentially, become subject to additional capital requirements. While finalrules have not been adopted, management believes its current interestrate-sensitivity position falls within the range deemed acceptable by theregulators' measurement system.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOANIn May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, ("FASB") issuedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditorsfor Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS 114"). SFAS 114 requires that the carryingvalue of impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expectedfuture cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as apractical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value ofthe collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Under the new standard, aloan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probablethat the borrower will be unable to pay contractual interest or principalpayments as scheduled in the loan agreement. SFAS 114 is applicable to allloans that are identified for evaluation, uncollateralized as well ascollateralized, with certain exceptions. SFAS 114 applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginningafter December 15, 1994, although earlier application is encouraged. Managementis currently evaluating the financial impact of adopting this new accountingstandard.OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTSThe Corporation records unrealized gains and losses related to interest rateand foreign exchange contracts net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In March 1992, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting ofAmounts Related to Certain Contracts" (the "Interpretation"), with an effectivedate of January 1, 1994, which changes the reporting of unrealized gains andlosses on interest rate and foreign exchange contracts on the balance sheet.The Interpretation requires that gross unrealized gains be reported as assetsand gross unrealized losses be reported as liabilities. The Interpretation,however, permits netting of such unrealized gains and losses with the samecounterparty when master netting agreements have been executed. If thisInterpretation had been in effect at December 31, 1993, giving effect to themaster netting agreements in place at that time, assets and liabilities eachwould have increased by approximately $13.6 billion and the Tier 1 leverageratio would have been 6.19%. In 1994, to mitigate the impact of theInterpretation, the Corporation anticipates expanding the number of masternetting agreements to which it is a party. Upon adoption of this new reportingrequirement, the Corporation's net income and risk-based capital ratios willnot be affected, although the Corporation expects its asset-based ratios (suchas the Tier 1 leverage ratio) will decrease.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCOMPARISON BETWEEN 1992 AND 1991OPERATING HIGHLIGHTSThe Corporation's net income was $1,086 million, or $3.90 per common share, for1992, compared with $154 million, or $.11 per share, in 1991. The 1991 resultsreflected a pre-tax restructuring charge of $625 million taken in connectionwith the merger with MHC. Excluding the restructuring charge, earnings for1991 were $779 million, or $3.56 per share. There were no tax benefits recordedin connection with the restructuring charge. The Corporation's 1992 earnings, in comparison with the prior year,benefited from a 13% increase in net interest income, a 27% improvement incombined trading account and foreign exchange revenue, as well as higherrevenues from fees for other banking services, service charges on depositaccounts and trust and investment management fees. Partially offsetting thesefactors were higher credit costs in 1992 compared with 1991, reflecting theimpact of the weak economy on certain areas of the Corporation's creditportfolio. B49  61NET INTEREST INCOMEThe Corporation's net interest income was $4,598 million in 1992, an increaseof 13% from $4,080 million for 1991. The improvement in net interest incomefrom 1991 was attributable to wider spreads in a lower interest rateenvironment, lower funding costs (primarily due to upgrades received in 1992 inthe Corporation's credit ratings) and effective asset/liability management.PROVISION FOR LOSSES AND NET CHARGE-OFFSThe provision for losses for 1992 was $1,365 million, compared with $1,345million for 1991. The Corporation's non-LDC net charge-offs totaled $1,365 million in1992 an increase from $1,191 million in 1991. The increase from the prior yearwas principally due to the continued weak economy and its effects on certainareas of the Corporation's credit portfolio. However, non-LDC net charge-offsdeclined in each of the last three quarters of 1992. LDC net charge-offs in 1992 included $51 million related to Yugoslaviaas a result of a recommendation of ICERC issued in the 1992 fourth quarter. LDCnet charge-offs and losses on sales and swaps in 1991 included $902 millionrelated to Brazilian loans, of which $491 million occurred in the 1991 fourthquarter. These charge-offs reflected the Corporation's evaluation of its LDCportfolio and the recommendations of ICERC and had the effect of adjusting theCorporation's medium- and long-term Brazilian outstandings to an estimated netrecoverable value.NONINTEREST REVENUENoninterest revenue totaled $3,026 million in 1992, an increase of $164 millionfrom 1991. The increase was primarily the result of higher foreign exchangetrading revenue, service charges on deposit accounts and fees for other bankingservices, partially offset by lower securities gains, corporate finance andsyndication fees and other revenue. Trust and investment management fees increased in 1992 to $361 millionfrom $344 million in 1991. The improvement from the prior year occurred in thestock transfer and corporate trust businesses and also reflected higherpersonal trust fees due to a rise in the market value of assets undermanagement. Corporate finance and syndication fees in 1992 were $265 million, adecrease of 12% from 1991. The decline principally resulted from the sale of anonstrategic business in the fourth quarter of 1991. Service charges on deposit accounts were $264 million in 1992, anincrease from $229 million in 1991. This increase resulted from higherper-account fees, as well as growth in the Corporation's domestic depositaccounts. Fees for other banking services include revolving credit fees,commissions on letters of credit, fees in lieu of compensating balances,mortgage servicing fees, loan commitment fees and other transactional feerevenue. Such fees totaled $1,040 million in 1992, an increase from $959million in 1991. The increase from the prior year reflected growth in a numberof fee components, as well as the prospective reclassification of certainbanking relationship fees from other revenue to fees for other bankingservices. Revenues from all trading activities (trading account revenue andforeign exchange revenue) were $853 million in 1992 compared with $671 millionin 1991. In 1992, trading account revenue and foreign exchange revenue were$377 million and $476 million, respectively, compared with $382 million and$289 million, respectively, in 1991. The increases were primarily the result ofincreased transaction volumes, market volatility, and the Corporation's highercredit ratings, which resulted in increased opportunities in several keybusinesses. Securities gains in 1992 were $53 million compared with $110 millionin 1991. The gains recorded in both years principally resulted from certainactions taken by the Corporation in managing its interest rate sensitivity andenhancing its securities portfolio. Other revenue for 1992 was $190 million compared with $247 million in1991. The decrease from 1991 was principally due to lower revenue in connectionwith the Corporation's residential mortgage warehouse operations, theaforementioned reclassification of certain fees from other revenue to fees forother banking services and higher gains recorded in 1991 on the disposition ofnonstrategic corporate assets.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense was $4,930 million in 1992, compared with $5,307 million in1991. The results for 1992 included a one-time charge of $41 million related tocosts incurred in combining the Corporation's employee benefit plans and a $30million charge for London occupancy-related expenses associated with theCorporation's Canary Wharf lease arrangements. The 1991 results included a $625million restructuring charge in connection with the merger with MHC and an $18million reduction of expense related to an insurance settlement. Excluding theimpact of the aforementioned items, noninterest expense in 1992 increased by$159 million, or 3.4%, from 1991. The 1992 full-year noninterest expenseincluded higher foreclosed property expense, incentive compensation costs(principally due to improved revenues from the Corporation's tradingbusinesses) and FDIC premiums, which collectively increased by $208 million.The remaining amount of noninterest expense declined from year-to-year,reflecting the impact of merger-related expense savings.B50  62 Salaries and employee benefit expenses in 1992 were $2,349 million,slightly lower than the $2,369 million recorded in 1991. The decline wasprimarily due to lower costs attributable to the reduction in staff fromattrition and layoffs subsequent to the merger announcement on July 15, 1991.Partially offsetting this reduction was approximately $63 million of higherincentive compensation costs due to improved revenues primarily from theCorporation's trading businesses. Occupancy and equipment expenses for 1992 were $882 million, a slightincrease from $878 million in 1991. Foreclosed property expense in 1992 was $283 million compared with$154 million in 1991. The $129 million year-to-year increase reflected higheroperating expenses associated with an increased level of foreclosed assets anda higher level of expenses incurred in connection with writedowns resultingfrom updated market valuations. For 1992, other expense was $1,416 million compared with $1,281million in 1991. Other expense comprises items such as professional fees,insurance, advertising and communications expense, and in 1992 and 1991included the aforementioned one-time charges.INCOME TAXESThe Corporation recorded income tax expense of $243 million in 1992, comparedwith $136 million in 1991. Included in the 1992 and 1991 income tax expense wasapproximately $278 million and $130 million, respectively, of Federal incometax benefits. The Corporation's 1991 income tax expense was reduced by $55million as a result of settlements with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") oftaxes from prior years. The Corporation's effective tax rate in 1992 was lower than thestatutory rate primarily due to the recognition of approximately $278 millionof Federal income tax benefits. For 1991, the $625 million restructuringcharge, the aforementioned $130 million Federal income tax benefit and the $55million reduction in tax expense were the most significant factors affectingthe Corporation's effective tax rate. Deferred tax benefits were reflected inthe financial statements in accordance with the recognition requirements ofStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96, "Accounting for IncomeTaxes".NONPERFORMING ASSETSThe Corporation's total nonperforming assets at December 31, 1992 were $6,092million, compared with $6,155 million at December 31, 1991. The decline fromthe prior year-end resulted from a $251 million decrease in assets acquired asloan satisfactions, partially offset by an $100 million increase in LDCnonperforming loans and an $88 million increase in non-LDC nonperforming loans. The non-LDC nonperforming assets decreased $163 million from the 1991year-end primarily due to $1.3 billion of payments received on nonperformingloans and the sale of assets acquired, $1.1 billion of charge-offs andwritedowns (excluding consumer loan charge-offs on a formula basis) and $0.6billion of loans returning to performing status, partially offset by $2.8billion of loans placed on nonperforming status during 1992. LDC nonperforming loans at December 31, 1992 were $1,348 million, anincrease of $100 million from the 1991 year-end. The increase in nonperformingLDC loans principally reflected the placement of loans to Yugoslavia onnonperforming status during 1992, partially offset by charge-offs and sales andswaps of LDC loans.CASH FLOWSThe following comments apply to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cashand due from banks increased $1.3 billion during 1992, as net cash provided byoperating activities exceeded the net cash used by investing and financingactivities. The net cash provided by operating activities reflected changes inoperating assets/liabilities and higher earnings adjusted for non-cash chargesand credits. Financing activities used $1.1 billion of net cash, mainly due todecreases in Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchaseagreements and other borrowed funds. The net cash used in investing activitieswas largely the result of cash outflows for the purchases of securities and thenet increase in loans, partially offset by cash inflows from sales andmaturities of securities and the decrease in loans due to sales andsecuritizations.

On December 31, 1991,Manufacturers Hanover Corporation ("MHC") was merged with and into theCorporation. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, as aresult, the Corporation's financial statements include the consolidatedaccounts of MHC. In addition, on June 19, 1992, Manufacturers Hanover TrustCompany ("MHT") was merged with and into Chemical Bank. The Corporation conducts domestic and international financial servicesbusinesses through various bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The principal banksubsidiaries of the Corporation are Chemical Bank, a New York State bank("Chemical Bank"), and Texas Commerce Bank National Association, a subsidiaryof Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. ("Texas Commerce"), a bank holding companyorganized under the laws of the State of Delaware. The accounting and financialreporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to generallyaccepted accounting principles and prevailing industry practices. The followingis a description of significant accounting policies.BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporationand its majority-owned subsidiaries, after eliminating intercompany balancesand transactions. Equity investments in less than majority-owned companies(20%-50% ownership interest) are generally accounted for in accordance with theequity method of accounting. The Corporation's pro-rata share of earnings(losses) of equity investments is included in other noninterest revenue. Securities and other property held in a fiduciary or agency capacityare not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet since these are not assetsor liabilities of the Corporation. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform tothe current presentation.STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSFor purposes of preparing the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, theCorporation defines cash and cash equivalents as those amounts included in thebalance sheet caption "cash and due from banks". Cash flows from loans anddeposits are reported on a net basis.TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETSTrading account assets include securities, refinancing country loans, moneymarket, credit and certain derivative instruments held for trading purposes.Obligations to deliver securities sold but not yet purchased are included inother borrowed funds. Trading account assets and liabilities are carried atfair value. Gains and losses on trading account assets and liabilities,including market value adjustments, are included in trading account and foreignexchange revenue.HELD-TO-MATURITY AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIESEffective December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt andEquity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). Securities that may be sold in response to orin anticipation of changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, orother factors, are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value.The unrealized gains and losses on these securities, along with any unrealizedgains and losses on related hedges, are reported net of applicable taxes in aseparate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 1992, securitiesavailable-for-sale were carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value(see Note Four). Securities that the Corporation has the positive intent andability to hold to maturity continue to be carried at amortized cost. Interest income on securities, including amortization of premiums andaccretion of discounts, is recognized using the interest method. TheCorporation anticipates prepayments of principal in the calculation of theeffective yield for collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backedsecurities. The specific identification method is used to determine realizedgains and losses on sales of securities, which are reported in securitiesgains.LOANSLoans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net ofunearned income and net deferred loan fees (deferred nonrefundableyield-related loan fees, net of related direct origination costs). Mortgageloans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.Loans meeting the accounting definition of a security are reported as loans butare valued consistent with SFAS 115. Interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basisapproximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan. Net deferredloan fees are amortized into interest income over the term of the loan. Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest hasceased. Loans, other than certain consumer loans discussed below, are placed onnonaccrual status immediately if, in the opinion of management, principal orinterest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the loanagreement, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and B57  69NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTScollateral, if any, is insufficient to cover principal and interest. Interestaccrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status isreversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of net deferredloan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Interestincome is recognized on nonaccrual loans only to the extent received in cash.However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the loanprincipal, cash receipts, whether designated as principal or interest, arethereafter applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. Loans are restoredto accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought currentand future payments are reasonably assured. Renegotiated loans are those for which concessions, such as thereduction of interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments, havebeen granted due to a deterioration in the borrower's financial condition.Interest on renegotiated loans is accrued at the renegotiated rates. Certainrenegotiated loan agreements call for additional interest to be paid on adeferred or contingent basis. Such interest is taken into income only ascollected. Consumer loans (exclusive of residential mortgage products which areaccounted for in accordance with the nonaccrual loan policy discussed above)are generally charged to the allowance for losses upon reaching specifiedstages of delinquency. Accrued interest is reversed against interest incomewhen such consumer loans are charged off.ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSESThe allowance for losses is based on periodic reviews and analysis of theportfolio, which comprises primarily loans and other financial instruments,including commitments to extend credit, guarantees, letters of credit, andderivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The analysis includes considerationof such factors as the risk rating of individual credits, the size anddiversity of the portfolio (particularly in terms of industry and geography),economic and political conditions, prior loss experience and results ofperiodic credit reviews of the portfolio. The allowance for losses is increasedby charges against income and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries, andlosses on sales and swaps of loans to countries engaged in debt rescheduling.PREMISES AND EQUIPMENTPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at costless accumulated depreciation and amortization. Capital leases are included inpremises and equipment at the capitalized amount less accumulated amortization.Depreciation and amortization of premises are included in occupancy expensewhile depreciation of equipment is included in equipment expense. Depreciationand amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful life of the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements, over theestimated useful life of the related asset or the lease term, whichever isshorter.ASSETS ACQUIRED AS LOAN SATISFACTIONSAssets acquired in full or partial satisfaction of debt, either formally orthrough in-substance foreclosure, are reported at the lower of cost or fairvalue less estimated costs to sell. These are primarily real estate assets.Writedowns of such assets subsequent to six months from the date of acquisitionare included in foreclosed property expense. Operating expenses, net of relatedrevenue, and gains and losses on sales of such assets are reported net inforeclosed property expense.INTANGIBLESGoodwill and other acquisition intangibles are amortized over the estimatedperiods to be benefited, the majority of which are being amortized over periodsnot exceeding 25 years.OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS USED IN TRADING ACTIVITIESThe Corporation deals in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commoditycontracts to generate trading revenues. Such contracts include futures,forwards, swaps and options. Contracts used in trading activities are adjustedto fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading positionsare recognized in trading account and foreign exchange revenue. A portion ofthe market valuation relating to certain contracts is deferred and accreted toincome over the life of the contracts to match ongoing servicing costs andcredit risks, as appropriate.OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS USED INASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIESAs part of its asset/liability management activities, the Corporation may enterinto interest rate futures, forwards, swaps and options contracts. Gains andlosses realized on futures and forward contracts are deferred and amortizedover the terms of the related assets or liabilities and are included asadjustments to interest income or interest expense. Settlements on interestrate swaps and options contracts are recognized over the lives of theagreements as adjustments to interest income or interest expense. Interest rate contracts used in connection with the securitiesportfolio that is designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair valuewith gains and losses, net of applicable tax, reported in a separate componentof stockholders' equity, consistent with the reporting of unrealized gains andlosses on such securities.FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S.dollars using prevailing rates of exchange. Gains and losses on foreigncurrency translation from operations for which the functional currency is otherthan the U.S.B58  70dollar, together with related hedges and tax effects, are reported instockholders' equity. For foreign operations for which the U.S. dollar is thefunctional currency, translation gains and losses, including the relatedhedges, are included in trading account and foreign exchange revenue.CORPORATE FINANCE AND SYNDICATION FEESCorporate finance and syndication fees primarily include fees received formanaging and syndicating loan arrangements; providing investment banking andfinancial advisory services in connection with leveraged buyouts,recapitalizations, and mergers and acquisitions; underwriting debt securities;and arranging private placements. Syndication fees are recognized upon receiptwhen certain yield tests are satisfied. Corporate finance and underwriting feesare generally recognized when all services to which they relate have beenprovided.FEES FOR OTHER BANKING SERVICESFees received in connection with loan commitments, standby letters of credit,related administrative services performed and other fees are generallyrecognized over the period the related service is provided.INCOME TAXESEffective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"). UnderSFAS 109, the deferred tax liability (asset) is determined based on enacted taxrates which will be in effect when the underlying items of income and expenseare expected to be reported to the taxing authorities. Annual deferred taxexpense (benefit) is equal to the change in the deferred tax liability (asset)account from the beginning to the end of the year. A current tax liability orasset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable for thecurrent year. During 1992 and 1991, the Corporation followed Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS96"). See Note Sixteen for further discussion.NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARENet income per common share is computed by dividing net income, after deductingpreferred stock dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares andcommon stock equivalents outstanding during the period. On December 31, 1991, MHC merged with and into the Corporation.Pursuant to the merger, each share of common stock of MHC was converted into1.14 shares of common stock of the Corporation, or 91,238,025 common shares,and each share of preferred stock of MHC outstanding immediately prior to themerger was converted into one share of newly created preferred stock of theCorporation having terms similar to those of such MHC preferred stock. Commonshares and common stock equivalents outstanding for 1991 is based on thecombined weighted average number of shares of the Corporation's common stockand MHC's common stock outstanding during the period as adjusted to reflect theconversion of the MHC 97/8% Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock into sharesof MHC common stock prior to the merger and the conversion of each share of MHCcommon stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger into 1.14 shares ofthe Corporation's common stock as a result of the merger. For 1991 (due to the existence during such period of the Corporation'sClass B Common Stock), the earnings per share using the if-converted basis was$0.11 and using the two-class basis was $0.06. Other common stock equivalents such as stock options are not includedin the calculation since their dilutive effect is immaterial.NOTE TWOACQUISITIONSIn February 1993, the Corporation, through its Texas Commerce subsidiary,acquired $3.8 billion in assets and assumed $3.4 billion in deposit liabilitiesof four banks (the "First City Banks") of the former First City Bancorporationof Texas, Inc. ("First City") from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(the "FDIC") in a federally-assisted transaction. The First City Banks wereprimarily engaged in providing commercial banking services in Texas. Thepremium paid to the FDIC was $333 million. In September 1993, the Corporation, through Texas Commerce BankNational Association, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of Texas Commerce,acquired Ameritrust Texas Corporation ("Ameritrust"), a corporation engaged inthe delivery of personal, corporate and institutional trust and investmentservices. The purchase price included a premium of $130 million. These acquisitions were recorded using the purchase method ofaccounting. Under this method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated tothe respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimatedfair values. Intangibles related to the Ameritrust acquisition are beingamortized over a 10-year period. Deposit premiums and other intangibles relatedto the First City acquisition are being amortized over the estimated periods ofbenefit. Goodwill related to both acquisitions is being amortized over 25years. B59  71NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE THREETRADING ACCOUNT ASSETSTrading account assets at December 31, 1993 and 1992, which are valued at fairvalue, are presented in the following table.(a) Primarily includes corporate debt and eurodollar bonds.NOTE FOURSECURITIESOn December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS 115, which addresses theaccounting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinablefair values and for investments in all debt securities. Such securities areclassified in three categories and accounted for as follows: debt securitiesthat the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturityare classified as held-to-maturity and are measured at amortized cost; debt andequity securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling in thenear term are classified as trading securities and are measured at fair value,with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; debt and equitysecurities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading securities aredeemed available-for-sale and are measured at fair value, with unrealized gainsand losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component ofstockholders' equity. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 115, securities deemedavailable-for-sale were carried at the lower of aggregate amortized cost ormarket value. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 115, debt and equity securities inthe amount of $15,444 million that were previously measured at amortized costor at the lower of aggregate amortized cost or market are measured at fairvalue.HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIESThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of held-to-maturity securities wereas follows for the dates indicated:(a) The Corporation's portfolio of securities generally consists ofinvestment-grade securities. The fair value of actively-traded securities isdetermined by the secondary market, while the fair value fornon-actively-traded securities is based on independent broker quotations.(b) Collateralized mortgage obligations of private issuers generally haveunderlying collateral consisting of obligations of U.S. Government and Federalagencies and corporations.B60  72AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIESThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities atDecember 31, 1993 and 1992 were as follows:(a) The Corporation's portfolio of securities generally consists ofinvestment-grade securities. The fair value of actively-traded securities isdetermined by the secondary market, while the fair value fornon-actively-traded securities is based on independent broker quotations.(b) Collateralized mortgage obligations of private issuers generally haveunderlying collateral consisting of obligations of U.S. Government and Federalagencies and corporations. Cash proceeds from the sales of held-to-maturity securities during1993, 1992 and 1991 were $152 million, $3,736 million, and $8,238 million,respectively. Cash proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securitiesduring 1993 and 1992 were $5,352 million and $684 million, respectively. Netgains from available-for-sale securities sold in 1993 amounted to $139 million(gross gains of $178 million and gross losses of $39 million). Gross gains fromheld-to-maturity securities sold amounted to $3 million in 1993. Net gains fromsecurities sold in 1992 and 1991 were $53 million (gross gains of $140 millionand gross losses of $87 million) and $110 million (gross gains of $198 millionand gross losses of $88 million), respectively. The amortized cost, estimated fair value and average yield ofsecurities at December 31, 1993 by contractual maturity were as follows:(a) The average yield is based on effective rates on book balances at the endof the year. Yields are derived by dividing interest income, adjusted foramortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, by total amortized cost.(b) Securities with no stated maturity are included with securities with aremaining maturity of ten years or more. Substantially all of the Corporation'smortgage-backed securities are due in ten years or more based on contractualmaturity. The weighted-average maturity of mortgage-backed securities, whichreflects anticipated future prepayments based on a consensus of dealers in themarket, is approximately 5 years. B61  73NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE FIVELOANSThe composition of the loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was asfollows:(a) LDC denotes activity related to loans to countries engaged in debtrescheduling. As discussed in Note Four, the Corporation adopted SFAS 115 effectiveDecember 31, 1993. Certain loans that meet the accounting definition of asecurity are classified as loans and are measured pursuant to SFAS 115. Bondsthat have been issued by foreign governments (such as Mexico and Venezuela) tofinancial institutions, including the Corporation, as part of a debtrenegotiation are subject to the provisions of SFAS 115. Such loans areclassified as loans to foreign governments or as LDC loans. At December 31,1993, $3,783 million of loans, primarily renegotiated loans, were measuredunder SFAS 115, including $1,962 million that are classified asheld-to-maturity and that are carried at amortized cost. Pre-tax grossunrealized gains and gross unrealized losses related to these held-to-maturityloans totaled $13 million and $362 million, respectively, at December 31, 1993.Loans that were previously recorded at amortized cost and that were designatedas available-for-sale at December 31, 1993 are carried at fair value in theamount of $1,821 million. Pre-tax gross unrealized gains and gross unrealizedlosses on these loans totaled $86 million and $122 million, respectively, andare reported net of taxes in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Thefair value of loans designated as available-for-sale was calculated afterconsideration of the allowance for losses that would be available to covercredit losses. Substantially all foreign government and LDC loans that meet theaccounting definition of a security mature in over 10 years.RENEGOTIATED LOANSIn 1992, the Corporation exchanged $375 million of its medium- and long-termloans to the Philippines for an equal amount of uncollateralized 151/2-yearinterest rate reduction bonds with stated interest rates of 4% for years onethrough two, 5% for years three through five, 6% for year six, and LIBOR plus13/16% for each year thereafter. In 1991, the Corporation exchanged $135 million of its Uruguayanmedium- and long-term loans for an equal amount of 30-year interest ratereduction bonds, which have been collateralized by zero-coupon U.S. Treasuryobligations and carry a fixed rate of 6.75%. In accordance with the Mexican debt restructuring agreement of 1990,the Corporation exchanged approximately $2,527 million of Mexican medium- andlong-term loans for $663 million of 30-year principal reduction bonds, $1,515million of 30-year interest rate reduction bonds and a $7 million contributionof new money. Principal on the bonds is collateralized by zero-coupon U.S.Treasury obligations. Principal reduction bonds carry a floating rate ofinterest of LIBOR plus 13/16%. Interest rate reduction bonds carry a fixed rateof 6.25%. In accordance with the Republic of Venezuela 1990 Financing Plan, theCorporation exchanged approximately $605 million of Venezuelan medium- andlong-term loans for an equal amountB62  74of 30-year interest rate reduction bonds, which have been collateralized byzero-coupon U.S. Treasury obligations and carry a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. In addition, under the new money option of the Venezuelan 1990Financing Plan, the Corporation purchased $194 million of new money bonds andthen converted $968 million of existing outstandings into debt conversionbonds. Debt conversion bonds have a 17-year maturity and bear interest at arate of LIBOR plus 7/8%. New money bonds have a 15-year maturity, and bearinterest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 7/8% to LIBOR plus 1%. Aside from renegotiated loans to the Philippines, Uruguay, Mexico, andVenezuela, the Corporation's remaining renegotiated loans at December 31, 1993and 1992 were not significant.NOTE SIXALLOWANCE FOR LOSSESThe table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for losses during 1993,1992 and 1991.(a) Includes $55 million related to the decision to accelerate the dispositionof certain nonperforming residential mortgages.(b) Related to the First City Banks acquisition.(c) Includes $895 million of net charge-offs and $7 million of losses on salesand swaps related to Brazilian loans. During each of 1993 and 1992, the Corporation transferred $200 millionof the allowance for losses allocated to the LDC portfolio to the non-LDCportion of the allowance. The reallocations reflect the Corporation's ongoinganalysis and evaluation of its LDC loan portfolio, including the finalizationof the Argentine financing program and progress in debt negotiations withBrazil. In addition, during 1993, the Corporation specifically allocated aportion of the LDC allowance to Brazilian outstandings as a result of theCorporation's evaluation of its refinancing country portfolio and inconsideration of recent recommendations of the Interagency Country ExposureReview Committee. The LDC allowance allocated to Brazil was $82 million atDecember 31, 1993. B63  75NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE SEVENNONPERFORMING ASSETSThe Corporation's nonperforming assets were as follows: Certain assets ("shared loss assets") acquired from First City aresubject to the loss-sharing provisions of the Purchase and AssumptionAgreements between the FDIC and Texas Commerce relating to the First City Banksbased in Houston and Dallas/Ft. Worth. These agreements provide that, for aperiod of five years following the acquisition, the FDIC will absorb 80% offuture losses arising from such shared loss assets up to $61 million from theHouston bank and $21 million from the Dallas/Ft. Worth bank and 95% of lossesin excess of such respective amounts. Shared loss assets are certain specifiedcommercial and real estate loans acquired by Texas Commerce at those two banks.At December 31, 1993, nonperforming shared loss assets were $98 million. Suchassets are not included in the amount of nonperforming assets in the tableabove. The following table presents the amount of interest income recorded bythe Corporation on its nonaccrual and renegotiated loans (including LDC loans)and the amount of interest income on the carrying value of such loans thatwould have been recorded if these loans had been current in accordance withtheir original terms (interest at original rates).IMPACT OF NONPERFORMING LOANS ON INTEREST INCOMENOTE EIGHTSHORT-TERM AND OTHER BORROWINGS(a) Average balances were computed using daily balances.Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements aregenerally issued on an overnight or demand basis. Commercial paper isgenerally issued in amounts not less than $100,000 and with maturities of 270days or less. Other borrowings consist of demand notes and various otherborrowings in domestic and foreign offices that generally have maturities ofless than one year. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had unused lines of creditavailable for general corporate purposes, including the payment of commercialpaper borrowings, amounting to $750 million.B64  76NOTE NINE(a) Includes subordinated notes in aggregate principal amounts of $3.8 billionand $3.1 billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The accompanying table is a summary of long-term debt (net ofunamortized original issue debt discount, where applicable) displayed byremaining maturity at December 31, 1993. The distribution by remaining maturityis based on contractual maturity or the earliest date on which the debt isredeemable at the option of the holder. Fixed-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 1993 matures at variousdates through 2008 at interest rates ranging from 3.26% to 11.83%. Theconsolidated weighted-average interest rates on fixed-rate debt at December 31,1993 and 1992 were 8.03% and 8.70%, respectively. Variable-rate debtoutstanding, with interest rates ranging from 3.32% to 6.67% at December 31,1993, matures at various dates through 2011. The consolidated weighted-averageinterest rates on variable-rate debt at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were 3.94%and 4.60%, respectively. Included in long-term debt are equity commitment notes and equitycontract notes totalling $923 million and $1,826 million at December 31, 1993and 1992, respectively. Equity commitment notes require that the Corporation issue, prior totheir maturity, shares of common stock or perpetual preferred stock or othersecurities of the Corporation (collectively, "Capital Securities") approved bythe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal ReserveBoard") equal to 100% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes. Equity contract notes require the Corporation to exchange the notes atmaturity for Capital Securities with a market value equal to the principalamount of the notes or, at the Corporation's option, to pay the principal ofthe notes from amounts representing designated proceeds from the sale ofCapital Securities. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had designated proceeds from thesale of Capital Securities in an amount sufficient to satisfy fully thededication requirements of its equity commitment and equity contract notes. The Corporation has guaranteed several long-term debt issues of itssubsidiaries. Such guaranteed debt totaled $300 million and $291 million atDecember 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. At December 31, 1993, long-term debt aggregating $640 million wasredeemable at the option of the Corporation, in whole or in part, prior tomaturity, based on the terms specified in the respective notes. The Corporation's aggregate amounts of maturities and sinking fundrequirements for the five years subsequent to December 31, 1993 are $1,664million in 1994, $1,167 million in 1995, $701 million in 1996, $679 million in1997 and $605 million in 1998.NOTE TENPREFERRED STOCKAt December 31, 1993, the Corporation was authorized to issue 200 millionshares of preferred stock, in one or more series, with a par value of $1 pershare. During 1993, the Corporation redeemed all 3.87 million outstandingshares of its Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E, at aredemption price of $51.50 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends; allfour million outstanding shares of its Adjustable Rate Cumulative PreferredStock, Series F, at a redemption price of $50.00 per share plus accrued butunpaid dividends; and all two million outstanding shares of its 103/4%Cumulative Preferred Stock, at a redemption price of $105.375 per share plusaccrued but unpaid dividends. Two issues of preferred stock totaling $400million were issued during 1993. At December 31, 1993, four million shares ofpreferred stock designated as Junior Participating Preferred Stock werereserved for issuance under the Corporation's Shareholders' Rights Plan (seeNote Twentythree). During 1992, the Corporation redeemed all 3.83 million outstandingshares of its Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred B65  77NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSStock, Series A, all 2 million outstandings shares of its Adjustable RateCumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, and also retired all 170,000 shares ofpreferred stock that were held in treasury. The following is a summary of the Corporation's preferred stocksoutstanding at December 31, 1993:(a) Shares may be redeemed (at option of the Corporation) in whole or in partthrough May 1, 1997 at $12.36 per share and at $12.00 per share thereafter.(b) Shares may be redeemed (at option of the Corporation) in whole or in parton or after June 30, 2000 at $25.00 per share.(c) Shares may be redeemed (at option of the Corporation) from May 1, 1995 at$53.00 per share, and at decreasing prices thereafter declining to $50.00 pershare on May 1, 2001 and thereafter. The shares are convertible at any time atthe option of the holder into shares of common stock at a conversion priceequal to $26.20, subject to adjustments as set forth in the terms of thepreferred stock.(d) Shares were issued in 1992 and may be redeemed (at the option of theCorporation) from June 1, 1997 at $25.00 per share.(e) Shares were issued in 1992 and may be redeemed (at the option of theCorporation) from October 1, 1997 at $100 per share. Such shares arerepresented by 8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing .25 of a share.(f) Shares were issued in 1993 and may be redeemed (at the option of theCorporation) from April 1, 1998 at $100 per share. Such shares are representedby 8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing .25 of a share.(g) Shares were issued in 1993 and may be redeemed (at the option of theCorporation) from June 1, 1998 at $100 per share. Such shares are representedby 8,000,000 depositary shares, each representing .25 of a share. The dividend rate on the Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock,Series C, is adjusted quarterly based on a formula that considers the interestrates of selected short- and long-term U.S. Treasury securities prevailing atthe time the rate is set. All the preferred stocks outstanding have preferenceover the Corporation's common stock with respect to the payment of dividendsand the distribution of assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution ofthe Corporation.NOTE ELEVENCOMMON STOCKAt December 31, 1993, the Corporation was authorized to issue 400 millionshares of common stock, $1 par value per share. At December 31, the number ofshares of common stock issued and outstanding were as follows: As of December 31, 1993, approximately 18,472,629 shares of commonstock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive and stockpurchase plans and under the Corporation's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Inaddition, as of such date, the Corporation had reserved 7,700,000 shares ofcommon stock for issuance upon the conversion of its 10% Convertible PreferredStock. Under the Corporation's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, stockholders mayreinvest all or part of their quarterly dividends in shares of common stock. Common stock issued during 1993, 1992 and 1991 was as follows:B66  78NOTE TWELVEFEES FOR OTHER BANKING SERVICES AND OTHER REVENUEDetails of fees for other banking services were as follows: In 1992, the Corporation reclassified the amortization of purchasedmortgage servicing rights from other expenses to fees for other bankingservices. Such amounts are recorded as reductions to mortgage servicing fees.Prior period amounts have been restated to conform with the 1992 presentation.Other Revenue: Included in other revenue was venture capital income of $301million in 1993, compared with $100 million in 1992 and $66 million in 1991.Also included in other revenue in 1993 were $179 million of gains related tothe sale of Argentine past-due interest bonds and $152 million related to thesale of Brazilian interest-due-and-unpaid bonds.NOTE THIRTEENPOSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSPension Plans: The Corporation amended its noncontributory pension plan as ofJanuary 1, 1993 (the "noncontributory plan"). It covers substantially alldomestic employees and provides for defined benefits pursuant to a cash balancefeature and a final-average-pay feature. Contributions will be made to thenoncontributory plan within the range of levels permitted under applicable law.Through December 31, 1992, employees of the Corporation and the former MHC hadseparate noncontributory pension plans that covered substantially all domesticemployees who satisfied minimum age and length-of-service requirements (the"prior domestic plans"). Both prior domestic plans provided a defined benefitthat was determined based on years of service and either annual compensationduring employment or a percentage of qualifying compensation during final yearsof employment. Certain benefits accrued under such prior domestic plans areadded to benefits accrued after January 1, 1993 under the noncontributory plan. The Corporation also maintains a number of pension plans in foreignjurisdictions covering the employees of certain foreign operations. A newdefined contribution plan was adopted in 1992 for United Kingdom employees.Contributions are made to the foreign plans in accordance with local plan andlegal requirements. The accompanying tables present the aggregate funded status and thenet asset amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and thecomponents of net pension expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement ofIncome for those plans in effect at the respective dates that had assets inexcess of benefit obligations. At December 31, 1993, the assumptions used todetermine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligation included: a7.5% discount rate and a 5% annual rate of increase in future compensation. For1993 expense, an 8.75% discount rate, a 6% annual rate of increase in futurecompensation and a 9.5% annual long-term rate of return on plan assets wereassumed. The 1992 and 1991 amounts in the accompanying tables reflect thefollowing weighted-average assumptions: discount rates of 8.75% in 1992 and8.5% to 9.5% in 1991; annual rates of increase in future compensation of 6% inboth 1992 and 1991; and annual long-term rates of return on plan assets of 9.5%in 1992, and 9% to 10% in 1991. In 1993, the changes in the benefits design in connection with thenoncontributory pension plan resulted in significantly higher net periodicpension expense. The increase in the unrecognized net loss at December 31, 1993resulted primarily from the change in assumptions. Amortization of the loss inexcess of a 10% corridor will result in an increase in expense in 1994 andsubsequent years. In addition, the assumed annual long-term rate of return onplan assets will be lowered to 8.5% in 1994. B67  79NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In 1992, the Corporation recognized a one-time, pre-tax charge of $41million relating to costs incurred in combining the Corporation's employeebenefit plans. The $41 million included: $17 million of special-windowtermination benefits, net of settlement and curtailment gains, that related tothe prior domestic plans; and a $24 million cost for restructuring planscovering United Kingdom employees. The Corporation also has several defined benefit plans that it haselected not to prefund fully based on plan and legal requirements. At each ofDecember 31, 1993 and 1992, the Corporation's accrued liability related tothose plans totaled $43 million and $37 million, respectively, and expense was$8 million in both 1993 and 1992.Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions: The Corporation providespostretirement health care and life insurance benefits to substantially alldomestic employees hired prior to April 15, 1992 who meet certain age andlength-of-service requirements at retirement. The amount of benefits providedvaries with length of service and date of hire. The Corporation has notprefunded these benefits. Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted SFAS No. 106,"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS106"). SFAS 106 requires recognition, during the years of the employees' activeservice, of the employer's expected cost and obligation of providingpostretirement health care and other postretirement benefits other thanpensions to employees and eligible dependents. The Corporation elected to expense the entire unrecognized accumulatedobligation as of the date of adoption of SFAS 106 via a one-time pre-tax chargeof $415 million. During 1993, the Corporation accrued $38 million of periodicexpense, which was comprised of $35 million of interest and $3 million relatedto the cost of benefits earned during the year. Of the $38 million, $31 millionrelated to current retirees. Through December 31, 1992, the Corporationrecognized the costs of providing postretirement benefits on a cash basis. In1992, the Corporation recognized cash-basis costs of $22 million. At December 31, 1993, the Corporation's accumulated benefit obligationtotaled $481 million, of which $419 million related to current retirees, withthe remainder attributable to active employees. After consideration of anunrecognized net loss of $68 million, the accrued obligation included inaccounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet atDecember 31, 1993 totaled $413 million. The unrecognized net loss in excess ofa 10% corridor will be amortized commencing in 1994; however, the increase inexpense resulting from such amortization will be offset by lower interest cost.As of December 31, 1993, a 7.5% discount rate was used to determine theactuarial present value of the benefit obligation. A 9% rate was used tocompute the 1993 interest expense. The assumed medical benefits cost trend ratewas 15% for 1993, declining by 1% per year to a floor of 6%. The effect of a 1%increase in the assumed medical-benefits cost trend rate would be to increasethe December 31, 1993 accumulated obligation and related periodic expense byapproximately 10%.NOTE FOURTEENEMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANSIn 1992, the Corporation adopted a new, consolidated stock incentive plan (the"current plan"). The current plan provides for stock-based awards, includingstock options and restricted stock. The former plans of the Corporation and MHCgenerally provided for similar types of awards. The following discussionapplies to outstanding awards issued under all of the Corporation's current andformer employee stock incentive plans (the "plans"). At each of December 31, 1993 and 1992, 223,365 and 587,653 shares,respectively, of the Corporation's common stock were reserved for issuance andavailable for future awards under the current plan. Stock options are issued at prices at least equal to the market valueof the Corporation's common stock on the grant date. Under generally acceptedaccounting principles, no expense is currently required to be recognized inconjunction with options granted or exercised; amounts received upon theexercise of options are recorded as common stock and capital surplus. Optionsgenerally expire ten years after the grant date. Options cannot be exerciseduntil one year after the grant date and generally become exercisable overvarious periods as determined in the grant. At December 31, 1993, stock optionscovering 4,616,083 shares of the Corporation's common stock were exercisableunder the plans.B68  80 Restricted stock is issued and valued as of the grant date, and thevalue is amortized to compensation expense over the restriction period. During1993 and 1992, 48,500 and 28,500 shares, respectively, of restricted stock wereissued under the current plan. The following table presents a summary of the aggregate optionstransactions which occurred under all of the Corporation's plans during 1993and 1992.NOTE FIFTEENRESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXPENSEIn 1993, the Corporation completed an assessment of costs associated with themerger of the Corporation and MHC and, as a result, included in noninterestexpense a charge of $115 million. The charge is related principally to changesin the Corporation's facilities plans since the merger announcement and revisedestimates of occupancy-related costs associated with headquarters and branchconsolidations. At December 31, 1993, the merger reserve balance wasapproximately $80 million. The Corporation's Texas Commerce subsidiary incurred a restructuringcharge of $43 million in 1993 in connection with the acquisition of assets andassumption of liabilities of the First City Banks from the FDIC. Therestructuring charge is being utilized for expenses associated with cost-savingactions arising from the acquisition. These actions include the consolidationof operations and the elimination of redundant expenses. In 1991, in connection with the merger with MHC, the Corporationincurred a pre-tax restructuring charge of $625 million, principally forexpenses associated with staff reductions and office consolidations.Other Expense: Included in other expense were FDIC assessments of $175 millionin 1993, compared with $159 million in 1992 and $143 million in 1991.Professional services expense in 1993 was $193 million compared with $196million in 1992 and $213 million in 1991, and marketing expense in 1993 was$187 million compared with $111 million in 1992 and $100 million in 1991.NOTE SIXTEENINCOME TAXESThe Corporation adopted SFAS 109 as of January 1, 1993 and, after taking intoaccount the additional tax benefits associated with the adoption of SFAS 106(see Note Thirteen), the Corporation recognized a favorable cumulative effecton income tax expense of $450 million (or $1.81 per common share). Prior-years'financial statements have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS109. Prior to 1993, the Corporation followed Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards No. 96, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 96"). Theprimary difference between SFAS 109 and SFAS 96 is that SFAS 96 precluded therecognition of deferred tax assets the realization of which was dependent ontaxable earnings of future years. SFAS 109 requires recognition of suchdeferred tax assets except where, in management's judgement, the realization ofsuch tax benefits appears unlikely. The cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of SFAS 109 was lessthan the unrecognized benefits available at December 31, 1992 because of thetiming of anticipated future income, tax law limitations on the utilization oftax-attribute carryovers, and the recognition of losses at the two predecessorinstitutions in recent years. A valuation reserve was established as of January 1, 1993, inaccordance with the requirements of SFAS 109, for tax benefits available to theCorporation but for which realization was in doubt. The Corporation's valuationreserve for Federal taxes of $452 million upon adoption of SFAS 109, asrestated for the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA"), wasreevaluated and reduced by $331 million during 1993 due to the strength of theCorporation's earnings. The remaining Federal valuation reserve of $121 millionrelates to tax benefits B69  81NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSwhich are subject to tax law limitations on realization. At this time, the Corporation believes that realization of these benefits is sufficiently indoubt to preclude recognition in accordance with the criteria of SFAS 109. Additionally, a valuation reserve approximating $148 million wasestablished as of January 1, 1993 against all New York State and City deferredtax assets. Because of the lack of any loss carryover provision under New Yorkstatutes, the Corporation is uncertain at this time whether these tax benefitscan be realized. The Corporation has recorded deferred New York State and Citytax liabilities of approximately $202 million, after valuation reserve, as ofDecember 31, 1993. Foreign deferred taxes are not material. On August 10, 1993, President Clinton signed OBRA, which increased thecorporate Federal tax rate from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993. Theimpact on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in adecrease in the Corporation's tax expense of approximately $8 million. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) results from differences betweenamounts of assets and liabilities as measured for income tax return andfinancial reporting purposes. The significant components of Federal deferredtax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1993 are reflected in thefollowing table. The components of income tax expense included in the ConsolidatedStatement of Income were as follows: Not reflected in the accompanying table are the tax effects of foreigncurrency translation adjustments related to the hedging of foreign netinvestments. Because the functional currency used in the hedging of foreigninvestments is not the U.S. dollar, the tax effects are recorded directly instockholders' equity and are not included in consolidated income. These taxeffects amounted to a decrease of $2 million in 1993 and $4 million in 1992 andan increase of $4 million in 1991. Additionally, the tax effects of SFAS 115 onunrealized gains and losses, with respect to available-for-sale securities, arerecorded directly in stockholders' equity and in 1993 amounted to a decrease of$145 million. The tax expense applicable to securities gains and losses for theyears 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $62 million, $17 million and $31 million,respectively. A reconciliation of the income tax expense computed at the applicablestatutory U.S. income tax rate to the actual income tax expense for the pastthree years is shown in the following table.B70  82 The following table presents the domestic and foreign components ofincome before income taxes for the past three years.(a) For purposes of this disclosure, foreign income is defined by Securitiesand Exchange Commission regulations as income generated from operations locatedoutside the United States.NOTE SEVENTEENRESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND INTERCOMPANY FUNDS TRANSFERSFederal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintaincash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of reservebalances deposited by the Corporation with various Federal Reserve Banks was $1billion during both 1993 and 1992. Restrictions imposed by Federal law prohibit the Corporation andcertain other affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless theloans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans to the Corporationor to each of certain other affiliates generally are limited to 10% of thebanking subsidiary's capital and surplus; the aggregate amount of all suchloans is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary's capital and surplus. The principal sources of the Corporation's income are dividends andinterest from Chemical Bank and the other banking and non-banking subsidiariesof the Corporation. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividendsby the subsidiaries of the Corporation that are state member banks of theFederal Reserve System (a "state member bank") or are national banks. Undersuch limitations, dividend payments by such banks are limited to the lesser of(i) the amount of "undivided profits then on hand" (as defined) less the amountof "bad debts" (as defined) in excess of the allowance for losses and (ii)absent regulatory approval, an amount not in excess of "net profits" (asdefined) for the current year plus "retained net profits" (as defined) for thepreceding two years. Non-bank subsidiaries of the Corporation are not subjectto such limitations. At December 31, 1993, in accordance with the foregoing restrictions,the Corporation's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of theirrelevant banking regulators, pay dividends of approximately $1.7 billion totheir respective bank holding companies, plus an additional amount equal totheir net profits from January 1, 1994 through the date of any such dividendpayment. In addition to dividend restrictions, the Federal Reserve Board, theOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have authority under theFinancial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment ofdividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including theCorporation and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if,in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute anunsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bankingorganization.NOTE EIGHTEENFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKDerivatives and Foreign Exchange Products: In the normal course of itsbusiness, the Corporation utilizes various financial instruments to meet thefinancing needs of its customers, to generate revenues through its tradingactivities, and to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and currencyrates. Derivatives and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varyingdegrees, credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the possibility that aloss may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according tothe terms of the contract. Market risk is the possibility that a change ininterest or currency rates will cause the value of a financial instrument todecrease or become more costly to settle. The Corporation controls the credit risk arising from derivative andforeign exchange transactions by using the same credit procedures when enteringinto such transactions as it does for traditional lending products. The creditapproval process involves first evaluating each counterparty'screditworthiness, then assessing the applicability of derivative instruments tothe risks the counterparty is attempting to manage and determining if there arespecific transaction characteristics which alter the risk profile. Ifcollateral is deemed necessary to reduce credit risk, the amount and nature ofthe collateral obtained is based B71  83NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSon management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies butmay include cash, investment securities, accounts receivable, inventory,property, plant and equipment, and real estate. The market risk associated with derivatives and foreign exchangeproducts, the prices of which are constantly fluctuating, is regulated byimposing strict limits as to the types, amounts and degree of risk that tradersmay undertake. These limits are approved by senior management, and the riskpositions of traders are reviewed on a daily basis to monitor compliance withthe limits. The notional principal of derivatives and foreign exchange products isthe amount upon which interest and other payments in a transaction are based.For derivative transactions, the notional principal typically does not changehands; it is simply a quantity that is used to calculate payments. Whilenotional principal is the most commonly used volume measure in the derivativesand foreign exchange markets, it is not a measure of credit exposure. TheCorporation believes that the true measure of credit exposure is thereplacement cost (the cost to replace the contract at current market ratesshould the counterparty default prior to the settlement date). This is alsoreferred to as the mark-to-market exposure amount. Overall counterparty credit risk assumed by the Corporation issubstantially reduced through master netting agreements. The Corporation entersinto master netting agreements which permit the Corporation to offset themark-to-market exposure for derivative or foreign exchange contracts with thesame counterparty. During 1993, the Corporation began to expand the number ofmaster netting agreements for all of its instruments executed with itscounterparties. Credit exposure not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at eachof December 31, 1993 and 1992 is summarized in the following table. The amountof mark-to-market exposure presented for 1993 takes into account the effects ofmaster netting agreements in effect at December 31, 1993. The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from such transactionshave been immaterial during 1993, 1992 and 1991. The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts ofinterest rates and foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 1993 and 1992.The table should be read in conjunction with the preceding narrative as well asthe descriptions of these products and their risks immediately following.(a) ALM: Asset/Liability Management.B72  84 The Corporation deals in interest-rate and foreign exchange contractsto generate fee income and trading revenues and also utilizes interest ratecontracts to manage its own asset/liability risk. Interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rateflows in a single currency are exchanged over a prescribed period. The notionalamount on which the interest payments are based is not exchanged. Most interestrate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest payments.Cross-currency interest rate swaps are contracts that involve the exchange ofboth interest and principal amounts in two different currencies. The risksinherent in interest rate and cross currency swap contracts are the potentialinability of a counterparty to meet the terms of each contract and the riskassociated with changes in the market values of the underlying interest rates.To reduce its exposure to market risk, the Corporation may enter intooffsetting positions. Interest rate options, which include caps and floors, are contractswhich transfer, modify, or reduce interest rate risk in exchange for thepayment of a premium when the contract is initiated. As a writer of interestrate caps, floors, and other options, the Corporation receives a premium inexchange for bearing the risk of unfavorable changes in interest rates. Foreigncurrency options are similar to interest rate option contracts, except thatthey are based on currencies instead of interest rates. To reduce its exposureto market risk related to writing or purchasing options the Corporation mayenter into offsetting positions. Forward rate agreements are contracts to exchange payments on acertain future date, based on a market change in interest rates from trade dateto contract maturity date. The maturity of these agreements is typically lessthan two years. To reduce its exposure to market risk, the Corporation mayenter into offsetting positions. Foreign exchange contracts are contracts for the future receipt ordelivery of foreign currency at previously agreed upon terms. The risksinherent in these contracts are the potential inability of a counterparty tomeet the terms of each contract and the risk associated with changes in themarket values of the underlying currencies. To reduce its exposure to marketrisk, the Corporation may enter into offsetting positions. Futures and forwards are contracts for the delayed delivery ofsecurities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees to deliver ona specified future date, a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield.The credit risk inherent in futures is the risk that the exchange may default.Futures contracts settle in cash daily and, therefore, there is minimal creditrisk to the Corporation. The credit risk inherent in forwards arises from thepotential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.Both futures and forwards are also subject to the risk of movements in interestrates or the value of the underlying securities or instruments. The Corporation enters into other contracts such as stock index optioncontracts and commodity contracts. Stock index option contracts are contractsto pay or receive cash flows from counterparties based upon the increase ordecrease in the underlying index. Commodity contracts include swaps, caps andfloors and are similar to interest rate contracts, except that they are basedon commodity indices instead of interest rates. The Corporation also enters into transactions involving "when-issuedsecurities". When-issued securities are commitments to purchase or sellsecurities authorized for issuance, but not yet actually issued. Accordingly,they are not recorded on the balance sheet until issued. At December 31, 1993and 1992, commitments to purchase were $2,194 million and $2,799 million,respectively, and commitments to sell were $1,790 million and $3,158 million,respectively.Credit-related financial instruments: In meeting the financing needs of itscustomers, the Corporation issues commitments to extend credit, standby andother letters of credit and guarantees, and also provides securities lendingservices. For these instruments, the contractual amount of the financialinstrument represents the maximum potential credit risk if the counterpartydoes not perform according to the terms of the contract. A large majority ofthese commitments expire without being drawn upon. As a result, totalcontractual amounts do not represent future credit exposure or liquidityrequirements. The following table summarizes the Corporation's maximum credit risk,which is represented by contract amounts relating to these financialinstruments at December 31, 1993 and 1992.(a) Excludes credit card commitments of $18 billion and $13 billion at December31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Unfunded commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to acustomer who has complied with predetermined contractual conditions.Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates. Standby letters of credit and guarantees are conditional commitmentsissued by the Corporation generally to guarantee the performance of a customerto a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as commercial paper, bondfinancing, construction and similar transactions. The credit risk involved inissuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved inextending loan facilities to customers and may be reduced by participations tothird parties. The Corporation holds collateral to support those standbyletters of credit and guarantees written for which collateral is deemednecessary. At December 31, 1993, 94% of the Corporation's standby letters ofcredit and guarantees written expire in less than five years. B73  85NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Customers' securities lent are customers' securities held by theCorporation which are lent to third parties. The Corporation obtainscollateral, with a market value exceeding 100% of the contract amount, for allsuch customers' securities lent, which is used to indemnify customers againstpossible losses resulting from third-party defaults.CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged insimilar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, orhave similar economic features that would cause their ability to meetcontractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economicconditions. Concentrations of credit risk indicate the relative sensitivity of theCorporation's performance to both positive and negative developments affectinga particular industry. Based on the nature of the banking business, managementdoes not believe that any of these concentrations are unusual. The accompanying table presents the Corporation's significantconcentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments. The Corporationhas procedures to monitor counterparty credit risk and to obtain collateralwhen deemed necessary. Accordingly, management believes that the total creditexposure shown below is not representative of the potential risk of lossinherent in the portfolio. Geographic concentrations are a factor most directly affecting thecredit risk of the real estate and LDC segments of the Corporation's loanportfolio. The Corporation's real estate portfolio is primarily concentrated inthe New York Metropolitan area and in Texas. Its LDC portfolio is concentratedin Latin America.NOTE NINETEENFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About FairValue of Financial Instruments" ("SFAS 107"), requires the Corporation todisclose fair value information about financial instruments for which it ispracticable to estimate the value, whether or not such financial instrumentsare recognized on the balance sheet. Fair value is the amount at which afinancial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction betweenwilling parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is bestevidenced by a quoted market price if one exists. Quoted market prices are not available for a significant portion ofthe Corporation's financial instruments. As a result, the fair values presentedare estimates derived using present value or other valuation techniques and maynot be indicative of the net realizable or liquidation value. In addition, thecalculation of estimated fair value is based on market conditions at a specificpoint in time and may not be reflective of current or future fair values. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments areexcluded from the scope of SFAS 107. Accordingly, the fair value disclosuresrequired by SFAS 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of theCorporation; for example, the values associated with the various ongoingbusinesses which the Corporation operates are excluded. The Corporation hasestimated the value related to the long-term relationships with its customersthrough its deposit base and its credit card accounts, commonly referred to ascore deposit intangibles and credit card relationships, respectively, as wellas the value of its portfolio of mortgage servicing rights and its owned andleased premises. In the aggregate, these items add significant value to theCorporation but their fair value is not disclosed in this Note. The following summary presents the methodologies and assumptions usedto estimate the fair value of the Corporation's financial instruments requiredto be valued pursuant to SFAS 107.B74  86FINANCIAL ASSETSAssets for Which Fair Value Approximates Book Value: The fair value of certainfinancial assets carried at cost, including cash and due from banks, depositswith banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resaleagreements, due from customers on acceptances, short-term receivables andaccrued interest receivable is considered to approximate their respective bookvalues due to their short-term nature and negligible credit losses. Inaddition, the Corporation carries trading account assets and derivatives usedin trading activities at fair value. See Note One for a description of thesefinancial instruments.Securities: Securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost at eachof December 31, 1993 and 1992. Securities available-for-sale and interest ratecontracts used in connection with such portfolio are carried at fair value atDecember 31, 1993. Such securities were carried at lower of aggregate amortizedcost or market value at December 31, 1992. The valuation methodologies forsecurities are discussed in Note Four.Loans: The fair value of the Corporation's non-LDC commercial loan portfoliowas estimated by assessing the two main risk components of the portfolio:credit and interest. The estimated cash flows were adjusted to reflect theinherent credit risk and then discounted, using rates appropriate for eachmaturity that incorporate the effects of interest rate changes. Generally, LDCloans were valued based on secondary market prices. For consumer installment loans and residential mortgages, for whichmarket rates for comparable loans are readily available, the fair value wasestimated by discounting cash flows, adjusted for prepayments. The discountrates used for consumer installment loans were current rates offered bycommercial banks and thrifts; for residential mortgages, secondary marketyields for comparable mortgage-backed securities, adjusted for risk were used.The fair value of credit card receivables was estimated by discounting expectednet cash flows. The discount rate used incorporated the effects of interestrate changes only, since the estimated cash flows were adjusted for creditrisk. The estimated fair value of net loans increased from 100% of carryingvalue at December 31, 1992 to 104% of carrying value at December 31, 1993primarily due to the positive effect of a $2.2 billion reduction innonperforming loans during 1993.Other: Included in other assets are equity investments, venture capitalinvestments and securities acquired as loan satisfactions. The fair value ofthese investments was determined on an individual basis. The valuationmethodologies included market values of publicly-traded securities, independentappraisals, and cash flow analyses.FINANCIAL LIABILITIESLiabilities for Which Fair Value Approximates Book Value: SFAS 107 requiresthat the fair value disclosed for deposit liabilities with no stated maturity(i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to thecarrying value. SFAS 107 does not allow for the recognition of the inherentfunding value of these instruments. The fair value of foreign deposits, federal funds purchased andsecurities sold under repurchase agreements, other borrowed funds, acceptancesoutstanding, short-term payables and accounts payable and accrued liabilitiesare considered to approximate their respective book values due to theirshort-term nature.Domestic Time Deposits: The fair value of time deposits was estimated bydiscounting cash flows based on contractual maturities at the average interestrates offered by commercial banks and thrifts.Long-Term Debt: The valuation of long-term debt takes into account severalfactors, including current market interest rates and the Corporation's creditrating. Quotes were gathered from various investment banking firms forindicative yields for the Corporation's securities over a range of maturities.Derivatives Used for Asset/Liability Management: The Corporation employsoff-balance sheet financial instruments to manage its asset/liability exposureto fluctuations in interest rates. These instruments are mostly used to manageoverall exposure as opposed to hedging specific on-balance sheet items. Theestimated fair value and carrying value of these instruments at December 31,1993 was $725 million and $300 million, respectively. The estimated fair valueand carrying value of these instruments at December 31, 1992 was $756 millionand $246 million, respectively. Interest rate contracts were valued at the netpresent value of expected cash flows based upon prevailing market rates.Unused Commitments and Letters of Credit: The Corporation has reviewed theunfunded portion of commitments to extend credit as well as standby and otherletters of credit, and has determined that the fair value of such financialinstruments is not material. The following table presents the financial assets and liabilitiesrequired to be valued for SFAS 107. B75  87NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(a) Estimated fair value in 1993 includes a decrease of approximately $2million representing estimated fair value amounts of interest rate contracts,used in connection with available-for-sale securities.(b) Estimated fair value in 1993 includes an increase of approximately $2 million representing estimated fair value amounts of interest rate contracts, used in connection with mortgages held-for-sale.(c) Estimated fair value in 1993 includes an increase of approximately $7 million representing estimated fair value amounts of interest rate contracts, used in connection with long-term debt.NOTE TWENTYCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESAt December 31, 1993, the Corporation and its subsidiaries were obligated undera number of noncancelable operating leases for premises and equipment usedprimarily for banking purposes. Certain leases contain rent escalation clausesfor real estate taxes and other operating expenses and renewal option clausescalling for increased rents. No lease agreement imposes any restrictions on theCorporation affecting its ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equityfinancing transactions or to enter into further lease agreements. Futureminimum rental payments required under operating leases with initial orremaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31,1993 were as follows: Total rental expense in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was as follows: At December 31, 1993 and 1992, assets amounting to $18 billion and $26billion, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for otherpurposes. The significant components of the $18 billion of assets pledged atDecember 31, 1993 to secure public deposits and for other purposes were asfollows: $4 billion were securities, $8 billion were loans, and the remaining$6 billion were primarily trading account assets. These amounts compare with$11 billion of securities, $8 billion of loans and $7 billion of tradingaccount assets pledged at December 31, 1992. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number oflegal proceedings. After reviewing with counsel all such actions andproceedings pending against or involving the Corporation and its subsidiaries,management does not expect the aggregate liability or loss, if any, resultingtherefrom to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financialcondition of the Corporation.B76  88NOTE TWENTYONEINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONSThe accompanying table presents total assets and income statement informationfor 1993, 1992 and 1991 pertaining to international and domestic operations ofthe Corporation by major geographic areas, based on the domicile of thecustomer. The Corporation defines international activities as businesstransactions that involve customers residing outside of the United States.However, a definitive separation of the Corporation's domestic and foreignbusinesses cannot be performed because many of the Corporation's domesticoperations service international business. As these operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjectiveassumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expenses between domesticand international operations. Estimates of the following are allocated on amanagement accounting basis: stockholders' equity, interest costs charged tousers of funds, and overhead, administrative and other expenses incurred by onearea on behalf of another. The provision for losses is allocated based onactual net charge-offs and changes in outstandings. Although the Corporation considers the balance in the non-LDCallowance for losses to be available for both domestic and foreign losses, aportion of the allowance is allocated, based on a methodology consistent withthe allocation of the provision for losses, to international operations.(a) No geographic region included in other international amounts to more than10% of the total for the Corporation.NOTE TWENTYTWOPARENT COMPANYCondensed financial information of Chemical Banking Corporation, the ParentCompany, is presented on the next page. For purposes of preparing the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cashequivalents are those amounts included in the balance sheet caption cash withbanks. B77  89NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(a) At December 31, 1993, aggregate annual maturities and sinking fundrequirements for all issues for the years 1994 through 1998 were $937 million,$844 million, $679 million, $472 million, and $596 million, respectively.B78  90NOTE TWENTYTHREESHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLANThe Corporation has in place a Shareholders' Rights Plan. The Shareholders'Rights Plan contains provisions intended to protect stockholders in the eventof unsolicited offers or attempts to acquire the Corporation, including offersthat do not treat all stockholders equally, acquisitions in the open market ofshares constituting control without offering fair value to all stockholders,and other coercive or unfair takeover tactics that could impair the Board ofDirectors' ability to represent stockholders' interests fully. TheShareholders' Rights Plan provides that attached to each share of common stockis one right (a "Right") to purchase a unit consisting of one one-hundredth ofa share (a "Unit") of Junior Participating Preferred Stock for an exerciseprice of $150 per unit, subject to adjustment. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights may causesubstantial dilution to a person that attempts to acquire the Corporationwithout the approval of the Board of Directors unless the offer is conditionedon a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights, however, shouldnot affect offers for all outstanding shares of common stock at a fair priceand otherwise in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders asdetermined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, at itsoption, redeem all, but not fewer than all, of the then outstanding Rights atany time until the 10th business day following a public announcement that aperson or a group had acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of theCorporation's outstanding common stock or total voting power.(a) The Corporation's common stock is listed and traded on the New York StockExchange and the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom andRepublic of Ireland. The high, low and closing prices of the Corporation'scommon stock are from the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape.
