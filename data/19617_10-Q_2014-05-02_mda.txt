>Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.At March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.4 billion&#32;and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(89) million&#32;and $(99) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 on pages 318&#8211;324&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report, and Note 21 on pages 155&#8211;158&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe table below presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk to which the structured notes' embedded derivative relates.99Note 5 &#8211; Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The Firm's disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm's derivatives are designated in hedge &nbsp;accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm's market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm's primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.100Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm's derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.101Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.102The following table presents, as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013,&#160;the gross and net derivative receivables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative payables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the receivables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting against related derivative payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.103The following table presents, as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013,&#160;the gross and net derivative payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative payables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative receivables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the payables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting against related derivative receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.104In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with net derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm's derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is comprised of &nbsp;non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained. The following tables present information regarding certain financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the derivative instruments for which appropriate legal opinions have been obtained; excluded are (i) additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and (ii) all collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.&#32;Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresFor a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm's derivative contracts, see Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.&nbsp;105The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of IncomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.106Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $39 million&#32;(after-tax) of net gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) at March 31, 2014, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2014, and 2013.(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three months ended March 31, 2014, and 2013.107Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&nbsp;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm's market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 on page 110&#32;of this Form 10-Q for information on principal transactions revenue. 108Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, where JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.109Note 6 &#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note 7 on pages 234&#8211;235 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue by major underlying type of risk exposures. &nbsp;The following table presents the components of firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.Other incomeIncluded in other income is operating lease income of $398 million&#32;and $349 million&#32;for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively. 110Note 7 &#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note 8 on page 236 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows. 111Note 8 &#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, see Note 9 on pages 237&#8211;246&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.3 billion&#32;and $3.6 billion, as of March 31, 2014, and $16.1 billion&#32;and $3.5 billion&#32;respectively, as of December 31,2013. See Note 19 on page 153&#32;of this Form 10-Q for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three months periods ended March 31, 2014, and 2013.The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2014&#32;at this time. For 2014&#32;, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $37 million. The 2014&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $49 million&#32;and $2 million, respectively.Note 9 &#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note 10 on pages 247&#8211;248&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2014, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2013 performance year, the Firm granted 36 million&#32;RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $57.87&#32;per RSU.Note 10 &#8211; Noninterest expenseThe following table presents the components of noninterest expense.112Note 11 &#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as AFS, held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) or trading. Securities classified as trading are discussed in Note 3 on pages 86&#8211;97&#32;of this Form 10-Q. Predominantly all of the Firm's AFS and HTM investment securities (the &#8220;investment securities portfolio&#8221;) are held by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At both March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 on pages 249&#8211;254 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion&#32;from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax unrealized &nbsp;losses of $9 million&#32;on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect the Firm's intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures under Basel III.Realized gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.113Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.114Other-than-temporary impairmentFor the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Firm recognized $3 million&#32;of OTTI losses related to securities the Firm intends to sell. The Firm did not recognize any OTTI losses for the three months ended March 31, 2013.Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesDuring the three months ended March 31, 2013, the credit loss component of credit-impaired securities was reduced by $3 million&#32;due to the sales of the securities. The Firm did not experience any changes to the credit loss component of credit-impaired securities during the three months ended March 31, 2014.Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally decreased since December 31, 2013. Though losses on securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have increased, the increase is not material. The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of March 31, 2014, the Firm does not intend to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities noted above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities in an unrealized loss position are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2014.115Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March 31, 2014, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.116Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activities For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 on pages 255&#8211;257 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been &nbsp;elected, see Note 4 on pages 98&#8211;99&#32;of this Form 10-Q. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22 on page 159&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table presents as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the gross and net securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities borrowed are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table presents information as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, regarding the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement.&#160;The below table excludes information related to resale agreements and securities borrowed where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.117The following table presents as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned. Securities sold under repurchase agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities purchased under resale agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities sold under repurchase agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities loaned are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table presents information as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, regarding the securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement.&#160;The below table excludes information related to repurchase agreements and securities loaned where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm held $12.9 billion&#32;and $14.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been &nbsp;recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets, other assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, and accounts payable and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.118Note 13 &#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 98&#8211;99&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 on pages 86&#8211;97&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:119The following tables summarize the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.The following table provides information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.The following table provides information about gains/(losses) on loan sales by portfolio segment.120Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.&nbsp;For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm's residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days&#32;past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.121122(table continued from previous page)123The following tables represent the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of March&#160;31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.(a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual that require interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the collateral does not support the loan amount.Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options &nbsp;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm's delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.124Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on page 140&#32;of this Form 10-Q.125The following table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Loan modificationsThe Firm is required to provide &#8220;borrower relief&#8221; under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This &#8220;borrower relief&#8221; includes reductions of principal and forbearance. For further information on these Consent Orders and settlements, see Business changes and developments in Note 2 on pages 192&#8211;194&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There are no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.126TDR activity rollforwardThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, modified in TDRs for the periods presented.Nature and extent of modificationsMaking Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;), as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term &nbsp;or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At March&#160;31, 2014, there were approximately 36,100&#32;of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 8,600&#32;senior lien home equity loans, 21,600&#32;junior lien home equity loans, 3,000&#32;prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 2,900&#32;subprime mortgages.127Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the Firm's loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.Approximately 85%&#32;of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the HAMP program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At March&#160;31, 2014, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months, are 17%&#32;for senior lien home equity, 20%&#32;for junior lien home equity, 15%&#32;for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 25%&#32;for subprime mortgages.&nbsp;Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge.&#160;Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days&#32;past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10%&#32;and 40%&#32;in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At March&#160;31, 2014, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 19%&#32;of senior lien home equity, 11%&#32;of junior lien home equity, 30%&#32;of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 20%&#32;of subprime mortgages that were 30 days&#32;or more past due.At March&#160;31, 2014, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6&#32;years for senior lien home equity, 7&#32;years for junior lien home equity, 9&#32;years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8&#32;years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).128Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.129Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.The following table presents average impaired loans for the periods presented.Loan modificationsThe following table provides information about the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above.130TDR activity rollforwardThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances of other consumer loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsFor auto loans, TDRs typically occur in connection with the bankruptcy of the borrower. In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness. Beginning September 30, 2012, Chapter 7 auto loans are also considered TDRs.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions.&nbsp;The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $7 million&#32;and $12 million&#32;during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively. The balance of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year&#32;of the modification, was $11 million&#32;and $13 million&#32;during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two&#32;payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans for the periods presented.131Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.132Approximately 20%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth &nbsp;delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of March&#160;31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013, and represents the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Since the date of acquisition, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, to extended loan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended or shortened loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expected cash flows and the accretable yield percentage, but not the amount of cash expected to be &nbsp;received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). While extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage (because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time), shortened loan liquidation periods would have the opposite effect.133Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's credit card loans.&nbsp;Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.134The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60 months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs.&#160;New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013, were $233 million&#32;and $339 million, respectively.&#160;For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 30.43%&#32;and 30.72%&#32;for credit card loans modified as of March&#160;31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, respectively.135Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Notes 14 and 15 on pages 258&#8211;287&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.136(table continued from previous page)(table continued from previous page)137Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans are comprised of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on page 140&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.138Loan modificationsCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. For further information, see Note 14 on page 260&#32;and pages 282&#8211;283&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.The following table provides information about the Firm's wholesale loans that have been modified in TDRs, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of such loans and information regarding the nature and extent of modifications during the periods presented.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsWholesale loans modified as TDRs are typically term or payment extensions and, to a lesser extent, deferrals of principal and/or interest on commercial and industrial and real estate loans. For the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 1.0&#32;years and 2.4&#32;years, respectively. The weighted-average &nbsp;remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.6&#32;years and 1.7&#32;years, respectively. There were no wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.139Note 14 &#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 on pages 284&#8211;287&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.140Note 15 &#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;), see Note 1 on pages 189&#8211;190 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 144 of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 on page 289 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm's primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 145&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CIB and CCB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm's involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 on pages 289&#8211;292 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.141The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 146&#32;of this Note for further information regarding the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities on pages 146&#8211;147&#32;of this Note for information on the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies. 142Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 on page 291 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.At March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 145&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 on page 291 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report. See the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase'sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 on pages 291&#8211;292 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.During the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Firm transferred $5.3 billion&#32;and $4.2 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $169 million&#32;and zero, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm consolidated $84 million&#32;and $86 million, respectively, of assets, and $22 million&#32;and $23 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 145&#32;of this Note for more information on consolidated re-securitization transactions.&nbsp;As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $2.9 billion&#32;and $2.8 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm held approximately $1.4 billion&#32;and $1.3 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $19 million&#32;and $6 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 142&#32;of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 288&#8211;296 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $4.9 billion&#32;and $4.1 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments were not driven by market liquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity, and credit enhancement provided by the Firm to the multi-seller conduits have been eliminated in consolidation.&#160; Unfunded lending-related commitments made to clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits were $10.3 billion&#32;and $9.1 billion&#32;at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21 on pages 155&#8211;158&#32;of this Form 10-Q.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 293&#8211;294 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.143The Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, was as follows.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 294&#8211;296 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Exposure to nonconsolidated credit-related note and asset swap VIEs at March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was as follows.&nbsp;The Firm consolidated credit-related note vehicles with collateral fair values of $324 million&#32;and $311 million, at March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, respectively. These consolidated VIEs included some that were structured by the Firm where the Firm provides the credit derivative, and some that have been structured by third parties where the Firm is not the credit derivative provider. The Firm consolidated these vehicles because it held positions in these entities that provided the Firm with control. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as aderivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor,underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. Thesetransactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individualcredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specificVIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlyingassets. Where the Firm does not have the power to directthe activities of the VIE that most significantly impact theVIE's economic performance, or a variable interest thatcould potentially be significant, the Firm records andreports these positions on its Consolidated Balance Sheetssimilarly to the way it would record and report positions inrespect of any other third-party transaction.144Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.145Loan SecuritizationsThe Firm securitizes a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans. For a further &nbsp;description of the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note 16 on page 288 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Cash flows from securitizationsThe following table provides information related to the Firm's securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the &#8220;Agencies&#8221;). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans and excess mortgage servicing rights through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 on pages 318&#8211;324 of the JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 on pages 148&#8211;151&#32;of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the impact of the Firm's sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights.&nbsp;The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. agencies and third-party-sponsored securitization entities.146Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21 on pages 155&#8211;158&#32;of this Form 10-Q, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm may elect to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $14.0 billion&#32;and $14.3 &nbsp;billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $2.1 billion&#32;and $2.0&#160;billion&#32;as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 13 on pages 119&#8211;139&#32;of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of March 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.147Note 16 &#8211; Goodwill and other intangible assetsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillThe following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.Goodwill impairment testingFor further description of the Firm's goodwill impairment testing process, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, see Impairment testing on pages 299&#8211;300&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Goodwill was not impaired at March&#160;31, 2014, or December&#160;31, 2013, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013.While no impairment of goodwill was recognized, the Firm's Mortgage Banking business in CCB remains at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. economic conditions and the effects of regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of this business is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities), and the amount of equity capital required. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models including the amount of capital necessary given the risk of business activities to meet regulatory capital requirements were determined using management's best estimates. The cost of equity reflected the related risks and uncertainties, and was evaluated in comparison to relevant market peers. Deterioration in these assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of these reporting units and their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which may result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.Mortgage servicing rightsMortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report&#32;and Note 3 on pages 86&#8211;97&#32;of this Form 10-Q.148The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2014&#32;and 2013.149The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and three months ended&#32;March 31, 2014&#32;and 2013.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm's MSRs at March 31, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsThe $129 million&#32;decrease in other intangible assets during the three months ended&#32;March 31, 2014, was due to amortization.150<hr
