Table of ContentsOnce a CDO vehicle closes and issues securities, the Firm has no further obligation to providesupport to the vehicle. At the time of closing, the Firm may hold unsold positions that the Firmwas not able to place with third-party investors. The amount of unsold positions at March&nbsp;31, 2008,was insignificant. In addition, the Firm may on occasion hold some of the CDO vehicles' securitiesas a secondary market-maker or as a principal investor, or it may be a derivative counterparty tothe vehicles. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, these amounts were not significant.Consolidated VIE assetsThe following table summarizes the Firm's total consolidated VIE assets, by classification, on theConsolidated Balance Sheets, as of March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified inthe line item titled, &#147;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities&#148; onthe Consolidated Balance Sheets. The holders of these beneficial interests do not have recourse tothe general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 21 on page 159 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport for the maturity profile of FIN 46 long-term beneficial interests.NOTE 16 &#150; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS For a discussion of accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note18 on pages 154&#150;157 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.98 Table of ContentsGoodwillThe $425&nbsp;million increase in goodwill from 2007 largely resulted from the purchase of an additionalequity interest in Highbridge. For additional information, see Note 2 on page 74 of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill was not impaired at March&nbsp;31, 2008, or December&nbsp;31, 2007, nor was any goodwill written offdue to impairment during either the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008, or March&nbsp;31, 2007.Goodwill attributed to the business segments was as follows.Mortgage servicing rightsFor a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and valuationmethodology of MSRs, see Notes 4 and 18 on pages 113 and 154&#150;157 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport, respectively. The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, includingtheir effect on prepayment speeds. JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of derivatives and tradinginstruments to manage changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in thefair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. MSRsdecrease in value when interest rates decline. Conversely, securities (such as mortgage&#150;backedsecurities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (when the Firm receives fixed-rateinterest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007.99 Table of ContentsThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's MSRs at March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively; and it outlines thesensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.CPR: Constant prepayment rateThe sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution.Changes in fair value based upon a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be easilyextrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair valuemay not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption mayhave on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes inone factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.Purchased credit card relationships and all other intangible assetsFor the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2008, purchased credit card relationships, other creditcard-related intangibles and core deposit intangibles decreased $299&nbsp;million, primarily as a resultof amortization expense. Other intangibles increased $155&nbsp;million, as a result of the purchase ofan additional equity interest in Highbridge.Except for $514&nbsp;million of indefinite-lived intangibles related to asset management advisorycontracts which are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, theremainder of the Firm's other acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization.The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were asfollows.Amortization expenseThe following table presents amortization expense related to credit card relationships, coredeposits and all other intangible assets.100 Table of ContentsFuture amortization expenseThe following table presents estimated future amortization expense related to credit cardrelationships, core deposits and all other intangible assets at March&nbsp;31, 2008.NOTE 17 &#150; DEPOSITS At March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were asfollows.NOTE 18 &#150; EARNINGS PER SHAREFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;), see Note24 on page 161 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The following table presents thecalculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007.NOTE 19 &#150; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;includes the after-tax change in SFAS 115unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, SFAS 52 foreign currency translation adjustments(including the impact of related derivatives), SFAS 133 cash flow hedging activities and SFAS158 net loss and prior service cost (credit)&nbsp;related to the Firm's defined benefit pension andOPEB plans.101 Table of Contents102 Table of ContentsNOTE 20 &#150; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFor a discussion of the Firm's potential liability related to The Bank of New York MellonCorporation's (&#147;BNYM&#148;) difficulties in locating certain documentation, including IRS Forms W-8 andW-9, related to certain accounts transferred to BNYM in connection with the Firm's sale of itscorporate trust business, see Note 29 on page 167 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Litigation reserveThe Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. In accordancewith the provisions of SFAS 5, JPMorgan Chase accrues for a litigation-related liability when it isprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated. When the Firm is named a defendant in a litigation and may be subject to joint andseveral liability and a judgment sharing agreement is in place, the Firm recognizes expense andobligations net of amounts expected to be paid by other signatories to the judgment-sharingagreement.While the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in light of allinformation known to it at March&nbsp;31, 2008, the Firm's litigation reserves were adequate at such date. Management reviewslitigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increased or decreased in the future toreflect further relevant developments. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to claimsasserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and, with respect to such litigation,intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according tomanagement's judgment as to what is in the best interests of stockholders.NOTE 21 &#150; ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESThe majority of JPMorgan Chase's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes. Derivativesare also utilized by the Firm as an end-user to hedge market exposures, to modify the interestrate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments or to meet longer-term investmentobjectives. Both trading and end-user derivatives are recorded in trading assets and tradingliabilities. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regardingderivative instruments, see Note 30 on pages 168&#150;169 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. Thefollowing table presents derivative instrument hedging-related activities for the periodsindicated.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, it is expected that $282&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recorded inother comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;at March&nbsp;31, 2008, will be recognized in earnings. The maximumlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and such transactionsprimarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.NOTE 22 &#150; OFF&#150;BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEESFor a discussion of off&#150;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, andthe Firm's related accounting policies, see Note 31 on pages 170&#150;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007Annual Report. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, anallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 13 on pages88&#150;89 of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses onlending-related commitments.103 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes thecontractual amounts of off-balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments and guarantees (excluding those related to Bear Stearns) and the relatedallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31,2007.Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guaranteesIncluded in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to investment andnoninvestment grade counterparties in connection with leveraged acquisitions. These commitments aredependent on whether the acquisition by the borrower is successful, tend to be short-term in natureand, in most cases, are subject to certain conditions based on the borrower's financial conditionor other factors. Additionally, the Firm often syndicates portions of the initial position to otherinvestors, depending on market conditions. These commitments generally contain flexible pricingfeatures to adjust for changing market conditions prior to closing. Alternatively, the borrower mayturn to the capital markets for required funding instead of drawing on the commitment provided bythe Firm, and the commitment may expire unused. As such, these commitments are not necessarilyindicative of the Firm's actual risk and the total commitment amount may not reflect actual futurecash flow requirements. The amount of these commitments at March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,were $8.3&nbsp;billion and $8.2&nbsp;billion, respectively.For afurther discussion of the off-balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considersto be guarantees under FIN 45, and the related accounting policies,see Note 31 on pages 170&#150;173of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The amount of the liability related to FIN 45 guaranteesrecorded at March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments andderivative contracts and those related to Bear Stearns as discussedbelow, was $360&nbsp;million and $335&nbsp;million,respectively.104 Table of ContentsIn addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which theFirm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. For a discussionof the derivatives the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, seeNote 31 on pages 170&#150;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The total notional value of thederivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $96.1&nbsp;billion and $85.3&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31,2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. The fair value related to these contracts was aderivative receivable of $205&nbsp;million and $213&nbsp;million, and a derivative payable of $6.1&nbsp;billionand $2.5&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.Bear StearnsIn connection with the merger agreement with Bear Stearns, JPMorgan Chase entered intoagreements to guarantee (A)&nbsp;certainobligations of Bear Stearns and certain of its affiliates, including (1)&nbsp;revolving and termloan obligations, (2)&nbsp;brokerage and trading contract obligations and (3)&nbsp;obligations to delivercash, securities or other property to customers pursuant to customarycustody arrangements and (B)&nbsp;obligations of Bear Stearns and certain of itsaffiliates to the FRBNY in order to ensure continuedaccess by Bear Stearns to the discount window facility established by the FRBNY for primarydealers. Theseguarantees are secured by liens on assets of Bear Stearns that arenot otherwise pledged. These assets are comprised mainly of fixed assets and other nonfinancialassets. The carrying amount of the liability to stand ready to perform under the Bear Stearnsguarantees was $669&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2008. These amounts are not included in the amountsdisclosed above. It is not possible to calculate the maximum potential amount of future paymentsunder the guarantees, or the extent to which proceeds from the liquidation of the assets pledged toJPMorgan Chase would be expected to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments under theguarantees since the underlying contract amounts that are guaranteed change on a daily basis.However, the Firm believes the risk of loss to be remote.NOTE 23 &#150; BUSINESS SEGMENTSJPMorgan Chase is organized into six major reportable business segments &#150; Investment Bank, RetailFinancial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking (&#147;CB&#148;), Treasury & Securities Services(&#147;TSS&#148;) and Asset Management (&#147;AM&#148;), as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment.

In addition, the Firm's senior management may make forward-lookingstatements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many ofwhich are beyond the Firm's control. JPMorgan Chase's actual future results may differ materiallyfrom those set forth in its forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any listof risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could causeactual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements.114 Table of ContentsAny forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they aremade and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect theimpact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firmmay make in any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or CurrentReports on Form 8-K.Item&nbsp;3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the MarketRisk Management section of the MD&A on pages 61&#150;64 of this Form 10-Q.Item&nbsp;4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under thesupervision and with the participation of the Firm's management, including its Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based uponthat evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concludedthat these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for theCertification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief FinancialOfficer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting.Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting maynot prevent or detect misstatements.There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the first quarter of 2008that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm's internalcontrol over financial reporting.Part II Other InformationItem&nbsp;1 Legal proceedingsThe following information supplements and amends the disclosure set forth under Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3&#147;Legal proceedings&#148; in the Firm's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Enron Litigation. As previously disclosed, there is pending a putative class action on behalf ofJPMorgan Chase employees who participated in the Firm's 401(k) plan, alleging claims under theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) against the Firm, its directors and namedofficers. On February&nbsp;20, 2008, plaintiffs sought remand of their appeal, based on new controllingauthority by the United States Supreme Court. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that theDistrict Court's decision could be affirmed based on other arguments that had been presented tothat court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied plaintiffs' requestfor remand on April&nbsp;9, 2008, but allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to submit a reply brief.IPO Allocation Litigation. With respect to the IPO securities cases, on March&nbsp;26, 2008, theDistrict Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Underwriter Defendants'motion to dismiss the Amended Master Allegations and second amended class action complaints filedin the six class certification &#147;focus&#148; cases. The District Court granted the UnderwriterDefendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims brought under Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Actof 1933 by plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial publicoffering price, and by those plaintiffs who purchased outside the previously certified classperiod, but denied the Underwriter Defendants' motion to dismiss on all other grounds. In addition,the class certification motion in the &#147;focus&#148; cases have been fully briefed. Finally, a motion bythe Underwriter Defendants to strike the class allegations in 26 cases on grounds relating to thestatus of the putative class representatives in those cases has been fully briefed. With respectto the cases filed by plaintiff Vanessa Simmonds in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Washington, all of the cases were reassigned to Judge James L. Robart to whomthe first case had been assigned, and amended complaints have been filed.115 Table of ContentsNational Century Financial Enterprises Litigation. The Firm completed a settlement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which it consented to an order that it agreed tocease and desist from committing or causing any future violations of the Securities Act of 1933,and paid disgorgement of $1,286,808.82 and prejudgment interest of $711,335.76. The Firm also hascompleted settlements with MetLife and with Lloyds TSB in the multidistrict civil litigation.In re JPMorgan Chase Cash Balance Litigation. On March&nbsp;17, 2008, the District Court stayed theoriginal cash balance plan litigation for up to one year pending a decision by the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Hirt v. The Equitable Ret. Plan of Employees, Manager &Agents, No.&nbsp;06-cv-4757, a case in which the Firm is not involved but which raises similar issues,including the question of whether the conversion to, and use of, a cash balance formula violatesERISA's proscription against age discrimination. The Hirt appeal was argued on April&nbsp;22, 2008. Inaccordance with the scheduling order in Bilello v. JPMorgan Chase Retirement Plan, et al., No.07-cv-7379 (S.D.N.Y.), defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and that motionis now fully briefed.Interchange Litigation. Plaintiffs had filed a supplemental complaint challenging MasterCard's2006 initial public offering, alleging that the offering violates the Section&nbsp;7 of the Clayton Act,Section&nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act and that the offering was a fraudulent conveyance. Defendants filed amotion to dismiss both of those claims. On February&nbsp;13, 2008, the Magistrate Judge issued a Reportand Recommendation granting the motion to dismiss the fraudulent conveyance claims against theDefendant Banks and MasterCard, and the Clayton Act claims as to the Defendant Banks, with leave toreplead all claims consistent with the decision. The Magistrate Judge denied the motion to dismissthe Clayton Act claims against MasterCard and the Section&nbsp;1 Sherman Act claims against alldefendants. On April&nbsp;4, 2008, the Defendants filed their objections to the Report andRecommendation. Plaintiffs will file a response to the objections on May&nbsp;12, 2008. The DistrictCourt will then review the Report and Recommendation as well as the objections and issue a finaldecision. Discovery in the case is ongoing.GIC Investigation. On March&nbsp;18, 2008, the staff of the Philadelphia Regional Office of the SECissued a &#147;Wells&#148; notice advising J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (&#147;JPMSI&#148;), that it is consideringrecommending that the Commission bring an enforcement action against JPMSI, alleging that JPMSIviolated the federal securities laws &#147;in connection with the bidding of various financialinstruments associated with municipal securities.&#148; In addition,beginning in March&nbsp;2008, the Firm, along with numerous other commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies andbrokers, were named as defendants in several putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courtin the District of Columbia, the Southern District of New York, and the Northern District ofCalifornia for alleged antitrust violations in connection with the bidding or sale of guaranteedinvestment contracts and other derivatives to municipal issuers. Plaintiffs in one of the pendingactions moved before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer and coordinatethese cases in the District of Columbia. The Firm and the majority of its co-defendants have joinedin the request for coordination but have argued that the coordination should take place in theSouthern District of New York. In addition, the Firm is continuing to cooperate with theinvestigations being conducted by the New York State field office of the Department of Justice's AntitrustDivision and the Philadelphia Regional Office of the SEC.BearStearns Merger Litigation. During the week of March&nbsp;17, 2008, various stockholders of Bear Stearns filed two putative class actions naming as defendantsBear Stearns, certain members of its board of directors, and certain of Bear Stearns' present andformer executive officers (collectively, the &#147;Bear Stearns defendants&#148;), as well as the Firm. TheFirm's officers and directors are not named as defendants. The actions which were filed in theSupreme Court of the New York State Court allege, among other things, that the individualdefendants breached their fiduciary duties and obligations to Bear Stearns' shareholders byagreeing to the proposed merger. The Firm is alleged to have aided and abetted the alleged breachesof fiduciary duty. Three similar putative class actions were also filed in the Supreme Court of theState of New York by shareholders that named only the Bear Stearns defendants. These actions havebeen consolidated in the Supreme Court of the State of New York as a putative class action, underthe caption In re Bear Stearns Litigation (the &#147;New York action&#148;). The Firm is named as a defendantin the consolidated action. Plaintiffs initially sought to enjoin the proposed merger and enjoin the Firm fromvoting certain shares acquired by the Firm in connection with the proposed merger. A hearing onthe plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in theconsolidated New York State action was scheduled for May&nbsp;8, 2008,but the plaintiffs informed the Court that they were withdrawing themotion. Plaintiffs have also informed the Court that they intend topursue their claims, which include a claim for an unspecified amountof compensatory damages, in the ordinary course. The defendants haveinformed the Court that they intend to move for summary judgement.That motion will be argued on July&nbsp;21. Two actions related to the proposed merger were also filed in DelawareCourt of Chancery making similar allegations to the New York action and those actions wereconsolidated in the Delaware Chancery Court (the &#147;Delaware action&#148;). On April&nbsp;9, 2008, the DelawareChancery Court granted the Firm's and Bear Stearns' motion to stay the Delaware action in favor ofthe New York action, at least until the preliminary injunction motion is resolved. The plaintiffsin the Delaware action intervened in the116 Table of ContentsNew York action and onMay&nbsp;7, 2008, the Delaware Chancery Court signed a stipulationand proposed order submitted by the parties dismissing the Delawareaction. Inaddition, the plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit pendingagainst Bear Stearns (to which the Firm is not a party) in federalcourt in the Southern District of New York, which does containmerger-related allegations, have sent a letter to the Court seekingexpedited discovery and stating their intention to seek a preliminaryinjunction against the merger. The Firm has submitted a letter to theCourt opposing this request and requesting an opportunity to be heardon the motion should the Court agree to entertain it.In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations discussed above, JPMorgan Chaseand its subsidiaries are named as defendants or otherwise involved in a number of other legalactions and governmental proceedings arising in connection with their businesses. Additionalactions, investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. In view ofthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where theclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legaltheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannotstate with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timingof the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties orimpact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its currentknowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigationreserves, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pendingagainst it should not have a material, adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition ofthe Firm. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions andinvestigations, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will notsignificantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of aparticular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period,depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level ofJPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of certain risk factors affecting the Firm, seePart&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;1A: Risk Factors, onpages 4-6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report onForm&nbsp;10-K and Forward-Looking Statements on page 114 of thisForm 10-Q. Additionally, below are outlined some of the moreimportant risk factors relating to JPMorganChase's proposed merger with Bear Stearns and related transactions that could materially affect theFirm's financial condition and operations. For a discussion ofthe terms of the merger and related transactions, see Other Business Events,beginning on page&nbsp;5 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.If the merger is not consummated, JPMorgan Chase would nevertheless continue to have exposure as aresult of its guaranties of certain Bear Stearns liabilities.As of March&nbsp;24, 2008, Bear Stearns had virtually no available cash and insufficient unencumberedassets to secure funding in the credit markets from any source other than JPMorgan Chase and theFederal Reserve Bank of New York (&#147;FRBNY&#148;). As of the close of business on Friday, March&nbsp;21, 2008, Bear Stearns had outstandingborrowings of approximately $32.5&nbsp;billion from the FRBNY, had borrowed approximately $3.7billion from the Firm through repurchase agreements and had borrowed approximately an additional$9.7&nbsp;billion from the Firm. In addition, Bear Stearns has been engaging in continued business activities,albeit at significantly reduced levels since the merger announcement. As such, Bear Stearns has incurredoperating liabilities for which JPMorgan Chase is a guarantor. It is not possible to quantify theamount of those liabilities, as they are subject to constant change. There is no assurance any ofthe borrowings or obligations of Bear Stearns that are covered by theFirm's guarantees will notincrease over time, and such amounts could have a negative impact on the Firm's financial results.Currently,there are cases pending in the New York State and federal courts that assert various claimsagainst Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Chase, seeking, among other things,to enjoin the proposed merger. See Part II, Item&nbsp;1, Legalproceedings, beginning on page 115 of this Form 10-Q.If Bear Stearns' stockholders fail to approve the merger, then either party may terminate themerger agreement 120&nbsp;days following such failure. In the event of such termination, or upon anyother termination of the merger agreement, the merger would not be consummated, and the operatingguarantee would terminate in accordance with its terms for any liabilities or obligations arisingthereafter. Nevertheless, other than following a termination due to a change in recommendation bythe board of directors of Bear Stearns prompted by a competing transaction proposal, JPMorganChase's guarantee of obligations up to that date would remain in effect. In addition, if the mergeragreement were terminated, JPMorgan Chase would have the right to terminate its guarantee of Bear Stearns'borrowings from the FRBNY. If either or both of these actions were to occur, Bear Stearnswould most likely be unable to finance its operations. In addition, absent the operating guarantee,Bear Stearns would face the increased risk of rapid loss of clients and counterparties. The lack ofliquidity and the loss of additional clients and counterparties would seriously jeopardize Bear Stearns'financial viability, which would raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a goingconcern.117 Table of ContentsAccordingly, Bear Stearns could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection and toliquidate its assets, and creditors could look to JPMorgan Chase as guarantor to satisfy BearStearns' obligations covered by the operating guarantee. In a bankruptcy proceeding, the likelihoodof the Firm recovering all of the funds owed to it would be uncertain and this could have anegative impact on its financial condition and results of operations.Even if the merger is consummated, the Firm may fail to realize any benefits and may incurunanticipated losses related to Bear Stearns assets and liabilities that it is assuming pursuant tothe merger.Inconnection with the merger agreement, the FRBNY has agreed to provide JPMorgan Chase with$30&nbsp;billion in funding secured by a pool of collateral consisting primarily of mortgage-relatedsecurities and other mortgage-related assets and related hedges. Of this $30&nbsp;billion financing,JPMorgan Chase would bear the first $1&nbsp;billion in losses associated with the collateral pool, andthe remaining $29&nbsp;billion will be non-recourse. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase willnot incur this $1&nbsp;billion in losses.Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase will assume all assets and liabilities of Bear Stearns and itssubsidiaries (other than the $30&nbsp;billion of assets subject tothe funding being provided by the FRBNY). Given recent market volatility and uncertainty, there could be substantial riskassociated with assuming the assets and liabilities of Bear Stearns that the Firm will acquire as aresult of the merger. Some of those assets could become nonperforming or defaulting, requiringwrite-downs and additional reserves. As a result, JPMorgan Chase may experience increased creditcosts or need to take markdowns on assets that could negatively affect its financial condition andresults of operations.If the merger is consummated, itssuccess will depend, in part, on JPMorgan Chase's ability tosuccessfully combine its business with Bear Stearns' business. To realize these anticipatedbenefits, after the completion of the merger the Firm expects to integrate Bear Stearns' businessinto its own. As with any merger of financial institutions, there may be business disruptions thatcause Bear Stearns to lose customers or cause customers to removetheir accounts from Bear Stearns and move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integrationprocess could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoingbusinesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affectJPMorgan Chase's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors andemployees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase's ability to successfully conductits business in the markets in which Bear Stearns now operates, which could have an adverse effecton the Firm's financial results. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divertmanagement attention and resources. If JPMorgan Chase experiences difficulties with the integrationprocess, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may takelonger to realize than expected.In addition, immediately prior to entering into the merger agreement, Bear Stearns experienced asignificant liquidity crisis during the end of the week of March&nbsp;10, 2008, which seriouslyjeopardized its financial viability. As a result of this liquidity crisis and the events thatfollowed, Bear Stearns' earnings capacity has declined significantly. During and following theliquidity crisis, a substantial number of prime brokerage clients moved accounts to other clearingbrokers. Customer margin balances at Bear Stearns were $66&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;24, 2008, down 23% from$86&nbsp;billion at November&nbsp;30, 2007; customer shorts atMarch&nbsp;24, 2008 were $66&nbsp;billion, down from $88billion at the fiscal year end; and assets under management declined to approximately $36&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;24,2008, down 20% from $45&nbsp;billion at the fiscal year end. As ofApril&nbsp;14, 2008, institutional equity and fixed income commission and sales activityhad declined precipitously to more than 50% below the activity levels in 2007 and the first quarterof 2008.Consequently the Bear Stearns franchise hasexperienced substantial deterioration of its earnings capacity subsequentto its liquidity crisis, including continued deterioration in recentweeks.There is no assurance that customers and counterparties will return to doing business with BearStearns now that the operating guarantee is in place. If such customers and counterpartiesdetermine to conduct their business with financial institutions other than Bear Stearns, there isno assurance that, upon consummation of the merger, such former customers and counterparties willtransfer their business from their then current financial institution to the combined company.Accordingly, the pro forma financial statements of the twoentities filed with the SEC by the Firm in a Current Report onForm&nbsp;8-K on April&nbsp;16, 2008, as amended May&nbsp;6, 2008, should not be viewed as an indication of the results of the combined firm that wouldhave occurred had the merger been effected at the beginning of the period presented therein, nor asan indication of financial results of operations of the combined company that may occur in thefuture.118 Table of ContentsItem&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds For a discussion of the Firm's current stock repurchase program, see Stock repurchases, on page43, and Item&nbsp;5: Market for Registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuerpurchases of equity securities on pages 13&#150;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report on Form10-K.During the first quarter of 2008, shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. were issued intransactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2)thereof, as follows: (i)&nbsp;on January&nbsp;2, 2008, 9,694 shares were issued to retired directors who haddeferred receipt of such common stock pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-EmployeeDirectors; and (ii)&nbsp;on January&nbsp;22, 2008, 678 shares and on January&nbsp;30, 2008, 57,449 shares wereissued to retired employees who had deferred receipt of such common shares pursuant to theCorporate Performance Incentive Plan.On April&nbsp;17, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0&nbsp;billion of theFirm's common shares. The new authorization commenced April&nbsp;19, 2007, and replaced the Firm'sprevious $8.0&nbsp;billion repurchase program.During the first quarter of 2008, under the current $10.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program, theFirm did not repurchase any shares. During the first quarter of 2007, under the $8.0&nbsp;billion stockrepurchase program, the Firm repurchased 81&nbsp;million shares for $4.0&nbsp;billion at an average price per share of $49.45. As of March&nbsp;31, 2008,$6.2&nbsp;billion of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the current stock repurchase program.The Firm has determined that it may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of common stock inaccordance with the repurchase program. A Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchaseshares during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock, for example duringinternal trading &#147;black-out periods.&#148; All purchases under a Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 plan must be made accordingto a predefined plan that is established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublicinformation.Participants in the Firm's stock-based incentive plans may have shares withheld to cover incometaxes. Shares withheld to pay income taxes are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the applicableplan and not under the Firm's share repurchase program. Shares repurchased pursuant to these plansduring the first quarter of 2008 were as follows.Item&nbsp;3 Defaults Upon Senior SecuritiesNoneItem&nbsp;4 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security HoldersNoneItem&nbsp;5 Other InformationNoneItem&nbsp;6 Exhibits119 Table of ContentsSIGNATUREPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly causedthis report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.120 Table of ContentsINDEX TO EXHIBITSSEQUENTIALLY NUMBERED121 Exhibit&nbsp;31.1JPMorgan Chase & Co.CERTIFICATIONDate:May 12, 2008/s/ James Dimon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James DimonChairman and Chief Executive Officer122 Exhibit&nbsp;31.2JPMorgan Chase & Co.CERTIFICATIONDate:May 12, 2008/s/ Michael J.
