>Effective January 1, 2013, the Firm further refined the capital allocation framework to align it with the revised line of business structure that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses is largely driven by regulatory guidance on Basel III requirements, principally for CIB and CIO, and by anticipated business growth.Capital actionsDividendsOn May 21, 2013, the Board of Directors increased the Firm's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.38 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July&#160;31,&#160;2013, to shareholders of record on July 5, 2013. The Firm's common stock dividend policy reflects JPMorgan&#160;Chase's earnings outlook, desired dividend payout ratio, capital objectives, and alternative investment opportunities. The Firm's current expectation is to return to a payout ratio of approximately 30% of normalized earnings over time.For information regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22 and Note 27 on pages 300 and 306, respectively, of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.Preferred stockOn February 5, 2013 the Firm issued $900 million&#32;of noncumulative preferred stock. On each of April 23, 2013, and July 29, 2013, the Firm issued $1.5 billion&#32;of noncumulative preferred stock. On August 1, 2013, the Firm announced that it would redeem all of its outstanding 8.625%&#32;noncumulative preferred stock, Series J on September 1, 2013. For additional information on the Firm's preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 300 of the Firm's 2012 Annual Report.&nbsp;Redemption of outstanding trust preferred securitiesOn May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0&#160;billion, or 100%&#32;of the liquidation amount, of the following eight series of trust preferred securities: JPMorgan Chase Capital X, XI, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XXIV, and BANK ONE Capital VI. For a further discussion of trust preferred securities, see Note 21 on pages 297&#8211;299 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Common equity repurchasesOn March&#160;13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion&#32;common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. The following table shows the Firm's repurchases of common equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. As of June&#160;30, 2013, $9.6 billion&#32;(on a trade-date basis) of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program.Pursuant to CCAR, the Firm is authorized to repurchase up to $6 billion&#32;of common equity between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. Such repurchases are being done pursuant to the $15.0 billion&#32;common equity repurchase program.The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity &#8212; for example, during internal trading &#8220;black-out periods.&#8221; All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information. For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm's equity securities, see Part II, Item 2, Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds, on pages 218&#8211;219&#32;of this Form 10-Q.64Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase's business activities. The Firm's risk management framework and governance structure are intended to provide comprehensive controls and ongoing management of the major risks inherent in its business activities. The Firm employs a holistic approach to risk management intended to ensure the broad spectrum of risk types are considered in managing its business activities. The Firm's risk management framework is intended to create a culture of risk awareness and personal responsibility throughout the Firm where collaboration, discussion, escalation and sharing of information are encouraged.The Firm's overall risk appetite is established in the context of the Firm's capital, earnings power, and diversified business model. The Firm employs a formalized risk &nbsp;appetite framework to integrate the Firm's objectives with return targets, risk controls and capital management. The Risk Policy Committee of the Firm's Board of Directors approves the risk appetite policy on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Firm's Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;), Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), Chief Risk Officer (&#8220;CRO&#8221;) and Chief Operating Officer (&#8220;COO&#8221;) are responsible for setting and approving the Firm's risk appetite parameters. The lines of business CEOs, CFOs and CROs are responsible for setting the risk appetite parameters for their respective lines of business, subject to approval by the Firm's CEO, CFO, CRO and COO. The Firmwide Risk Committee, which is co-chaired by the Firm's CEO and CRO, is responsible for reviewing risk appetite results at the LOB and firmwide levels.The following provides an index of key risk management disclosures. For further information on these disclosures, refer to the page references noted below in both this Form 10-Q and JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report. 65Liquidity risk management is intended to ensure that the Firm has the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity in support of its assets. The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to ensure that the Firm's core businesses are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during market stress events and to maintain debt ratings that enable the Firm to optimize its funding mix and liquidity sources while minimizing costs. The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's Liquidity Risk Management framework highlights developments since December 31, 2012, and should be read in conjunction with pages 127&#8211;133 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Management considers the Firm's liquidity position to be strong as of June 30, 2013, and believes that the Firm's unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.LCR and NSFRIn December 2010, the Basel Committee introduced two new measures of liquidity risk: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), which is intended to measure the amount of &#8220;high-quality liquid assets&#8221; (&#8220;HQLA&#8221;) held by the Firm during an acute stress event, in relation to the estimated net cash outflows within a 30-day period; and the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) which is intended to measure the &#8220;available&#8221; amount of stable funding relative to the &#8220;required&#8221; amount of stable funding over a 1-year horizon. The standards require that the LCR be no lower than 100% and the NSFR be greater than 100%. For further discussion, see HQLA discussion on page 70&#32;of this Form 10-Q.In January 2013, the Basel Committee introduced certain amendments to the formulation of the LCR, and a revised timetable to phase-in the standard. The LCR will continue to become effective on January 1, 2015, but the minimum requirement will begin at 60%, increasing in equal annual increments to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. During the second quarter of 2013, the Firm accelerated compliance with the proposed Basel III LCR and became compliant, based on its current understanding of the proposed rules. The LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to normal flows from client activity. &nbsp;FundingSources of fundsThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm's loan portfolio, aggregating approximately $706.2 billion, net of allowance, at June 30, 2013 is funded with a portion of the Firm's deposits&#160;(aggregating approximately $1,203.0 billion at June 30, 2013), and&#160;through&#160;securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm's real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks.&#160;Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the Firm's available-for-sale securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Capital markets secured financing assets and trading assets are primarily funded by the Firm's capital market secured financing liabilities, trading liabilities and a portion of the Firm's long-term debt and equity.In addition to funding capital markets assets, components of the Firm's debt and equity are used to fund certain loans, and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm's available for sale securities portfolio. See the discussion below for additional disclosures relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance.DepositsA key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. As of June 30, 2013, the Firm's deposits-to-loans ratio was 166%, compared with 163% at December&#160;31, 2012.As of June 30, 2013, total deposits for the Firm were $1,203.0 billion, compared with $1,193.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012 (54%&#32;and 55%&#32;of total liabilities at June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively). The increase in deposits was predominantly due to growth in consumer deposits. For further information, see Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 53&#8211;54&#32;of this Form 10-Q.66The Firm typically experiences higher customer deposit inflows at period-ends. Therefore, the Firm believes average deposit balances are more representative of deposit trends. The table below summarizes, by line of business, the deposit balance as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, as well as average deposits for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.A significant portion of the Firm's deposits are consumer deposits (38%&#32;and 37% at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively), which are considered particularly stable as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes or market volatility. Additionally, the majority of the Firm's institutional deposits are also considered to be stable sources of funding since they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. For further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of the results for the Firm's business segments and the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 17&#8211;51&#32;and 53&#8211;54, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, and average balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For additional information, see the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 53&#8211;54&#32;and Note 12 on pages 151&#8211;152&#32;of this Form 10-Q.67Short-term fundingA significant portion of the total commercial paper liabilities, approximately 66%&#32;as of June 30, 2013, as shown in the table above, were originated from deposits that customers choose to sweep into commercial paper liabilities as a cash management program offered by CIB and are not sourced from wholesale funding markets.The Firm's sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt, agency debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant portion of the federal funds purchased and securities &nbsp;loaned or sold under purchase agreements. The amounts of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at June 30, 2013, increased predominantly due to higher secured financing of the Firm's assets and higher client financing activity. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers' investment and financing activities; the Firm's demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm's liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment and market-making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors.68Long-term funding and issuanceLong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The majority of the Firm's long-term unsecured funding is issued by the parent holding company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding.The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For additional information, see Note 21 on pages 297&#8211;299&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.On May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0 billion, or 100% of the liquidation amount, of trust preferredsecurities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions set forth in the documents governing those trust preferredsecurities. The Firm announced on August 1, 2013 that it would redeem all of its outstanding 8.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series J on September 1, 2013.During July 2013 and through August&#160;7, 2013, the Firm issued $1.0 billion of senior notes in the U.S. market.The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans, residential mortgages, auto loans and student loans as well as through advances from the FHLBs, all of which increase funding and investor diversity.The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemption for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 69In addition, in July 2013, the Firm securitized $900 million of consumer credit card loans.The Firm's wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, see Note 15 on pages 177&#8211;184&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Parent holding company and subsidiary fundingThe parent holding company acts as an important source of funding to its subsidiaries. The Firm's liquidity management is intended to ensure that liquidity at the parent holding company is maintained at levels sufficient to fund the operations of the parent holding company and its subsidiaries for an extended period of time in a stress environment where access to normal funding sources is disrupted.To effectively monitor the adequacy of liquidity and funding at the parent holding company, the Firm targets pre-funding of the parent holding company to ensure that both contractual and non-contractual obligations can be met for at least 18 months assuming no access to wholesale funding markets. However, due to conservative liquidity management actions taken by the Firm, the current pre-funding of such obligations is greater than target. For further discussion on liquidity at the parent holding company see Liquidity Risk Management on pages 127&#8211;133 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.High Quality Liquid AssetsHigh Quality Liquid Assets (&#8220;HQLA&#8221;) is the estimated amount of assets the Firm believes will qualify for inclusion in the Basel III LCR based on the Firm's current understanding of the rules. HQLA primarily consists of cash and certain unencumbered high quality, liquid assets as defined in the rule.As of June 30, 2013, HQLA was estimated to be approximately $454 billion, compared with $341 billion as of December 31, 2012. The increase in HQLA was due to higher cash balances driven by increased secured borrowings, trading liabilities and long term debt issuance as well as a reduction in trading assets, securities purchased under resale agreements and investment securities. HQLA may fluctuate from period to period due to normal flows from client activity. &nbsp;The following table presents the estimated HQLA broken out by HQLA-eligible cash and HQLA-eligible securities as of June 30, 2013. Additional available liquidity resourcesIn addition to HQLA, as of June 30, 2013, the Firm has approximately $278 billion unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities available to raise liquidity, if required. Furthermore, the Firm maintains borrowing capacity at various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. As of June 30, 2013, the Firm's borrowing capacity at various FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window was approximately $94 billion, excluding the benefit from securities pledged which have been included above in HQLA eligible securities and other unencumbered securities.Credit ratingsThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm's access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firm's funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see Special-purpose entities on page 55, and Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note&#160;5 on pages 131&#8211;142, of this Form 10-Q.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.70The credit ratings of the parent holding company and certain of the Firm's significant operating subsidiaries as of June 30, 2013, were as follows.On June 11, 2013, S&P announced a reassessment of its government support assumptions reflected in the holding company ratings of eight systemically important financial institutions (&#8220;SIFIs&#8221;), including the Firm. As a result of this reassessment, the outlook for the parent company was revised to negative from stable; the outlook for the Firm's operating subsidiaries remained unchanged at stable. Moody's is undertaking a similar reassessment as a result of which Moody's outlook on the Firm's parent company ratings remains negative.Downgrades of the Firm's long-term ratings by one notch or two notches could result in a downgrade of the Firm's short-term ratings. If this were to occur, the Firm believes its cost of funds could increase and access to certain funding markets could be reduced. The nature and magnitude of the impact of further ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors (which the Firm believes are incorporated in the its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics). The Firm believes it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to further ratings downgrades.JPMorgan Chase's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.Rating agencies continue to evaluate various ratings factors, such as regulatory reforms, rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support, and economic uncertainty and sovereign creditworthiness, and their potential impact on ratings of financial institutions. Although the Firm closely monitors and endeavors to manage factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that its credit ratings will not be changed in the future.&nbsp;Cash flowsAs of June 30, 2013 and 2012, cash and due from banks was $29.2 billion&#32;and $44.9 billion, respectively. These balances decreased by $24.5 billion&#32;and $14.7 billion&#32;from December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected JPMorgan Chase's cash flows during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.Cash flows from operating activitiesJPMorgan Chase's operating assets and liabilities support the Firm's capital markets and lending activities, including the origination or purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale. Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities, and market conditions. Management believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and the Firm's ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Firm's operating liquidity needs.For the six months ended June 30, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $88.5 billion.&#32;This resulted from a decrease in trading assets - debt and equity instruments driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB; a decline in trading assets - derivative receivables due to reductions in interest rate derivative receivables, partly offset by an increase in equity derivative receivables; and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities predominantly due to higher CIB brokerage payables, and the timing of merchant payables payments related to CCB's Card business. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than net income, partially as a result of adjustments for noncash items such as deferred tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Cash proceeds received from sales and paydowns of loans originated and purchased with an initial intent to sell was higher than the cash used to acquire such loans, and also reflected higher levels of activities over the prior-year period. Additionally, trading liabilities - debt and equity instruments increased which was partly offset by a decrease in trading liabilities - derivative payables primarily due to reductions in interest rate derivative payables. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds was an increase in accounts receivables due to higher brokerage receivables and margin loan balances driven by client activity, primarily in CIB, and the timing of 71merchant receivables payments related to CCB's Card business.For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $46.2 billion. This resulted from a decrease in trading assets&#8211;debt and equity instruments driven by lower levels of equity and corporate debt securities, and physical commodities, partially offset by an increase in U.S. government securities; and a decrease in derivative receivables, primarily due to foreign exchange and credit products, partially offset by increased equity derivative balances. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than net income, partially as a result of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and the provision for credit losses. Additionally, cash proceeds received from sales and paydowns of loans was higher than the cash used to acquire such loans originated and purchased with an initial intent to sell. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds was an increase in accrued interest and accounts receivables predominantly due to higher receivables from securities transactions pending settlement, and an increase in CIB customer margin receivables due to changes in client activity.Cash flows from investing activitiesThe Firm's investing activities predominantly include loans originated to be held for investment, the AFS securities portfolio and other short-term interest-earning assets. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, net cash of $142.2&#160;billion&#32;was used in investing activities. This resulted from a significant increase in deposits with banks reflecting the placement of the Firm's excess funds with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve banks. Partially offsetting this cash outflow were a decline in securities purchased under resale agreements due primarily to a shift in deployment of the Firm's excess cash by Treasury; a decrease in loan balances as a result of cash proceeds from sales and securitizations, lower credit card loans due to seasonality and higher repayment rates, and lower consumer excluding credit card loans, predominantly due to mortgage-related paydowns and portfolio run-off; and proceeds from maturities and sales that were higher than the cash used to acquire new AFS securities.For the six months ended June&#160;30, 2012, net cash of $66.0 billion was used in investing activities. This resulted from a significant increase in deposits with banks reflecting&#32;the placement of the Firm's excess funds with various central banks, including Federal Reserve Banks; an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements due to the deployment of excess cash by Treasury; and an increase in loans due to a higher level of wholesale loans driven by increased client activity across all regions and most businesses. Partially offsetting these cash outflows were a decrease in securities, largely due to paydowns and maturities, as well as repositioning of the AFS portfolio; and a decline in the level of consumer, excluding credit card, loans due to paydowns and portfolio run-off, and credit card loans due to seasonality and higher repayment rates.&nbsp;Cash flows from financing activitiesThe Firm's financing activities predominantly include taking customer deposits, and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and common stock. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $30.1 billion. This was driven by net issuances of long-term borrowings; an increase in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements predominantly due to higher secured financing of the Firm's assets and higher client financing activity; and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. Partially offsetting these cash inflows were repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends on common and preferred stock.For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was $4.9 billion. This was driven by securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements predominantly in CIB, reflecting higher client financing activity and a change in the mix of liabilities. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds were a decrease in deposits, predominantly due to a decline in client balances in the wholesale businesses, particularly in CIB and CB, partially offset by an overall growth in retail deposits; net redemptions and maturities of long-term borrowings; and payments of cash dividends on common and preferred stock and repurchases of common stock and warrants.72The following tables present JPMorgan Chase's credit portfolio as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. Total credit exposure was $1.9 trillion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, an increase of $2.8 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, reflecting an increase in the wholesale portfolio of $9.5 billion, largely offset by a decrease in the consumer portfolio of $6.7 billion. For further information on the changes in the credit portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 74&#8211;83, and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 84&#8211;91, of this Form 10-Q.In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale (which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue); and certain loans accounted for at fair value. In addition, the Firm records certain loans accounted for at fair value in trading assets. For further information regarding these loans see Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q. For additional information on the Firm's loans and derivative receivables, including the Firm's accounting policies, see Note 13 and Note 5 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;and 131&#8211;142, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.For further discussion of the Firm's Credit Risk Management framework, see pages 134&#8211;135 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.For further information regarding the credit risk inherent in the Firm's investment securities portfolio, see Note 11 on pages 147&#8211;150&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;and Note 12 on pages 244&#8211;248 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;73JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, business banking loans, and student loans. The Firm's primary focus is on serving the prime segment of the consumer credit market. For further information on consumer loans, see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.A substantial portion of the consumer loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction were identified as PCI based on an analysis of high-risk characteristics, including product type, loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios, FICO risk scores and delinquency status. These PCI loans are accounted for on a pool basis, and the pools are considered to be performing. For further information on PCI loans see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.&nbsp;The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to improve as the economy continues to slowly expand and home prices improved in the first half of the year. Early-stage residential real estate delinquencies (30&#8211;89 days delinquent), excluding government guaranteed loans, decreased during the first half of the year and late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) continued to decline but remain elevated. The elevated level of the late-stage delinquent loans is due, in part, to loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Losses related to these loans continue to be recognized in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off practices, but some delinquent loans that would otherwise have been foreclosed upon remain in the mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.74The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the credit portfolio held by CCB as well as for prime mortgage loans reported in the Asset Management and the Corporate/Private Equity segments for the dates indicated. For further information about the Firm's nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies, see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.75Consumer, excluding credit cardPortfolio analysisConsumer loan balances declined during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, due to paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans, partially offset by new prime mortgage and auto loan originations. Credit performance has improved across most portfolios but residential real estate charge-offs and delinquent loans remain above normal historical levels.The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-related categories. PCI loans are generally excluded from individual loan product discussions and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm's consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Home equity:&#32;The home equity portfolio at June&#160;30, 2013, was $62.3 billion, compared with $67.4 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease in this portfolio primarily reflected loan paydowns and charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies showed improvement from December&#160;31, 2012, while late stage-delinquencies were flat due, in part, to loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Both senior and junior lien nonaccrual loans decreased from December&#160;31, 2012. Net charge-offs for both senior and junior lien home equity loans declined when compared with the same period of the prior year, as a result of improvement in delinquencies and home prices.Approximately 20%&#32;of the Firm's home equity portfolio consists of home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) and the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3&#8211;30 years. Approximately half of the HELOANs are senior liens and the remainder are junior liens. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC recasts into a fully-amortizing variable-rate loan with a 20-year amortization period. At the time of origination, the borrower typically selects one of two minimum payment options that will generally remain in effect during the revolving period: a monthly payment of 1% of the outstanding balance, or interest-only payments based on a variable index (typically prime). HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan's term.Of the approximately $54 billion&#32;unpaid principal balance of non-PCI HELOCs outstanding at June&#160;30, 2013, approximately $39 billion&#32;are fully amortizing, currently possess an ability to refinance, are interest-only balloon loans, or are expected to paydown or charge-off prior to recasting. The remaining $15 billion&#32;represents borrowers who do not currently possess the ability to refinance, and &nbsp;are expected to experience a recast in future periods. These recasts will primarily occur from 2015 through 2017, at which time the borrower must begin to make fully-amortizing payments. The Firm has considered this payment recast risk in its allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated amount of payment shock (i.e., the excess of the fully-amortizing payment over the interest-only payment in effect prior to recast) expected to occur at the payment recast date, along with corresponding estimated probability of default and loss severity assumptions. Certain factors, such as future developments in both unemployment and home prices, could have a significant impact on the expected and/or actual performance of these loans.The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile or when the collateral does not support the loan amount. The Firm will continue to evaluate both the near-term and longer-term repricing and recast risks inherent in its HELOC portfolio to ensure that changes in the Firm's estimate of incurred losses are appropriately considered in the allowance for credit losses and that the Firm's account management practices are appropriate given the portfolio's risk profile.At June&#160;30, 2013, the Firm estimated that its home equity portfolio contained approximately $2.7 billion&#32;of current junior lien loans where the borrower has a first mortgage loan that is either delinquent or has been modified (&#8220;high-risk seconds&#8221;), compared with $3.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than that of junior lien loans for which the senior lien is neither delinquent nor modified. The Firm estimates the balance of its total exposure to high-risk seconds on a quarterly basis using internal data, loan level credit bureau data, which typically provides the delinquency status of the senior lien, as well as information from a database maintained by one of the bank regulatory agencies. The estimated balance of these high-risk seconds may vary from quarter-to-quarter for reasons such as the movement of related senior liens into and out of the 30+ days past due delinquency bucket.76Of the estimated $2.7 billion&#32;of high-risk junior liens at June&#160;30, 2013, the Firm owns approximately 5%&#32;and services approximately 30%&#32;of the related senior lien loans to the same borrowers. The performance of the Firm's junior lien loans is generally consistent regardless of whether the Firm owns, services or does not own or service the senior lien. The increased probability of default associated with these higher-risk junior lien loans was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.Mortgage:&#32;Mortgage loans at June&#160;30, 2013, including prime, subprime and loans held-for-sale, were $87.6 billion, compared with $84.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The mortgage portfolio increased during the quarter as retained prime mortgage originations outpaced paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs decreased from the same period of the prior year, reflecting continued home price improvement and favorable delinquency trends. However, delinquency levels remain elevated compared with historical levels.Prime mortgages, including option adjustable-rate mortgages (&#8220;ARMs&#8221;) and loans held-for-sale, were $79.9 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with $76.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. These loans increased as prime mortgage retained originations exceeded charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans, paydowns, and portfolio run-off of option ARM loans. Excluding loans insured by U.S. government agencies, both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies showed improvement during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013. Nonaccrual loans improved compared with the prior year but remain elevated as a result of ongoing foreclosure processing delays. Net charge-offs continued to improve, as a result of improvement in delinquencies and home prices.At June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm's prime mortgage portfolio included $15.0 billion and $16.0 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans with balloon payments due at the end of the term, which represented 19% and 21% of the prime mortgage portfolio, respectively. These loans are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The decrease in this portfolio was primarily due to voluntary prepayments, as borrowers are generally refinancing into lower rate products. To date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader prime mortgage portfolio and the Firm's expectations. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans.Option ARM loans, which are included in the prime mortgage portfolio, were $6.0 billion&#32;and $6.5 billion&#32;and represented 8%&#32;and 9%&#32;of the prime mortgage portfolio at June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The decrease in option ARM loans resulted from portfolio run-off. As of June&#160;30, 2013, approximately 5%&#32;of option ARM borrowers were delinquent, 1%&#32;were making interest-only or negatively amortizing payments, and 94%&#32;were making amortizing payments (such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing). Approximately 84%&#32;of borrowers within &nbsp;the portfolio are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast, as only a limited number of these loans have been modified. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance due to negative amortization of option ARMs was not material at either June&#160;30, 2013, or December&#160;31, 2012. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM loans will undergo a payment recast that results in a payment increase: $301 million&#32;in 2013, $513 million&#32;in 2014&#32;and $646 million&#32;in 2015. Default rates generally increase when payment recast results in a payment increase. However, as the Firm's option ARM loans, other than those held in the PCI portfolio, are primarily loans with lower LTV ratios and higher borrower FICO scores, it is possible that many of these borrowers will be able to refinance into a lower rate product, which would reduce this payment recast risk. Accordingly, the Firm expects substantially lower losses on this portfolio when compared with the PCI option ARM portfolio. To date, losses realized on option ARM loans that have undergone payment recast have been immaterial and consistent with the Firm's expectations. The option ARM portfolio was acquired by the Firm as part of the Washington Mutual transaction.Subprime mortgages at June&#160;30, 2013, were $7.7 billion, compared with $8.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease was due to portfolio run-off and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Early-stage and late-stage delinquencies as well as nonaccrual loans have improved from December&#160;31, 2012, but remain at elevated levels. Net charge-offs decreased from the prior year.Auto:&#32;Auto loans at June&#160;30, 2013, were $50.9 billion, compared with $49.9 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Loan balances increased due to new originations, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs. Delinquent and nonaccrual loans improved compared with December&#160;31, 2012. Net charge-offs increased from the prior year, but loss levels are considered low as a result of favorable trends in both loss frequency and loss severity, mainly due to enhanced underwriting standards and a strong used car market. The auto loan portfolio reflected a high concentration of prime-quality credits.Business banking: Business banking loans at June&#160;30, 2013, decreased to $18.7 billion&#32;from $18.9 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, as new originations were lower than paydowns and charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans improved compared with December&#160;31, 2012, and net charge-offs declined from the prior year due to favorable trends in the credit environment.Student and other: Student and other loans at June&#160;30, 2013, were $11.8 billion, compared with $12.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs of student loans. Other loans primarily include other secured and unsecured consumer loans. Nonaccrual loans increased from December&#160;31, 2012, while net charge-offs decreased from the prior year.77Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans at June&#160;30, 2013, were $56.7 billion, compared with $59.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. This portfolio represents loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction, which were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. PCI HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan's term. Substantially all undrawn HELOCs within the revolving period have been blocked.During the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, no change in impairment was recognized in connection with the Firm's review of the PCI portfolios' expected cash flows. At both June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the allowance for loan losses for the home equity, prime mortgage, option ARM and subprime mortgage PCI portfolios was $1.9&#160;billion, $1.9&#160;billion, $1.5 billion&#32;and $380 million, respectively.As of June&#160;30, 2013, approximately 24% of the Option ARM PCI loans were delinquent. Approximately 67% of the loans in the portfolio that are not delinquent have been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans and 33% are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans are subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast.Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm's quarterly estimates of expected cash flows for the PCI portfolio. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option ARM PCI pool was $812 million&#32;and $879 million&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM PCI loans will undergo a payment recast that results in a payment increase: $77&#160;million&#32;in 2013, $392 million&#32;in 2014, and $788&#160;million&#32;in 2015.The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in either the nonaccretable difference or the allowance for loan losses. Lifetime principal&#32;loss estimates were relatively unchanged from December&#160;31, 2012, to June&#160;30, 2013. Principal charge-offs will not be recorded on these pools until the nonaccretable difference has been fully depleted.&nbsp;Geographic composition of residential real estate loansAt both June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, California had the greatest concentration of residential real estate loans with 24%&#32;of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans. Of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, $74.4 billion, or 55%, were concentrated in California, New York, Arizona, Florida and Michigan at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with $74.1 billion, or 54%, at December&#160;31, 2012. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans concentrated in these five states represented 72%&#32;of total PCI loans at both June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.Current estimated LTVs of residential real estate loansThe current estimated average LTV ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, was 76%&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with 81%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, 14%&#32;of the retained portfolio had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 4%&#32;of the retained portfolio had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 125% at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with 20%&#32;and 8%, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2012. Although home prices have begun to recover, the decline in home prices from 2007 has had a significant impact on the collateral values underlying the Firm's residential real estate loan portfolio. In general, the delinquency rate for loans with high LTV ratios is greater than the delinquency rate for loans in which the borrower has equity in the collateral. While a large portion of the loans with current estimated LTV ratios greater than 100% continue to pay and are current, the continued willingness and ability of these borrowers to pay remains a risk.78The following table presents the current estimated LTV ratios, as well as the ratios of the carrying value of the underlying loans to the current estimated collateral value, with respect to the Firm's PCI loans. Because such loans were initially measured at fair value, the ratios of the carrying value to the current estimated collateral value will be lower than the current estimated LTV ratios, which are based on the unpaid principal balances. The estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.The current estimated average LTV ratios were 98%&#32;and 114%&#32;for California and Florida PCI loans, respectively, at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with 110%&#32;and 125%, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2012. Average LTV ratios have declined consistent with recent improvement in home prices. Although prices have improved, home prices in California and Florida are still lower than at the peak of the housing market, which continues to negatively contribute to current estimated average LTV ratios and the ratio of net carrying value to current estimated collateral value for loans in the PCI portfolio. Of the PCI portfolio, 40%&#32;had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 14%&#32;had a current LTV ratio of greater than 125% at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with 55%&#32;and 24%, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2012.While the current estimated collateral value is greater than the net carrying value of PCI loans, the ultimate performance of this portfolio is highly dependent on borrowers' behavior and ongoing ability and willingness to continue to make payments on homes with negative equity, as well as on the cost of alternative housing. For further information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of residential real estate &#8211; non-PCI and PCI loans, see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Loan modification activities &#8211; residential real estate loansFor both the Firm's on&#8211;balance sheet loans and loans serviced for others, nearly 1.5 million&#32;mortgage modifications have been offered to borrowers and approximately 684,000&#32;have been approved since the beginning of 2009. Of these, approximately 673,000&#32;have achieved permanent modification as of June&#160;30, 2013. Of the remaining modifications offered, 12%&#32;are in a trial period or still being reviewed for a modification, while 88%&#32;&nbsp;have dropped out of the modification program or otherwise were deemed not eligible for final modification.The Firm is participating in the U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;) programs and is continuing to offer its other loss-mitigation programs to financially distressed borrowers who do not qualify for the U.S. Treasury's programs. The MHA programs include the Home Affordable Modification Program (&#8220;HAMP&#8221;) and the Second Lien Modification Program (&#8220;2MP&#8221;). The Firm's other loss-mitigation programs for troubled borrowers who do not qualify for HAMP include the traditional modification programs offered by the GSEs and other governmental agencies, as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, which include concessions similar to those offered under HAMP and 2MP but with expanded eligibility criteria. In addition, the Firm has offered specific targeted modification programs to higher risk borrowers, many of whom were current on their mortgages prior to modification. For further information about how loans are modified, see Note 13, Loan modifications, on pages 160&#8211;167&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Loan modifications under HAMP and under one of the Firm's proprietary modification programs, which is largely modeled after HAMP, require at least three payments to be made under the new terms during a trial modification period, and must be successfully re-underwritten with income verification before the loan can be permanently modified. In the case of specific targeted modification programs, re-underwriting the loan or a trial modification period is generally not required, unless the targeted loan is delinquent at the time of modification. When the Firm modifies home equity lines of credit, future lending 79commitments related to the modified loans are canceled as part of the terms of the modification.The primary indicator used by management to monitor the success of the modification programs is the rate at which the modified loans redefault. Modification redefault rates are affected by a number of factors, including the type of loan modified, the borrower's overall ability and willingness to repay the modified loan and macroeconomic factors. Reduction in payment size for a borrower continues to be the most significant driver in improving redefault rates.The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type and also on whether the underlying loan is in the PCI portfolio, due both to differences in credit quality and in the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 19%&#32;for senior lien home equity, 18%&#32;for junior lien home equity, 14%&#32;for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 24%&#32;for subprime mortgages. The cumulative performance metrics for modifications to the PCI residential real estate portfolio seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 19%&#32;for home equity, 16%&#32;for prime mortgages, 13%&#32;for option ARMs and 28%&#32;for subprime mortgages. The favorable performance of the option ARM modifications is the result of a targeted proactive program which fixes the borrower's payment at the current level. The cumulative redefault rates reflect the performance of modifications completed under both HAMP and the Firm's proprietary modification programs from October 1, 2009, through June&#160;30, 2013.The following table presents information as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, relating to modified on&#8211;balance sheet residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications of PCI loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans, and the impact of the modification is incorporated into the Firm's quarterly assessment of estimated future cash flows. Modifications of consumer loans other than PCI loans are generally accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;). For further information on TDRs for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.&nbsp;80Nonperforming assetsThe following table presents information as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.Nonaccrual loans: Total consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans were $8.6 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with $9.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012.The following table presents changes in the consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012.&nbsp;Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio totaled $7.9 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, of which 39%&#32;were greater than 150 days past due, compared with nonaccrual residential real estate loans of $8.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, of which 42%&#32;were greater than 150 days past due. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 52%&#32;to estimated net realizable value of the collateral at both June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The elongated foreclosure processing timelines are expected to continue to result in elevated levels of nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolios.Real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;): REO assets are managed for prompt sale and disposition at the best possible economic value. REO assets are those individual properties where the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). The Firm generally recognizes REO assets at the completion of the foreclosure process or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure with the borrower. REO assets, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, decreased by $49 million&#32;from $647 million&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, to $598 million&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013.Mortgage servicing-related mattersThe financial crisis resulted in unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of 1-4 family residential real estate loans. Such loans required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. It is the Firm's goal that foreclosure in these situations be a last resort, and accordingly, the Firm has made, and continues to make, significant efforts to help borrowers stay in their homes. Since the third quarter of 2010, the Firm has prevented two foreclosures for every foreclosure completed; foreclosure-prevention methods include loan modification, short sales and other means.The Firm has a well-defined foreclosure prevention process when a borrower fails to pay on his or her loan. The Firm attempts to contact the borrower multiple times and in various ways in an effort to pursue home retention or other options other than foreclosure. In addition, if the Firm is unable to contact a borrower, the Firm completes various reviews of the borrower's facts and circumstances before a foreclosure sale is completed. The delinquency period for the average borrower at the time of foreclosure over the last year has been approximately 27&#32;months.The high volume of delinquent and defaulted mortgages experienced by the Firm placed a significant amount of stress on the Firm's servicing operations. The Firm has entered into a global settlement with certain federal and state agencies and Consent Orders with its banking regulators with respect to various mortgage servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure process-related matters as further discussed below. The GSEs also impose compensatory fees on its mortgage servicers, including the Firm, if such servicers are unable to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs. The Firm has 81incurred, and is continuing to incur, compensatory fees, which are reported in default servicing expense. To address its underlying mortgage servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure process issues, the Firm has made significant changes to its mortgage operations, which will enable it to continue working towards complying with the Consent Orders and the global settlement and enhance its ability to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs. On April 22, 2013, the OCC issued guidance regarding the obligation of servicers to track loans scheduled for foreclosure sale within 60 days and to confirm certain information prior to proceeding with the scheduled sale. The Firm is reviewing its practices in response to this guidance.Global settlement with federal and state agencies:&#32;On February 9, 2012, the Firm announced that it had agreed to a settlement in principle (the &#8220;global settlement&#8221;) with a number of federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the State Attorneys General, relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The global settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required the Firm to, among other things: (i) make cash payments of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of which was set aside for payments to borrowers (&#8220;Cash Settlement Payment&#8221;); (ii) provide approximately $500 million&#32;of refinancing relief to certain &#8220;underwater&#8221; borrowers whose loans are owned and serviced by the Firm (&#8220;Refi Program&#8221;); and (iii) provide approximately $3.7 billion&#32;of additional relief for certain borrowers, including reductions of principal on first and second liens, payments to assist with short sales, deficiency balance waivers on past foreclosures and short sales, and forbearance assistance for unemployed homeowners (&#8220;Consumer Relief Program&#8221;).The Cash Settlement Payment was made on April 13, 2012 and the Firm began to provide relief to borrowers under the Refi Program and the Consumer Relief Program in the first quarter of 2012. All refinancings required under the Refi Program were completed as of December 31, 2012, and the obligations under the Consumer Relief Program were completed in the first half of 2013. Satisfaction of the Consumer Relief Program and the Refi Program requirements under the global settlement is subject to certification by the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight (&#8220;OMSO&#8221;).The global settlement also requires the Firm to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards. The servicing standards include, among other items, the following enhancements to the Firm's servicing of loans: a pre-foreclosure notice to all borrowers, which will include account information, holder status, and loss mitigation steps taken; enhancements to payment application and collections processes; strengthening procedures for filings in bankruptcy proceedings; deploying specific restrictions &nbsp;on the &#8220;dual track&#8221; of foreclosure and loss mitigation; standardizing the process for appeal of loss mitigation denials; and implementing certain restrictions on fees, including the waiver of certain fees while a borrower's loss mitigation application is being evaluated. All of the prescribed servicing standards were implemented within the required timeframes and compliance with the standards is subject to both continuous internal review and review by the OMSO. The Firm's performance under the National Mortgage Settlement is detailed in the OMSO Report which was published on June 19, 2013 and filed with the D.C. District Court. Compliance with the servicing standards continues to be tested and the results will continue to be reported quarterly to the OMSO through the expiration of the settlement. The Firm expects to file its next quarterly report concerning its compliance with the global settlement with the OMSO in August 2013.Consent Orders: During the second quarter of 2011, the Firm entered into Consent Orders (&#8220;Orders&#8221;) with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. In the Orders, the regulators have mandated significant changes to the Firm's servicing and default business and outlined requirements to implement these changes. The Firm submitted comprehensive action plans to the regulators, which set&#32;forth the steps necessary to ensure the Firm's residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Orders. The plans were approved and the Firm has implemented a number of corrective actions and made significant progress with respect to the following:82In addition, pursuant to the Orders, the Firm is required to enhance oversight of its mortgage servicing activities, including oversight by compliance, management and audit personnel and, accordingly, has made and continues to make changes in its organization structure, control oversight and customer service practices.Pursuant to the Orders, the Firm had retained an independent consultant to conduct a review of its residential foreclosure actions during the period from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2010 (including foreclosure actions brought in respect of loans being serviced), and to remediate any errors or deficiencies identified by the independent consultant. On January 7, 2013, the Firm announced that it and a number of other financial institutions had entered into a settlement agreement with the OCC and the Federal Reserve providing for the termination of such Independent Foreclosure Review programs. On February 28, 2013, the Firm entered into an Amended Consent Order with the regulators reflecting the settlement of the Independent Foreclosure Review. As a result of this settlement, the independent consultant is no longer conducting a look-back review of residential foreclosure actions. The Firm has made total cash payments of approximately $760 million&#32;into a settlement fund for distribution to qualified borrowers. The Firm has also committed an additional $1.2 billion&#32;to foreclosure prevention actions, which will be fulfilled through credits given to the Firm for modifications, short sales and other specified types of borrower relief. Foreclosure prevention actions that earn credit under the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement are in addition to actions taken by the Firm to earn credit under the Consumer Relief Program of the global settlement. The estimated impact of the foreclosure prevention actions required under the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement has been considered in the Firm's allowance for loan losses. The Firm recognized a pretax charge of approximately $700 million&#32;in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement. For additional information on Mortgage servicing-related matters, see pages 146&#8211;148 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Credit CardTotal credit card loans were $124.3 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, a decrease of $3.7 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, due to seasonality and higher repayment rates.The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 1.69%&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, from 2.10%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. For the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, the net charge-off rates were 3.31%&#32;and 4.35%, respectively. For the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, the net charge-off rates were 3.43%&#32;and 4.37%, respectively. Charge-offs have improved compared with a year ago as a result of continued improvement in delinquent loans. The credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned, largely rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S. geographic diversification. The greatest geographic concentration of credit card loans is in California, which represented 13%&#32;of total retained loans at both June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. Loan concentration for the top five states of California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois consisted of $51.1 billion&#32;in receivables, or 41%&#32;of the retained loan portfolio, at June&#160;30, 2013, compared with $52.3 billion, or 41%, at December&#160;31, 2012.Modifications of credit card loansAt June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm had $3.9 billion&#32;and $4.8 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. The decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from December&#160;31, 2012, was attributable to a reduction in new modifications as well as ongoing payments and charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans.Consistent with the Firm's policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged-off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income.For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 74&#8211;83&#32;and Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.83As of June&#160;30, 2013, wholesale exposure (CIB, CB, and AM) continued to experience a favorable credit environment and stable credit trend with low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Wholesale exposure increased by $9.5 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, primarily driven by an increase of $10.7 billion&#32;in lending-related commitments due to increased client activity in the CIB and CB. This increase was partially offset by a $1.2&#160;billion&#32;decrease in derivative receivables. Derivative receivables decreased primarily due to reductions in interest rate derivative receivables driven by an increase in interest rates. Decreases were partially offset by an increase in equity derivative receivables driven by a rise in equity markets.&nbsp;84The following tables present summaries of the maturity and ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. The ratings scale is based on the Firm's internal risk ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's.Wholesale credit exposure &#8211; selected industry exposuresThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, paying particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which consist &nbsp;of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, decreased by 12%&#32;to $13.8 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, from $15.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, primarily due to repayments and sales.85Below are summaries of the top 25 industry exposures as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.8687The following tables present the geographic distribution of wholesale credit exposure including nonperforming assets and past due loans as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. The geographic distribution of the wholesale portfolio in the table below is determined based predominantly on the domicile (legal residence) of the borrower. For further information on Country Risk Management, see pages 100&#8211;102&#32;of this Form 10-Q.88LoansIn the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators, see Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The Firm actively manages its wholesale credit exposure. One way of managing credit risk is through secondary market sales of loans and lending-related commitments. During the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm sold $8.3 billion&#32;and $2.0 billion, respectively, of loans and lending-related commitments. The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012. Nonaccrual wholesale loans decreased by $388 million&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, largely reflecting paydowns.The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans.&nbsp;Receivables from customersReceivables from customers primarily represent margin loans to prime and retail brokerage clients that are collateralized through a pledge of assets maintained in clients' brokerage accounts that are subject to daily minimum collateral requirements. In the event that the collateral value decreases, a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account. If additional collateral is not provided by the client, the client's position may be liquidated by the Firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements.Lending-related commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including Revolving Credit Facilities) and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of these contracts.In the Firm's view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm's actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments, the Firm has established a &#8220;loan-equivalent&#8221; amount for each commitment; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor. The loan-equivalent amount of the Firm's lending-related commitments was $222.4&#160;billion&#32;and $223.7 billion&#32;as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively.89Derivative contractsIn the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. Derivatives enable customers and the Firm to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit exposure. For further discussion of derivative contracts, see Note 5 on pages 131&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.Derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $73.8 billion&#32;and $75.0 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively.&#160;These amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts, including CVA, after giving effect to legally enforceable &nbsp;master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $13.3 billion&#32;and $15.2 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor.In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash; G7 government securities; other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities; and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Though this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative transactions move in the Firm's favor. As of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm held $29.8 billion&#32;and $29.0 billion, respectively, of this additional collateral. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements, see Note 5 on pages 131&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes the ratings profile, by derivative counterparty, of the Firm's derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of other liquid securities collateral, for the dates indicated.As noted above, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm's derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements &#8211; excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity &#8211; was 87%&#32;as of June&#160;30, 2013, largely unchanged compared with 88%&#32;as of&#32;December&#160;31, 2012.&nbsp;Credit derivativesCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller) when the reference entity suffers a credit event. If no credit event has occurred, the protection seller makes no payments to the protection purchaser.90For a more detailed description of credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 on pages 141&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q; and on pages 158&#8211;159 and Note 6 on pages 218&#8211;227 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker; and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm's own credit risk associated with various exposures.Credit portfolio management activitiesIncluded in end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm's wholesale businesses (collectively, &#8220;Credit portfolio management&#8221; activities). Information on Credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. For further information on derivatives used in Credit portfolio management activities, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 on pages 141&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and on pages 158&#8211;159 and Note 6 on pages 218&#8211;227 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.In addition, the Firm uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain AFS securities and from certain securities held in the Firm's market-making businesses. These credit derivatives, as well as the synthetic credit portfolio, are not included in Credit portfolio management activities; for further information on these credit derivatives as well as credit derivatives used in the Firm's capacity as a market-maker in credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 5 on pages 141&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q.&nbsp;The credit derivatives used in Credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in Credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm's view, of the true changes in value of the Firm's overall credit exposure. In addition, the effectiveness of the Firm's credit default swap (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) protection as a hedge of the Firm's exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS), the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm), and the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm's exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm.Credit Portfolio hedgesThe following table sets out the fair value of the Firm's credit derivatives used in Credit portfolio management activities, the fair value related to the CVA (which reflects the credit quality of derivatives counterparty exposure), as well as certain other hedges used in the risk management of CVA. These results can vary from period to period due to market conditions that affect specific positions in the portfolio.91The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. The Firm is a national leader in community development by providing loans, investments and community development services in communities across the United States.At June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm's CRA loan portfolio was approximately $15 billion&#32;and $16&#160;billion, respectively. At June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, 61%&#32;and 62%, respectively, of the &nbsp;CRA portfolio were residential mortgage loans; 19%&#32;and 18%, respectively, were business banking loans; 13%, for both periods, were commercial real estate loans; and 7%, for both periods, were other loans. CRA nonaccrual loans were 4%&#32;of the Firm's total nonaccrual loans for both periods. As a percentage of the Firm's net charge-offs, net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were 1%&#32;and 2%, respectively, for the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, and 2%&#32;and 3%, respectively, for the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012.JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses covers the consumer, including credit card, portfolio segments (primarily scored); and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio. The allowance represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm's loan portfolio. Management also determines an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer, excluding credit card, lending-related commitments.For a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses, including adjustments to statistical loss calculations, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 104&#8211;106&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;and Note 15 on pages 276&#8211;279 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm, and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of June&#160;30, 2013, JPMorgan Chase&#32;deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate (i.e., sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio).The allowance for credit losses was $20.1 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, a decrease of $2.5 billion&#32;from $22.6&#160;billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses was due to a $2.7 billion&#32;reduction, reflecting lower estimated losses due to improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, as well as the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio.&#32;However, relatively high unemployment, uncertainties regarding the ultimate success of loan modifications, and the risk attributes of certain loans within the portfolio (e.g., loans with high LTV ratios, junior lien loans that are subordinate to a delinquent or modified senior lien, HELOCs with future payment recast) continued to contribute to uncertainty regarding the performance of the residential real estate portfolio; these uncertainties were considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.The consumer, excluding credit card, allowance for loan losses decreased $1.6 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, due &nbsp;to a reduction in the allowance for the non-PCI residential real estate portfolio. This decrease was largely due to lower estimated losses in the statistical loss calculation of the formula-based allowance, reflecting improved delinquency trends as well as the impact of improved home prices. The adjustment to the base statistical calculation also declined during the second quarter of 2013, reflecting both the improving trend in home prices and the continuing economic expansion. For additional information about delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 74&#8211;83&#32;and Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The credit card allowance for loan losses decreased by $1.1&#160;billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease included reductions in both the asset-specific and formula-based allowance. The reduction in the asset-specific allowance, which relates to loans restructured in TDRs, largely reflects the changing profile of the TDR portfolio. The volume of new TDRs, which have higher loss rates due to expected redefaults, continues to decrease, and the loss rate on existing TDRs is also decreasing over time as previously restructured loans season and continue to perform. The reduction in the formula-based allowance was primarily driven by the continuing trend of improving delinquencies and bankruptcies, which resulted in a lower level of estimated losses based on the Firm's statistical loss calculation, and by lower levels of credit card outstandings. For additional information about delinquencies in the credit card loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 74&#8211;83&#32;and Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The wholesale allowance was relatively unchanged reflecting stable credit trends.The allowance for lending-related commitments for both the consumer, excluding credit card, and wholesale portfolios, which is reported in other liabilities, was $753 million&#32;and $668 million&#32;at June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively.92The credit ratios in the following table are based on retained loan balances, which exclude loans held-for-sale and loans accounted for at fair value.93Provision for credit lossesFor the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, the provision for credit losses was $47 million&#32;and $664 million, respectively, down 78%&#32;and 29%, respectively, from the prior year periods. The provision for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, included a $1.5 billion&#32;and $2.7 billion&#32;reduction in the allowance for loan losses, reflecting lower estimated losses due to improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, as well as the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio.The decline in the total consumer provision was due to lower net charge-offs offset partially by a smaller reduction &nbsp;in the allowance for loan losses compared with the prior-year periods, reflecting lower estimated losses due to improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, as well as the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio.For the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, the wholesale provision for credit losses was $76 million&#32;and $148 million, respectively, compared with $43 million&#32;and $132 million, respectively, in the prior-year periods. The wholesale provision for credit losses in the current periods reflected stable credit trends.94Market risk is the exposure to an adverse change in the market value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by a change in their market prices. For a discussion of the Firm's market risk management organization, major market risk drivers and classification of risks, see Market Risk Management on pages 163&#8211;169 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report. For a discussion of the Firm's risk monitoring and control and market risk limits, see Limits on page 169 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Market risk managementMarket Risk is an independent risk management function that works in close partnership with the lines of business, including Corporate/Private Equity, to identify and monitor market risks throughout the Firm and to define market risk policies and procedures. The market risk function reports to the Firm's Chief Risk Officer.Market Risk seeks to control risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm's market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk is responsible for the following functions:Risk identification and classificationEach line of business is responsible for the management of the market risks within its units. The independent risk management group responsible for overseeing each line of business ensures that all material market risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk policy framework set out by Market Risk. The Firm's market risks arise primarily from the activities in CIB, Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing in CCB, and CIO in Corporate/Private Equity. For further discussion of the Firm's risk identification and classification, see Market Risk Management on pages 163&#8211;169 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Risk measurementTools used to measure riskBecause no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, the Firm uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, including:&nbsp;Value-at-riskJPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment consistent with the day-to-day risk decisions made by the lines of business.VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology, which approximates a 95% confidence level. This means that, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur losses greater than that predicted by VaR estimates not more than five times in every 100 trading days. For risk management purposes, the Firm believes the use of a 95% confidence level with a one-day holding period provides a stable measure of VaR that closely aligns to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business and provides information to respond to risk events on a daily basis.VaR is not used to estimate the impact of stressed market conditions or to manage any impact from potential stress events. The Firm uses economic-value stress testing and other techniques to capture and manage market risk arising under stressed scenarios, as described further below.Because VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential losses. For example, differences between current and historical market price volatility may result in fewer or greater VaR exceptions than the number indicated by the historical simulation. The VaR measurement also does not provide an estimate of the extent to which losses may occur from stress events not reflected in the historical look-back period. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. As VaR cannot be used to determine future losses in the Firm's market risk positions, the Firm considers other metrics in addition to VaR to monitor and manage its market risk positions. Separately, the Firm calculates a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (&#8220;Regulatory VaR&#8221;), which is used to derive the Firm's regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under the Basel 2.5 Market Risk Rule. For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital (e.g. VaR-based Measure, Stressed VaR-based Measure and the respective backtesting) for the Firm, see JPMorgan Chase's &#8220;Regulatory Capital Disclosures - Market Risk Pillar 3 Report&#8221; which can be found on the Firm's website at http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm, and see Capital management on pages 60&#8211;64&#32;of this Form 10-Q.95The table below shows the results of the Firm's VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.VaR measurementCIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm uses alternative methods to capture and measure those risk parameters that are not otherwise captured in VaR, including economic-value stress testing, nonstatistical measures and risk identification for large exposures as described further below.&nbsp;Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. Credit portfolio VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.Other VaR includes certain positions employed as part of the Firm's risk management function within CIO and in the Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing businesses. CIO VaR includes positions, primarily in securities and derivatives, which are measured at fair value through earnings. Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing VaR includes the Firm's mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs and all related hedges.96As noted above, CIB, Credit portfolio and other VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value; however, it does include hedges of those positions, which are reported at fair value. It also does not include DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities to reflect the credit quality of the Firm; principal investments; and investment securities managed by CIO that are classified as available for sale. These positions are primarily managed through the Firm's nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk and other cash flow-monitoring processes, rather than by using a VaR measure. Principal investing activities (including mezzanine financing, tax-oriented investments, etc.) and private equity positions are managed using stress and scenario analyses and are not included in VaR. See the DVA sensitivity table on page 99&#32;of this Form 10-Q for further details. For a discussion of Corporate/Private Equity, see pages 49&#8211;51&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The Firm's VaR model calculations are continuously evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's modeling techniques and other factors. Such changes will also affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Model changes go through a review and approval process by the Model Review Group prior to implementation into the operating environment. For further information, see Model risk on pages 125&#8211;126 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.As presented in the table above, average Total VaR decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, when compared with the respective 2012 periods. These decreases were primarily driven by reduced risk in the synthetic credit portfolio and lower market volatility.Average total CIB trading and Credit portfolio VaR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, decreased compared with the respective 2012 periods. These decreases were primarily driven by lower market volatility across multiple asset classes.During the third quarter of 2012, the Firm applied a new VaR model to calculate VaR for CIO's synthetic credit portfolio that had been transferred to the CIB on July 2, 2012. (For further information, see Market Risk Management on page 166 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.) In the first quarter of 2013, in order to achieve consistency among like products within CIB and in conjunction with the implementation of Basel 2.5 requirements, the Firm moved CIO's synthetic credit portfolio to an existing VaR model within the CIB. This change had an insignificant impact to the average fixed income VaR and average total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR, and it had no impact to the average total VaR compared with the model used in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. When compared with the model used prior to the model change in the third quarter of 2012, this &nbsp;VaR model resulted in a reduction of approximately $8 million to average fixed income VaR, average total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR, and average total VaR, for the three months ended June 30, 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, this VaR model resulted in a reduction of $10 million to average fixed income VaR, $9 million to average total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR, and $8 million to average total VaR.Average CIO VaR for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, decreased from the comparable 2012 period, predominantly reflecting the reduction in and transfer of risk from CIO's synthetic credit portfolio to the CIB on July 2, 2012. CIO's retained portfolio was effectively closed out during the three months ended September 30, 2012.Average Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2013, did not significantly change from the comparable 2012 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, average Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing VaR increased from the comparable 2012 period, primarily driven by a reduction in diversification benefit across these businesses.The Firm's average Total VaR diversification benefit was $10 million or 18% of the sum for the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared with $56 million or 22% of the sum for the comparable 2012 period. The Firm's average Total VaR diversification benefit was $10 million or 14% of the sum for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared with $51 million or 22% of the sum for the comparable 2012 period. In general, over the course of the year, VaR exposure can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change.VaR back-testingThe Firm conducts daily back-testing of VaR against its market risk-related revenue.The following histogram illustrates the daily market risk-related gains and losses for positions included in the Firm's VaR calculation for the six months ended&#32;June 30, 2013. This market risk-related revenue is defined as the change in value of: principal transactions revenue for CIB and CIO; trading-related net interest income for CIB, CIO and Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing in CCB; CIB brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue; revenue from syndicated lending facilities that the Firm intends to distribute; and mortgage fees and related income for the Firm's mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs, and all related hedges. Daily firmwide market risk-related revenue excludes gains and losses from DVA.The chart shows that for six months ended&#32;June 30, 2013, the Firm posted market risk-related gains on each of the 128 days in this period with two days exceeding $200 million; there were no loss days in the six months ended&#32;June 30, 2013.97Other risk measuresEconomic-value stress testingAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool in measuring and controlling risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior as an indicator of losses, stress testing is intended to capture the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. The Firm runs weekly stress tests on market-related risks across the lines of business using multiple scenarios that assume significant changes in risk factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates or commodity prices. The framework uses a grid-based approach, which calculates multiple magnitudes of stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs for each risk factor. Stress-test results, trends and explanations based on current market risk positions are reported to the Firm's senior management and to the lines of business to allow them to better understand the sensitivity of positions to certain defined events and manage their risks with more transparency.Stress scenarios are defined and reviewed by Market Risk, and significant changes are reviewed by the relevant Risk Committees, (For further details see Risk Governance, on pages 123&#8211;125 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report). &nbsp;While most of these scenarios estimate losses based on significant market moves, such as an equity market collapse or credit crisis, the Firm also develops scenarios to quantify risk coming from specific portfolios or concentrations of risks, which attempt to capture certain idiosyncratic market movements. Scenarios may be redefined on an ongoing basis to reflect current market conditions. Ad hoc scenarios are run in response to specific market events or concerns. Furthermore, the Firm's stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results under scenarios mandated by the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;) and ICAAP (&#8220;Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process&#8221;) processes.Nonstatistical risk measuresNonstatistical risk measures include sensitivities to variables used to value positions, such as credit spread sensitivities, interest rate basis point values and market values. These measures provide granular information on the Firm's market risk exposure. They are aggregated by line-of-business and by risk type, and are used for tactical control and monitoring limits.98Loss advisories and profit and loss drawdownsLoss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns are tools used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. Profit and loss drawdowns are defined as the decline in net profit and loss since the year-to-date peak revenue level.Risk identification for large exposuresIndividuals who manage risk positions consider potential material losses that could arise from specific, unusual events, such as a potential change in tax legislation, or a particular combination of unusual market moves. This information allows the Firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not adequately covered by standard risk measures.Nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk (i.e., &#8220;earnings-at-risk&#8221;)Interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. The Firm's Asset-Liability Committee ("ALCO") establishes the Firm's interest rate risk policies and sets risk guidelines applied to nontrading positions. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the lines of business, calculates the Firm's nontrading interest rate risk profile weekly and reviews it with senior management. For further discussion on interest rate exposure, see Nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue-at-risk (i.e., &#8220;earnings-at-risk&#8221;) on pages 168&#8211;169 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The Firm conducts simulations of changes in nontrading interest rate-sensitive revenue under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this revenue, and the corresponding impact to the Firm's pretax net interest income, over the following 12 months, utilizing multiple assumptions as described below. These scenarios highlight exposures to various interest rate-sensitive factors, such as the rates themselves (e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, such as asset sales and securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on current interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience and forward market expectations. The amount and pricing assumptions of deposits and other products that have no stated maturity are based on historical performance, the competitive environment, customer behavior, and product mix.Immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk, and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed. These scenarios include the implied forward curve, nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates. These scenarios are intended &nbsp;to provide a comprehensive view of JPMorgan Chase's earnings-at-risk over a wide range of outcomes.The change in earnings-at-risk from December&#160;31, 2012, resulted from repositioning the AFS securities portfolio, partially offset by higher expected deposit balances. The Firm's benefit to rising rates is largely a result of reinvesting at higher yields and assets re-pricing at a faster pace than deposits.Additionally, another interest rate scenario used by the Firm &#8212; involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels &#8212; results in a 12-month pretax net interest income benefit of $890 million. The increase in net interest income under this scenario is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.Debit valuation adjustment sensitivityThe following table provides information about the gross sensitivity of DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities to a one-basis-point increase in JPMorgan Chase's credit spreads. This sensitivity represents the impact from a one-basis-point parallel shift in JPMorgan Chase's entire credit curve. However, the sensitivity at a single point in time multiplied by the change in credit spread at a single maturity point may not be representative of the actual DVA gain or loss realized within a period. Actual results reflect the movement in credit spreads across various maturities, which typically do not move in a parallel fashion, and are the product of a constantly changing exposure profile, among other factors.99For a discussion of the Firm's Country Risk Management organization, and country risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control, see pages 170&#8211;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The Firm is exposed to country risk primarily through its wholesale lending, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm's internal country risk management approach, country exposure is reported based on the country where the majority of the assets of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor are located or where the majority of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (legal residence) of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor. Country exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm's risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain tranched credit derivatives. Different measurement approaches or assumptions would affect the amount of reported country exposure.The Firm's internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under FFIEC bank regulatory requirements as there are significant differences in reporting methodology, including with respect to the treatment of collateral received and the benefit of credit derivative protection. For further information on the FFIEC's reporting methodology, see Cross-border outstandings on page 347 of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Form 10-K.The following table presents the Firm's top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.). The selection of countries is based solely on the Firm's largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm's internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm's view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions.&nbsp;Selected European exposureThe Firm has monitored its exposures in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Greece closely since the Eurozone debt crisis began and believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the Firm's aggregate exposures. The Firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and, therefore, the Firm's aggregate net exposures and sector distribution may vary over time. In addition, the net exposures may be affected by changes in market conditions, including the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations.100The following table presents the Firm's direct exposure at June&#160;30, 2013, to Spain, Italy, Ireland Portugal and Greece, as measured under the Firm's internal country risk management approach. For individual exposures, corporate clients represent approximately 86%&#32;of the Firm's non-sovereign exposure in these five countries, and substantially all of the remaining 14%&#32;of the non-sovereign exposure is to the banking sector.101Effect of credit derivatives on selected European exposuresCountry exposures in the Selected European exposure table above have been reduced by purchasing protection through single name, index, and tranched credit derivatives. The following table presents the effect of purchased and sold credit derivatives on the trading and portfolio hedging activities in the Selected European exposure table.See pages 170&#8211;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report&#32;for information regarding the measurement of credit derivatives under the Firm's internal country risk management approach.The credit derivatives reflected in the &#8220;Trading&#8221; column include those from the Firm's market-making activities; net protection from credit derivatives was de minimus at June&#160;30, 2013, primarily as a result of maturities in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by CIB beginning in July 2012.The credit derivatives reflected in the &#8220;Portfolio hedging&#8221; column are predominantly single-name CDS used in the Firm's Credit portfolio management activities, which are intended to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities and derivative counterparty exposure. The effectiveness of the Firm's CDS protection as a hedge of the firm's exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection, the named reference entity, and the contractual terms of the CDS. For further information about credit derivatives see Credit derivatives on pages 90&#8211;91, and Note 5 on pages 141&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q; and on pages 158&#8211;159, and Note 6 on pages 218&#8211;227 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;The Firm's net presentation of purchased and sold credit derivatives reflects the manner in which this exposure is managed, and reflects, in the Firm's view, the substantial mitigation of market and counterparty credit risk in its credit derivative activities. Market risk is substantially mitigated because market-making activities, and to a lesser extent, hedging activities, often result in selling and purchasing protection related to the same underlying reference entity. For example, for each of the five named countries, as of June&#160;30, 2013, the protection sold by the Firm was more than 93%&#32;offset by protection purchased on the identical reference entity.In addition, counterparty credit risk has been substantially mitigated by the master netting and collateral agreements in place for these credit derivatives. As of June&#160;30, 2013, 99%&#32;of the purchased protection presented in the table above is purchased under contracts that require posting of cash collateral; 91%&#32;is purchased from investment-grade counterparties domiciled outside of the selected European countries; and 71%&#32;of the protection purchased offsets protection sold on the identical reference entity, with the identical counterparty subject to a master netting agreement.102Principal investments are predominantly privately-held assets and instruments typically representing an ownership or junior capital position, that have unique risks due to their illiquidity and junior capital status, as well as lack of observable valuation data. Such investing activities, including mezzanine financing, tax-oriented investments and private equity positions, are typically intended to be held over extended investment periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term gain with respect to these investments. All investments are approved by investment committees that include executives who are not part of the investing businesses. An independent valuation function is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying values of principal investments, including private equity, in accordance with relevant accounting, valuation and risk policies.&nbsp;The Firm's approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm's general risk governance structure. Targeted levels for total and annual investments are established in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. Industry and geographic concentration limits are in place and intended to ensure diversification of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves.The Firm's merchant banking business is managed in Corporate/Private Equity (for detailed information, see Private Equity portfolio on page 51&#32;of this Form 10-Q); other lines of business may also conduct some principal investing activities, including investing in private equity positions, which are captured within their respective financial results.For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's Operational Risk Management, see pages 175&#8211;176 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.CybersecurityThe Firm devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm's computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Firm and several other U.S. financial institutions continue to experience significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which are intended to disrupt consumer online banking services. The Firm has also experienced other attempts to breach the security of its systems and data. These cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of the Firm's operations &nbsp;or material harm to the Firm's customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on the Firm's results of operations. Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm's business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients.The Firm is&#160;working with&#160;appropriate government agencies and other businesses, including our own third-party service providers, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats.For a discussion of the Firm's Legal, Fiduciary and Reputation Risk Management, see page 177 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.&nbsp;For further information on Supervision and Regulation, see Regulatory developments on pages 9&#8211;11&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and the Supervision and regulation section on pages 1&#8211;8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Form 10-K.&nbsp;DividendsAt June&#160;30, 2013, JPMorgan Chase's banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, $29.2 billion&#32;in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators.103JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant judgment.Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase's allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm's consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of the Firm's loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date. For further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm's allowance for credit losses, see Allowance for credit losses on pages 159&#8211;162 and Note 15 on pages 276&#8211;279 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report; for amounts recorded as of June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, see Allowance for credit losses on pages 92&#8211;94&#32;and Note 14 on page 176&#32;of this Form 10-Q.As noted in the discussion on pages 178&#8211;180 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report, the Firm's allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm's assumptions could affect the Firm's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis presented below is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs are not intended to imply management's expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors, nor are they intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses. Actual changes in the allowance for loan losses may be influenced by other inputs and factors, and also would be influenced by the judgment management applies to its modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of &nbsp;these modeled loss estimates based on then current circumstances and conditions.Deterioration in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm's modeled loss estimates as of June&#160;30, 2013, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm's allowance for loan losses:Management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the above factors and inputs, as well as other factors and inputs considered by management, may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions would affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows in evaluating the risk factors related to its loans, including risk ratings, home price assumptions, and credit card loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit loss is appropriate.Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventoryJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.104Assets measured at fair valueThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, see Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of thisForm 10-Q.ValuationFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value; for further details see Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally based on models that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters.Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs &#8212; &nbsp;including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Finally, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm's credit-worthiness, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. For further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, see Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm's valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill impairmentManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. For a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment, see Goodwill impairment on page 181 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.During the six months ended&#32;June 30, 2013, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuation of its mortgage lending business in CCB, which continues to have an elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The assumptions used in the valuation of this business include: (a) estimates of future cash flows for the business (which are dependent on outstanding loan balances, net interest margin, operating expense, credit losses and the amount of capital necessary given the risk of business activities to meet regulatory capital requirements), and (b) the cost of equity used to discount those cash flows to a present value. Each of these factors requires significant judgment and the assumptions used are based on management's current best estimate and most current projections, including the anticipated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, derived from the Firm's business forecasting process reviewed with senior 105management. These projections are consistent with the short-term assumptions discussed in the Business outlook on page 9&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and, in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm's best estimates of long-term growth and returns of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.As of June 30, 2013, the estimated fair value of the Firm's mortgage lending business within CCB did not exceed its carrying value; however, the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to the mortgage lending business exceeded its carrying value. For its other businesses, the Firm reviewed current conditions (including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes and current estimated market cost of equity) and prior projections of business performance. Based upon the updated valuation of its mortgage lending business and reviews of its other businesses, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to all of its reporting units was not impaired at June 30, 2013.Deterioration in economic market conditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, or additional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected business performance beyond management's current expectations. For example, in the Firm's mortgage lending business, such declines could result from increases in costs to resolve foreclosure-&nbsp;related matters or from deterioration in economic conditions that result in increased credit losses or lower mortgage origination volume. In addition, the earnings or estimated cost of equity of the Firm's capital markets businesses could also be affected by regulatory or legislative changes. Declines in business performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.For additional information on goodwill, see Note 16 on pages 184&#8211;187&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Income taxesFor a description of the significant assumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes, see Income taxes on page 182 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Litigation reservesFor a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, see Note 23 on pages 198&#8211;206&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and Note 31 on pages 316&#8211;325 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.Inclusion of the Fed funds effective swap rateIn July 2013, the FASB issued guidance that amends the acceptable U.S. benchmark interest rates for hedge accounting involving interest rate risk. In addition to interest rates on direct U.S. Treasury obligations and the LIBOR swap rate, the guidance also permits the Overnight Index Swap Rate (&#8220;OIS&#8221;) to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. The amendments are effective prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after July 17, 2013.Investment companiesIn June 2013, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the characteristics of an investment company and requires new disclosures for investment companies. Under the guidance, a company regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is considered an investment company for accounting purposes. All other companies must meet all of the fundamental characteristics described in the guidance and consider other typical characteristics to qualify as an investment company. An investment company will be required to provide additional disclosures, including the fact that the company is an investment company, information about changes, if any, in a company's status as an investment company, and information about financial support provided or contractually required to be provided by an investment company to any of its investees. The guidance will become effective in the first quarter of 2014. &nbsp;The Firm is currently evaluating this guidance to determine any potential effect on its consolidated financial statements.Presentation of other comprehensive incomeIn February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures of any reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance was effective in the first quarter of 2013. The application of this guidance had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. For further information, see Note 19 on pages 189&#8211;190&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Balance sheet nettingIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial assets and liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting agreements or similar agreements, or that have otherwise been offset on the balance sheet under certain specific conditions that permit net presentation. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance is limited to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. The Firm adopted the new guidance, effective January 1, 2013. The application of this guidance had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. For further information, see Notes 1, 5, and 12 on pages 113, 131&#8211;142, and 151&#8211;152, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.106From time to time, the Firm has made and will make forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;goal,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase's current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase's disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Firm's senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.All forward-looking statements are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Firm's control. JPMorgan Chase's actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forward-looking statements. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements:&nbsp;Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, or Current Reports on Form 8-K.107JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated statements of income (unaudited)(a)The following other-than-temporary impairment losses are included in securities gains for the periods presented.The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) are an integral part of these statements.108JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated statements of comprehensive income (unaudited)The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) are an integral part of these statements.109JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated balance sheets (unaudited)The assets of the consolidated VIEs are used to settle the liabilities of those entities.

(&#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8221; or the &#8220;Firm&#8221;), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. For a discussion of the Firm's business segments, see Note 24 on pages 207&#8211;208&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase&#32;and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.The unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information.These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;2012 Annual Report&#8221;).Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.Offsetting assets and liabilitiesU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the balance sheet when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivatives transactions, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrow and loan agreements. A master netting agreement is a single &nbsp;contract with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that contract to be terminated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due after expiration of any grace period). Upon the exercise of termination rights by the non-defaulting party, (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive value or &#8220;in the money&#8221; transactions are netted against the negative value or &#8220;out of the money&#8221; transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of repurchase agreement and securities loan default rights (i) all securities loan transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in or title transfer of securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the &#8220;demanding party&#8221;). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.For further discussion on the Firm's derivative instruments, see Note 5 on pages 131&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q. For further discussion on the Firm's repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending agreements, see Note 12 on pages 151&#8211;152&#32;of this Form&#160;10&#8209;Q. 113Note 2 &#8211; Business changes and developmentsBusiness eventsIssuance of preferred stockOn February 5, 2013, the Firm issued $900 million&#32;of noncumulative preferred stock. On April 23, 2013, the Firm issued $1.5 billion&#32;of noncumulative preferred stock. For additional information on the Firm's preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 300 of the Firm's 2012 Annual Report.Redemption of outstanding trust preferred securitiesOn May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0&#160;billion, or 100%&#32;of the liquidation amount, of the following eight series of trust preferred securities: JPMorgan Chase Capital X, XI, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XXIV, and BANK ONE Capital VI. For a further discussion of trust preferred securities, see Note 21 on pages 297&#8211;299 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Increase in common stock dividendOn May 21, 2013, the Board of Directors increased the Firm's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30&#32;per share to $0.38&#32;per share, effective with the dividend paid on July 31, 2013, to shareholders of record on July 5, 2013.One Equity PartnersAs announced on June 14, 2013, One Equity Partners (&#8220;OEP&#8221;) will raise its next fund from an external group of limited partners and then become independent from JPMorgan Chase.&#160;Until it becomes independent from the Firm, OEP will continue to make direct investments for JPMorgan Chase, and thereafter&#160;will continue to manage the then-existing group of portfolio companies for JPMorgan Chase to maximize value for the Firm.&#160;&#160;&#160;Subsequent eventsOn July 26, 2013, the Firm announced that it is pursuing strategic alternatives for its physical commodities businesses, including its remaining holdings of commodities assets and its physical trading operations. The Firm will explore a full range of options over time, including, but not limited to: a sale, spin off or strategic partnership. During the process, the Firm will continue to run its physical commodities business as a going concern. The Firm remains fully committed to its traditional banking activities in the commodity markets, including financial derivatives and the vaulting and trading of precious metals.On July 29, 2013, the Firm issued $1.5 billion&#32;of noncumulative preferred stock. On August 1, 2013, the Firm announced that it would redeem all of its outstanding 8.625%&#32;noncumulative preferred stock, Series J on September 1, 2013. For additional information on the Firm's preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 300 of the Firm's 2012 Annual Report.&nbsp;Note 3 &#8211; Fair value measurementFor a discussion of the Firm's valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 3 on pages 196&#8211;214 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.114The following table presents the asset and liabilities reported at fair value as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.115116approximates fair value for the Firm's physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm's hedge accounting relationships, see Note 5 on pages 131&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basisFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2013&#32;and 2012, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2, and from level 2 into level 3.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, certain highly rated CLOs, including $27.3 billion&#32;held in the AFS securities portfolio and $1.3 billion&#32;held in the trading portfolio, were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency.For the six months ended June 30, 2012, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $1.2 billion&#32;of derivative payables based on increased observability of certain structured equity derivatives and $1.3 billion&#32;of long-term debt due to increased observability of certain equity structured notes.All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.Level 3 valuationsThe Firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). For further information on the Firm's valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 196&#8211;214 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs &#8212; including, but not limited to, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, &nbsp;volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Finally, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm's creditworthiness, constraints on liquidity and unobservable parameters, where relevant. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole.The following table presents the Firm's primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input range does not reflect the level of input uncertainty, instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm's view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm's estimates 117and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period to period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.For the Firm's derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3, the equity and interest rate &nbsp;correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range presented. In addition, the equity and interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while commodities volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range.118Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm's positions see Note 3 on pages 196&#8211;214 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013&#32;and 2012. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the &nbsp;significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.119120121122123Level 3 analysisConsolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 2.8%&#32;of total Firm assets at June 30, 2013. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2012, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 125&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Three months ended June 30, 2013Level 3 assets were $65.7 billion&#32;at June 30, 2013, reflecting a decrease of $728 million&#32;from March 31, 2013, due to the following:Six months ended June 30, 2013Level 3 assets decreased by $32.4 billion&#32;in the first six months of 2013, due to the following:&nbsp;Gains and lossesThe following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 120&#8211;123 of this Form 10-Q.Three months ended June 30, 2013Three months ended June 30, 2012Six months ended June 30, 2013Six months ended June 30, 2012Credit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record adjustments to the Firm's estimates of fair value in order to reflect the counterparty credit quality and Firm's own creditworthiness:124therefore may be necessary to reflect the credit quality of each derivative counterparty to arrive at fair value. The Firm estimates derivatives CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected credit exposure across all of the Firm's positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses as a result of a counterparty credit event. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the expected positive exposure to each counterparty based on a simulation that assumes the current population of existing derivatives with each counterparty remains unchanged and considers contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm's credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset, (ii) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated credit default swap (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) spreads, and (iii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity, reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.&nbsp;The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisAt June 30, 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $1.6 billion&#32;and predominantly consisted of loans that had fair value adjustments in the first six months of 2013. At December&#160;31, 2012, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $5.1&#160;billion, comprised predominantly of loans that had fair value adjustments in the twelve months of 2012. At June 30, 2013, $95 million&#32;and $1.5 billion&#32;of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At December&#160;31, 2012, $667 million&#32;and $4.4&#160;billion&#32;of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. For the three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2013&#32;and 2012, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $1.6 billion&#32;of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $1.2 billion&#32;related to residential real estate loans measured at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3, as they are valued using a broker's price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm's experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 18%&#32;to 59%, with a weighted average of 29%.The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended June 30, 2013&#32;and 2012, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $293 million&#32;and $514 million, respectively; and for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, were losses of $521 million&#32;and $881 million, these reductions in recorded value were predominantly associated with loans.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.125Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair valueThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 on pages 196&#8211;214 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.126The majority of the Firm's lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, see page 198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Trading assets and liabilities &#8211; average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.127Note 4 &#8211; Fair value optionFor a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was previously elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note 4 on pages 214&#8211;216 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013&#32;and 2012, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.128129Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.At June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.6 billion&#32;and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(108) million&#32;and $(75) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 on pages 308&#8211;315 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report, and Note 21 on pages 193&#8211;197&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe table below presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk to which the structured notes' embedded derivative relates.130Note 5 &#8211; Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 on pages 218&#8211;227 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The Firm's disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm's derivatives are designated in hedge &nbsp;accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm's market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm's primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.131Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.&nbsp;While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm's derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.132Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type. 133The following table presents, as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012,&#160;the gross and net derivative receivables for which netting is permissible under U.S. GAAP by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables have been netted with respect to those receivables as to which the netting requirements have been met, including obtaining a&#160;legal opinion with respect to the enforceability of the netting (&#8220;U.S. GAAP nettable derivative receivables&#8221;); where such a legal opinion has either not been sought or obtained, the receivables are not netted, and are shown separately in the table below (&#8220;Derivative receivables not nettable under U.S. GAAP&#8221;). 134The following table presents, as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012,&#160;the gross and net derivative payables for which netting is permissible under U.S. GAAP by contract and settlement type. Derivative payables have been netted with respect to those payables as to which the netting requirements have been met, including obtaining a&#160;legal opinion with respect to the enforceability of the netting (&#8220;U.S. GAAP nettable derivative payables&#8221;); where such a legal opinion has either not been sought or obtained, the payables are not netted, and are shown separately in the table below (&#8220;Derivative payables not nettable under U.S. GAAP&#8221;). 135In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with net derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm's derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is non-cash &nbsp;financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables not nettable under U.S. GAAP. The following tables present information regarding certain non-cash financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the U.S. GAAP nettable derivative instruments and excludes additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and excludes all collateral related to derivative instruments not nettable under U.S. GAAP.&#32;Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresFor a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm's derivative contracts, see Note 6 on pages 218&#8211;227 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.&nbsp;136The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), at June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of IncomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily principal transactions revenue and net interest income.&#160; For additional information regarding amounts recorded in principal transactions revenue, see Note 6 on pages 143&#8211;144&#32;of this Form 10-Q.137138Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $42 million&#32;(after-tax) of net losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) at June 30, 2013, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.139Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, AFS securities, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm's market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives (including the synthetic credit portfolio) that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 on pages 143&#8211;144&#32;of this Form 10-Q for information on principal transactions revenue. 140Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 on pages 218&#8211;227 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm's wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain AFS securities and from certain financial instruments in the Firm's market-making businesses. For more information on the synthetic credit portfolio, see footnote (b) to the table on page 131&#32;of this Note.The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of June 30, 2013, and &nbsp;December 31, 2012. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes.The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes141The following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, where JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.142Note 6 &#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note 7 on pages 228&#8211;229 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instruments and private equity investments.Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities disclosed separately in Note 5, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives, including the synthetic credit portfolio. See Note 5 on pages 131&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q for information on the income statement classification of gains and losses on derivatives.Principal transactions revenue also includes revenue associated with market-making and client-driven activities that involve physical commodities.&#160;The Firm, through its Global Commodities Group within CIB (&#8220;Commodities Group&#8221;) generally provides risk management, investment and financing solutions to clients globally both through financial derivatives transactions, as well as through physical commodities transactions. On the financial side, the Commodities Group engages in OTC derivatives transactions (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and exchange-traded derivatives referencing various types of commodities (see below and Note 5 - Derivative instruments for further information).&#160;On the physical side, the Commodities Group engages in the purchase, sale, transport, and storage of power, gas, liquefied natural gas, coal, crude oil, refined products, precious and base metals among others. Realized gains and losses and unrealized losses arising from&#160;market-making and client-driven activities&#160;involving physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or market (market approximates fair value), subject to any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, are recorded in principal transactions revenue.&#160;Fees relating to storage and transportation are recorded in other income. These fees are generally &nbsp;recognized over the arrangement period. Expenses relating to such activities are recorded in other expense (see Note 10 on page 146&#32;of this Form 10-Q for further information).The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue by major underlying type of risk exposures.143The following table presents the components of asset management, administration and commissions.Other incomeIncluded in other income is operating lease income of $363 million&#32;and $328 million&#32;for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $712 million&#32;and $651 million&#32;for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.&nbsp;Note 7 &#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note 8 on page 230 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.144Note 8 &#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, see Note 9 on pages 231&#8211;240 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $15.1 billion&#32;and $3.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2013, and $14.6 billion&#32;and $3.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. See Note 19 on pages 189&#8211;190&#32;of this Form 10-Q for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.&nbsp;The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2013 at this time. For 2013, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $39 million. The 2013&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $39&#160;million&#32;and $2&#160;million, respectively.145Note 9 &#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note 10 on pages 241&#8211;243 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.In the first quarter of 2013, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2012 performance year, the Firm granted 43 million&#32;RSUs and 12&#160;million&#32;SARs with weighted-average grant date fair values of $46.58&#32;per RSU and $9.56&#32;per SAR.&nbsp;Note 10 &#8211; Noninterest expenseThe following table presents the components of noninterest expense.146Note 11 &#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are primarily classified as AFS or trading. Securities classified as trading are discussed in Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q. Predominantly all of the AFS securities portfolio is held by CIO in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At both June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the AFS portfolio was AA+&nbsp;&#32;(based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding AFS securities, see Note 12 on pages 244&#8211;248 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Realized gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of AFS and held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) securities were as follows for the dates indicated.147Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for AFS securities by aging category at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.148Other-than-temporary impairmentThe following table presents OTTI losses that are included in the securities gains and losses table above.&nbsp;Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell. Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally increased since December&#160;31, 2012; however, losses on securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have decreased.&#160;The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of June&#160;30,&#160;2013, the Firm does not intend to sell any securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2013.149Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at June 30, 2013, of JPMorgan Chase's AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.150Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 on page 249 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, see Note 4 on pages 128&#8211;130&#32;of this Form 10-Q. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22 on page 197&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table presents as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012&#32;the gross and net securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where netting requirements have been met, including obtaining a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement (&#8220;U.S. GAAP nettable securities purchased under resale agreements&#8221;); where such a legal opinion has either not been sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not netted, and are shown separately in the table below (&#8220;Securities purchased under resale agreements not nettable under U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Securities borrowed are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table presents information as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012&#32;regarding the U.S. GAAP nettable securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed for which a legal opinion has been obtained to support, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in bankruptcy.&#160;The below table excludes information related to resale agreements not nettable under U.S. GAAP and securities borrowed where such a legal opinion has either not been sought or obtained to support, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in bankruptcy.151The following table presents as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012&#32;the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned. Securities sold under repurchase agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities purchased under resale agreements where netting requirements have been met, including obtaining a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement (&#8220;U.S. GAAP nettable securities sold under repurchase agreements&#8221;); where such a legal opinion has either not been sought or obtained, the securities sold under repurchase agreements are not netted, and are shown separately in the table below (&#8220;Securities sold under repurchase agreements not nettable under U.S. GAAP&#8221;). Securities loaned are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table presents information as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012&#32;regarding the U.S. GAAP nettable securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned for which a legal opinion has been obtained to support, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in bankruptcy. The below table excludes information related to repurchase agreements not nettable under U.S. GAAP and securities loaned where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained to support, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in bankruptcy. Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingIn addition, at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm held $11.0 billion&#32;and $9.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets, other &nbsp;assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, accounts payable and other liabilities, and long-term debt, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.152Note 13 &#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 128&#8211;130&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:153The following tables summarize the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The&#32;Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.The following table provides information about gains/(losses) on loan sales by portfolio segment.154Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a primary focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens and mortgage loans with interest-only payment options to predominantly prime borrowers, as well as certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.&nbsp;Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans, excluding credit card. Other indicators that are taken into consideration for consumer loans, excluding credit card, include:For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm's residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days&#32;past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.155156(table continued from previous page)157The following tables represent the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.(a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual that require interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the collateral does not support the loan amount.Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options &nbsp;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm's delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.158Impaired loansThe Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (&#8220;Chapter 7 loans&#8221;) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on page 176&#32;of this Form 10-Q.159The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Loan modificationsThe global settlement, which became effective on April 5, 2012, required the Firm to, among other things, provide $3.7 billion&#32;of additional relief to certain borrowers under the Consumer Relief Program, including reductions of principal on first and second liens. For further information on the global settlement, see Mortgage Foreclosure-Related Investigations and Litigation in Note 23 on pages 204&#8211;205&#32;of this Form 10-Q.&nbsp;Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There are no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs. For further information, see Note 14 on page 252 and pages 260&#8211;262 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.160TDR activity rollforwardThe following tables reconcile the beginning and ending balances of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, modified in TDRs for the periods presented.161Nature and extent of modificationsMHA, as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and &nbsp;deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At June&#160;30, 2013, there were approximately 38,900&#32;of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 9,400&#32;senior lien home equity loans, 22,500&#32;junior lien home equity loans, 3,500&#32;prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 3,500&#32;subprime mortgages.162Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the Firm's loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications. These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.163Approximately 85%&#32;of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the HAMP program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At June&#160;30, 2013, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months are 19%&#32;for senior lien home equity, 18%&#32;for junior lien home equity, 14%&#32;for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 24%&#32;for subprime mortgages.&nbsp;Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge.&#160;Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days&#32;past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10%&#32;and 40%&#32;in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At June&#160;30, 2013, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 21%&#32;of senior lien home equity, 13%&#32;of junior lien home equity, 38%&#32;of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 28%&#32;of subprime mortgages that were 30 days&#32;or more past due.At June&#160;30, 2013, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6&#32;years for senior lien home equity, 7&#32;years for junior lien home equity, 10&#32;years for prime mortgage, including option ARMs and 8&#32;years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).164Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.165Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.The following table presents average impaired loans for the periods presented.Loan modificationsThe following table provides information about the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above.166TDR activity rollforwardThe following tables reconcile the beginning and ending balances of other consumer loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsFor auto loans, TDRs typically occur in connection with the bankruptcy of the borrower. In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness. Beginning September 30, 2012, Chapter 7 auto loans are also considered TDRs.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions.The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $11 million&#32;and $14 million&#32;during the &nbsp;three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively, and $23 million&#32;and $25 million&#32;during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. The balance of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year&#32;of the modification, was $15 million&#32;and $7&#160;million&#32;during the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively, and $28 million&#32;and $14 million&#32;during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two&#32;payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of other consumer loans for the periods presented.167Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.168Approximately 21%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of June&#160;30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, and represents the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Since the date of acquisition, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended or shortened loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expected cash flows and the accretable yield &nbsp;percentage, but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., the accretable yield balance). While extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage (because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time), shortened loan liquidation periods would have the opposite effect.169Credit card loan portfolioThe Credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days&#32;past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days&#32;past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.While the borrower's credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, because the borrower's credit score tends to be a lagging indicator, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality. However, the distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio. Refreshed FICO score information for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the table below; FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores. For more information on credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders' FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit score technology.&nbsp;The table below sets forth information about the Firm's credit card loans.170Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.Loan modificationsJPMorgan Chase may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Modifications under long-term programs involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months. The Firm may also offer short-term programs for borrowers who may be in need of temporary relief; however, none are currently being offered. Modifications under all short- and long-term programs typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs.&nbsp;If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. Assuming that the cardholder does not begin to perform in accordance with those payment terms, the loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In addition, if a borrower successfully completes a short-term modification program, then the loan reverts back to its pre-modification payment terms. However, in most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.The following table provides information regarding the nature and extent of modifications of credit card loans for the periods presented.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 33.54%&#32;for credit card loans modified as of June&#160;30, 2013, and 38.23%&#32;for credit card loans modified as of December&#160;31, 2012.171Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Notes 14 and 15 on pages 250&#8211;279 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.172(table continued from previous page)(table continued from previous page)173Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans are comprised of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14 on page 176&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.174Loan modificationsCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. For further information, see Note 14 on page 252 and pages 274&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The following tables provide information about the Firm's wholesale loans that have been modified in TDRs, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of such loans and information regarding the nature and extent of modifications during the periods presented.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsWholesale loans modified as TDRs are typically term or payment extensions and, to a lesser extent, deferrals of principal and/or interest on commercial and industrial and real estate loans. For the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 0.9&#32;years and 1.3&#32;years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all wholesale loans modified during these periods was 1.4&#32;years and 2.8&#32;years, respectively. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification were $1 million&#32;and $5 million&#32;during the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. &nbsp;For the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 2.1&#32;years and 1.3&#32;years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all wholesale loans modified during these periods was 1.6&#32;years and 3.6&#32;years, respectively. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification were $1 million&#32;and $52 million&#32;during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.175Note 14 &#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 on pages 276&#8211;279 JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.176Note 15 &#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;), see Note 1 on pages 193&#8211;194 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described in Note 16 on page 288 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 on page 281 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm's primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 181&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CIB and CCB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm's involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 on pages 281&#8211;284 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.177The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 182&#32;of this Note for further information regarding the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities on pages 182&#8211;183&#32;of this Note for information on the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies. 178Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 on page 283 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.At June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 181&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 on page 283 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report. See the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase'sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 on pages 283&#8211;284 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Firm transferred $2.9 billion&#32;and $7.1 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs. There were no securities transferred to private-label VIEs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, the Firm transferred $3.1 billion&#32;and $6.0 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and zero&#32;and $241 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm consolidated $88 million&#32;and $76 million, respectively, of assets, and $3 million&#32;and $5 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 181&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated re-securitization transactions.&nbsp;As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $3.8 billion&#32;and $4.6 billion, respectively. At June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm held approximately $2.4 billion&#32;and $2.0 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $5 million&#32;and $61 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. See the table on page 178&#32;of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 284&#8211;285 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper, including commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $3.8 billion&#32;and $8.3 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments were not driven by market liquidity and the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm provides lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded portion of these commitments was $12.1 billion&#32;and $10.8 billion&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively, which are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21 on pages 193&#8211;197&#32;of this Form 10-Q.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 285&#8211;286 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.179The Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, was as follows.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 on pages 286&#8211;288 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Exposure to nonconsolidated credit-related note and asset swap VIEs at June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, was as follows.&nbsp;The Firm consolidated credit-related note vehicles with collateral fair values of $410 million&#32;and $483 million, at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. These consolidated VIEs included some that were structured by the Firm where the Firm provides the credit derivative, and some that have been structured by third parties where the Firm is not the credit derivative provider. The Firm consolidated these vehicles, because it held positions in these entities that provided the Firm with control. The Firm did not consolidate any asset swap vehicles at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 288 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.180Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.Supplemental information on loan securitizationsThe Firm securitizes and sells a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debt securities. The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.181Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to the Firm's securitization activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Loans and excess mortgage servicing rights sold to agencies and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess mortgage servicing rights on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the &#8220;Agencies&#8221;). These loans and excess mortgage servicing rights are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans and excess mortgage servicing rights through certain guarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 on pages 308&#8211;315 of the Firm's 2012 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 on pages 184&#8211;187&#32;of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the impact of the Firm's sale of certain excess mortgage servicing rights.&nbsp;The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. agencies and third-party-sponsored securitization entities.182Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21 on pages 193&#8211;197&#32;of this Form 10-Q, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm may elect to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. As of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets $14.6 billion&#32;and $15.6 billion, respectively of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominately all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $1.8 billion&#32;and $1.6&#160;billion&#32;as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and reimbursement is proceeding normally. For additional information, refer to Note 13 on pages 153&#8211;175&#32;of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 on pages 250&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's interest in securitized assets held at fair valueThe following table outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value, as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, of certain of the Firm's retained interests in nonconsolidated VIEs (other than MSRs), that are valued using modeling techniques. The table also outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10%&#32;and 20%&#32;adverse changes in assumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 184&#8211;187&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value based on a 10%&#32;or 20%&#32;variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivities also do not reflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks.183Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Note 16 &#8211; Goodwill and other intangible assetsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 17 on pages 291&#8211;295 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.&nbsp;The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.Goodwill was not impaired at June&#160;30, 2013, or December&#160;31, 2012, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.The goodwill impairment test is based upon a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units' allocated equity plus goodwill capital as a proxy for the carrying amounts of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a basis similar to that used for the allocation of equity to the Firm's lines of business, which primarily considers stand-alone peer comparisons and regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III), although economic risk capital is also considered. Proposed line of business equity levels are incorporated into the Firm's annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm's Board of Directors. Allocated 184equity is further reviewed on a periodic basis and updated as needed. For a discussion of the primary method used to estimate the fair values of the reporting units, see Impairment testing on pages 291&#8211;292 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.While no impairment of goodwill was recognized, the Firm's mortgage lending business in CCB remains at an elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The valuation of this business is particularly dependent upon economic conditions (including new unemployment claims and home prices), regulatory and legislative changes (for example, those related to residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities), and the amount of equity capital required. In addition, the earnings or estimated cost of equity of the Firm's capital markets businesses could also be affected by regulatory or legislative changes. Declines in business performance, increases in allocated equity capital, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the &nbsp;estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.Mortgage servicing rightsMortgage servicing rights represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 291&#8211;295 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report and Note 3 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.185with these advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance.The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm's MSRs at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below. CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsThe $284 million&#32;decrease in other intangible assets during the six months ended&#32;June 30, 2013, was due to amortization.186The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were as follows.Amortization expenseThe following table presents amortization expense related to credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets.Future amortization expenseThe following table presents estimated future amortization expense related to credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets at June 30, 2013.187Note 17 &#8211; DepositsFor further discussion on deposits, see Note 19 on page 296 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.At June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.&nbsp;Note 18 &#8211; Earnings per shareFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), see Note 24 on page 301 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012.188Note 19 &#8211; Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, and net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.189The following table presents the pretax and after-tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss).190Note 20 &#8211; Regulatory capitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm's national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Chase Bank USA, N.A.There are two categories of risk-based capital: Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity, perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred securities, less goodwill and certain other adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 capital, subordinated long-term debt and other instruments qualifying as Tier 2 capital, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a certain percentage of risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;). Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. RWA consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets, such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, and derivatives, are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. RWA also incorporate a measure for the market risk related to applicable trading assets&#8211;debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total RWA.&nbsp;Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 and Total capital to RWA, as well as minimum leverage ratios (which are defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. Banking subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. As of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.The following table presents the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant banking subsidiaries at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. These amounts are determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and/or OCC. The table reflects the Firm's and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s implementation of rules that provide for additional capital requirements for trading positions and securitizations (&#8220;Basel 2.5&#8221;). Basel 2.5 rules became effective for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on January 1, 2013. The implementation of these rules in the first quarter of 2013 resulted in an increase of approximately $150&#160;billion&#32;and $140 billion, respectively, in the Firm's and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s risk-weighted assets compared with the Basel I rules at March 31, 2013. The implementation of these rules also resulted in decreases of the Firm's Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 140&#32;basis points and 160&#32;basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2013, and decreases of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 130&#32;basis points and 150&#32;basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2013. Implementation of Basel 2.5 in the first quarter of 2013 did not impact Chase Bank USA, N.A.'s RWA or Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios.191A reconciliation of the Firm's Total stockholders' equity to Tier 1 capital and Total qualifying capital is presented in the table below.192Note 21 &#8211; Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm's related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 308&#8211;315 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;To provide for the risk of loss inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale contracts, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on page 176&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. The amounts in the table below for lending-related commitments represent the total available credit, inclusive of certain non-legally binding lines of credit. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these non-legally binding lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower. Also, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days&#32;or more past due.193194Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged and acquisition finance activities, which were $10.1 billion&#32;and $8.8 billion&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4 on pages 114&#8211;127&#32;and 128&#8211;130&#32;respectively, of this Form 10-Q.In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as clearing and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. For the three months ended&#32;June 30, 2013, the tri-party repurchase daily balances averaged $332 billion.&nbsp;GuaranteesThe Firm considers the following off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 308&#8211;315 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLC&#8221;) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $636&#160;million&#32;and $649&#160;million&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; these carrying values included $290&#160;million&#32;and $284&#160;million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $346&#160;million&#32;and $365 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm's customers, as of June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit195Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 on pages 308&#8211;315 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $56.9&#160;billion&#32;and $61.7&#160;billion&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm's maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $26.7&#160;billion&#32;and $26.5&#160;billion&#32;and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.8&#160;billion&#32;at both June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $170&#160;million&#32;and $122&#160;million&#32;and derivative receivables of $55&#160;million&#32;and $80&#160;million&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5 on pages 141&#8211;142&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsMortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm's loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs and other loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, as described in Note 15 on pages 177&#8211;184&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 on pages 280&#8211;291 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm may be, and has been, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense.There have been generalized allegations, as well as specific demands, that the Firm repurchase loans sold or deposited into private-label securitizations (including claims from insurers that have guaranteed certain obligations of the securitization trusts). Although the Firm encourages parties to use the contractual repurchase process established in the governing agreements, these private-label repurchase &nbsp;claims have generally manifested themselves through threatened or pending litigation. Accordingly, the liability related to repurchase demands associated with all of the private-label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 on pages 198&#8211;206&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;and Note 31 on pages 316&#8211;325 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report.The Firm has recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $2.5 billion&#32;and $2.8 billion, as June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. This repurchase liability is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities net of probable recoveries from third-party originators of $403 million&#32;and $441 million&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The Firm's mortgage repurchase liability is intended to cover losses associated with all loans previously sold in connection with loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs, regardless of when those losses occur or how they are ultimately resolved (e.g., repurchase, make-whole payment).Substantially all of the estimates and assumptions underlying the Firm's established methodology for computing its recorded mortgage repurchase liability &#8212; including factors such as the amount of probable future demands from the GSEs (based on both historical experience and the Firm's expectations about the GSEs future behavior), the ability of the Firm to cure identified defects, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, and recoveries from third parties &#8212; require application of a significant level of management judgment.While the Firm uses the best information available to it in estimating its mortgage repurchase liability, the estimation process is inherently uncertain and imprecise and, accordingly, losses in excess of the amounts accrued as of June 30, 2013, are reasonably possible. The Firm believes the estimate of the range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of its established repurchase liability, is from $0&#32;to approximately $0.7 billion&#32;at June 30, 2013. This estimated range of reasonably possible loss considers the Firm's GSE-related exposure based on an assumed peak to trough decline in home prices of 32%, which is an additional 6&#32;percentage point decline in home prices beyond the Firm's current assumptions derived from a nationally recognized home price index. Although the Firm does not consider a further decline in home prices of this magnitude likely to occur, such a decline could increase the levels of loan delinquencies, which may, in turn, increase the level of repurchase demands from the GSEs and potentially result in additional repurchases of loans at greater loss severities and thereby increase the Firm's mortgage repurchase liability.196The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Loans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm's securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $8.6&#160;billion&#32;and $9.3&#160;billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm's view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $140 million&#32;and $141 million&#32;at June 30, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively.&nbsp;Note 22 &#8211; Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of the Firm's pledged assets and collateral, see Note 30 on pages 315&#8211;316 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.Pledged assetsAt June 30, 2013, assets were pledged to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, at June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had pledged $292.8 billion&#32;and $291.7 billion, respectively, of financial instruments it owns that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 on pages 177&#8211;184&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 on pages 280&#8211;291 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report, for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs.CollateralAt June 30, 2013, and December 31, 2012, the Firm had accepted assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $723.7 billion&#32;and $757.1 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $598.6 billion&#32;and $545.0 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. 197Note 23 &#8211; Litigation ContingenciesAs of June 30, 2013, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0&#32;to approximately $6.8 billion&#32;at June 30, 2013. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm is involved, taking into account the Firm's best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Firm's estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.Auction-Rate Securities Investigations and Litigation. Beginning in March 2008, several regulatory authorities initiated investigations of a number of industry participants, including the Firm, concerning possible state and federal securities law violations in connection with the sale of auction-rate securities (&#8220;ARS&#8221;). The market for many such securities had frozen and a significant number of auctions for those securities began to fail in February 2008.The Firm, on behalf of itself and affiliates, agreed to a settlement in principle with the New York Attorney General's Office which provided, among other things, that the Firm would offer to purchase at par certain ARS purchased from J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Chase Investment Services Corp. and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. by individual investors, charities and small- to medium-sized businesses. The Firm also agreed to a substantively similar &nbsp;settlement in principle with the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida and the North American Securities Administrators Association (&#8220;NASAA&#8221;) Task Force, which agreed to recommend approval of the settlement to all remaining states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Firm has finalized the settlement agreements with the New York Attorney General's Office and the Office of Financial Regulation for the State of Florida. The settlement agreements provide for the payment of penalties totaling $25 million&#32;to all states and territories. To date, final consent agreements have been reached with all but three of NASAA's members.Bear Stearns Hedge Fund Matters. The Bear Stearns Companies LLC (formerly The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.)(&#8220;Bear Stearns&#8221;), certain current or former subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, including Bear Stearns Asset Management, Inc. (&#8220;BSAM&#8221;) and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., and certain individuals formerly employed by Bear Stearns are named defendants (collectively the &#8220;Bear Stearns defendants&#8221;) in multiple civil actions and arbitrations relating to alleged losses resulting from the failure of the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Master Fund, Ltd. (the &#8220;High Grade Fund&#8221;) and the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the &#8220;Enhanced Leverage Fund&#8221;) (collectively the &#8220;Funds&#8221;). BSAM served as investment manager for both of the Funds, which were organized such that there were U.S. and Cayman Islands &#8220;feeder funds&#8221; that invested substantially all their assets, directly or indirectly, in the Funds. The Funds are in liquidation.There are currently two&#32;civil actions pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the Funds. The first pending action, brought by the Joint Voluntary Liquidators of the Cayman Islands feeder funds, alleges that the Bear Stearns defendants mismanaged the Funds. This action alleges net losses of approximately $700 million&#32;and seeks compensatory and punitive damages. The parties reached an agreement to resolve the litigation for $257 million. In June 2013, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands approved the settlement and subsequently the U.S. District Court dismissed the action with leave to reinstate if settlement conditions are not met. The second action was brought by Bank of America and Banc of America Securities LLC (together &#8220;BofA&#8221;) alleging breach of contract, fraud and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with a $4 billion&#32;securitization in May 2007 known as a &#8220;CDO-squared,&#8221; for which BSAM served as collateral manager. This securitization was composed of certain collateralized debt obligation holdings that were purchased by BofA from the Funds. BofA currently seeks damages up to approximately $540 million. Motions for summary judgment are pending.Bear Stearns Shareholder Litigation and Related Matters. Various shareholders of Bear Stearns have commenced purported class actions against Bear Stearns and certain of its former officers and/or directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of Bear Stearns between December 14, 2006, and March 14, 1982008 (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;). The actions alleged that the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding Bear Stearns' business and financial results and that, as a result of those false statements, Bear Stearns' common stock traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period. In November 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval of a $275 million&#32;settlement. Certain investors have elected not to participate in the class settlement, and some of them have proceeded separately with individual actions or arbitrations and others may do likewise.Bear Stearns, former members of Bear Stearns' Board of Directors and certain of Bear Stearns' former executive officers have also been named as defendants in a shareholder derivative and class action suit which is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violations of federal securities laws, waste of corporate assets and gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, and indemnification and contribution in connection with the losses sustained by Bear Stearns as a result of its purchases of subprime loans and certain repurchases of its own common stock. Certain individual defendants are also alleged to have sold their holdings of Bear Stearns common stock while in possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in an unspecified amount. The District Court dismissed the action in January 2011, and plaintiffs have appealed.CIO Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to a consolidated shareholder class action, a consolidated class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) and shareholder derivative actions that have been filed in New York state court and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as well as shareholder demands and government investigations, relating to losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm's Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;). The Firm has received requests for documents and information in connection with governmental inquiries and investigations by Congress, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;), the UK Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), the State of Massachusetts and other government agencies. The Firm is cooperating with these investigations.Four&#32;putative class actions alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Firm's common stock. The cases were consolidated and lead plaintiffs were appointed pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. The consolidated second amended complaint defines the putative class as purchasers of the Firm's common stock between February 24, 2010 and May 21, 2012, and alleges &nbsp;that the Firm and certain current and former officers made false or misleading statements concerning CIO's role, the Firm's risk management practices and the Firm's financial results, as well as in connection with the disclosure of losses in the synthetic credit portfolio in 2012. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.Separately, two&#32;putative class actions were filed on behalf of participants who held the Firm's common stock in the Firm's retirement plans. These actions have been consolidated, and the consolidated third amended complaint alleges a class period of December 20, 2011 to July 12, 2012, and asserts claims under ERISA solely on behalf of participants in the Firm's 401(k) Savings Plan for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the Firm, certain affiliates and certain current and former directors and officers. The complaint generally alleges that defendants breached the duty of prudence by allowing investment in the Firm's common stock when they knew or should have known that such stock was unsuitable for the plan and that the Firm and certain current and former officers made false or misleading statements concerning the Firm's financial condition. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.Nine&#32;shareholder derivative actions (some of which have been consolidated) have also been filed, purportedly on behalf of the Firm, against certain of the Firm's current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties. These actions generally allege that defendants failed to exercise adequate oversight over CIO and to manage the risk of CIO's activities, which allegedly led to CIO's losses. Defendants have filed or expect to file motions to dismiss and/or to stay all of these actions. In April 2013, the New York state court granted defendants' motion to dismiss one&#32;of the shareholder derivative actions.City of Milan Litigation and Criminal Investigation. In January 2009, the City of Milan, Italy (the &#8220;City&#8221;) issued civil proceedings against (among others) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (together, &#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8221;) in the District Court of Milan. The proceedings relate to (a) a bond issue by the City in June 2005 (the &#8220;Bond&#8221;), and (b) an associated swap transaction, which was subsequently restructured on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2007 (the &#8220;Swap&#8221;). The City seeks damages and/or other remedies against JPMorgan Chase (among others) on the grounds of alleged &#8220;fraudulent and deceitful acts&#8221; and alleged breach of advisory obligations in connection with the Swap and the Bond, together with related swap transactions with other counterparties. The Firm has entered into a settlement agreement with the City to resolve the City's civil proceedings.In March 2010, a criminal judge directed four&#32;current and former JPMorgan Chase personnel and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (as well as other individuals and three&#32;other banks) to go forward to a full trial that started in May 2010. As it relates to JPMorgan Chase individuals, two were acquitted and two were found guilty of aggravated fraud with sanctions of prison sentences, fines and a ban from dealing with Italian public bodies for one year. JPMorgan 199Chase (along with other banks involved) was found liable for breaches of Italian administrative law, fined &#8364;1 million&#32;and ordered to forfeit profit from the transaction (for JPMorgan Chase, totaling &#8364;24.7 million). JPMorgan Chase and the individuals are appealing the verdict, and none of the sanctions will take effect until all appeal avenues have been exhausted.Credit Default Swaps Investigations and Litigation. In July 2013, the European Commission (the &#8220;EC&#8221;) filed a Statement of Objections against the Firm (including various subsidiaries) and other industry members in connection with its ongoing investigation into the credit default swaps (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) marketplace. The EC asserts that between 2006 and 2009, a number of investment banks acted collectively through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) and Markit to shut out exchanges by instructing Markit and ISDA to license their respective data and index benchmarks only for over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) trading and not for exchange trading, allegedly to protect the investment banks' revenues from the OTC market. The Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) also has an ongoing investigation into the CDS marketplace, which was initiated in July 2009.Separately, four&#32;putative class actions naming the Firm and brought on behalf of purchasers and sellers of CDS have been filed in various federal District Courts asserting federal antitrust law claims. Each of the complaints refers to the ongoing investigations by the EC and DOJ into the CDS market, and alleges that the defendant investment banks and dealers, including the Firm, as well as Markit and/or ISDA,&#32;collectively prevented new entrants into the CDS market, in order to artificially inflate the defendants' OTC&#32;revenues.Enron Litigation. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its officers and directors are involved in two&#32;lawsuits seeking damages arising out of the Firm's banking relationships with Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (&#8220;Enron&#8221;). Motions to dismiss are pending in both of these lawsuits: an individual action by Enron investors and an action by an Enron counterparty. A number of actions and other proceedings against the Firm previously were resolved, including a class action lawsuit captioned Newby v. Enron Corp. and adversary proceedings brought by Enron's bankruptcy estate.FERC Matters. In July 2013, J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp. (&#8220;JMPVEC&#8221;) agreed to a settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the &#8220;FERC&#8221;) resolving its investigation relating to the Firm's bidding practices in certain organized power markets.&#160; As part of this agreement, JPMVEC agreed to pay, without admitting or denying any violations, disgorgement, penalties and interest totaling $410 million, and to waive claims to certain payments from the California Independent System Operator that for the most part had not been taken into income.&#160; Pursuant to the settlement, the FERC has released JPMVEC, its affiliates and their employees from any claims in connection with activity that was subject to investigation.&#160; &nbsp;This settlement did not have a material impact on the Firm's results of operations for the second quarter of 2013.&#160; Identity Theft Products. The OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) have separately advised Chase Bank USA, N.A, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. of their determinations to seek administrative orders with respect to the banks' compliance with Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Sections 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, respectively, as well as management and oversight of third parties with respect to certain identity theft products previously offered by the banks. The Firm has reimbursed fees paid by certain customers of these products.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations have filed a series of putative class action complaints relating to interchange in several federal courts. The complaints allege, among other claims, that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain other banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. All cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for pretrial proceedings.In October 2012, Visa, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association, MasterCard Incorporated, MasterCard International Incorporated and various United States financial institution defendants, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Chase Bank USA, N.A., Chase Paymentech Solutions, LLC and certain predecessor institutions, entered into a settlement agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) to resolve the claims of the U.S. merchant and retail association plaintiffs (the &#8220;Class Plaintiffs&#8221;) in the multi-district litigation. In November 2012, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the Settlement Agreement, which provides for, among other things, a cash payment of $6.05 billion&#32;to the Class Plaintiffs (of which the Firm's share is approximately 20%), and an amount equal to ten&#32;basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight&#32;months to be measured from a date within 60 days&#32;of the end of the opt-out period. The Settlement Agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network's rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. The rule modifications became effective in January 2013. In April 2013, Class Plaintiffs moved for final approval of the settlement. The time for merchants to opt out and/or object to the class settlement ended in late May 2013. A number of merchants that opted out have filed actions against Visa and MasterCard, and two&#32;such actions name the Firm and various of its affiliates as defendants. The hearing on final approval of the class settlement is scheduled for September 2013.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending three&#32;pending cases that allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs claim that JPMorgan 200Investment Management is liable for losses of more than $1 billion&#32;in market value of these securities. In the case filed by Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and the case filed by Ambac Assurance UK Limited in New York state court, discovery is proceeding on claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence. The third case, filed by CMMF LLP in New York state court, asserts claims under New York law for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Trial of the CMMF action was completed in February 2013, and the Court's decision is pending.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (&#8220;LBHI&#8221;) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $8.6 billion&#32;in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI's bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s collateral requests hastened LBHI's bankruptcy. The Firm moved to dismiss plaintiffs' amended complaint in its entirety, and also moved to transfer the litigation from the Bankruptcy Court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In April 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued a decision granting in part and denying in part the Firm's motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint seeking avoidance of the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008. The Court denied the Firm's motion to dismiss as to the other claims, including claims that allege intentional misconduct. In September 2012, the District Court denied the transfer motion without prejudice to its renewal in the future, but stated that any trial would likely have to be conducted before the District Court.The Firm also filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large clearing advances to Lehman against inappropriate collateral, which left the Firm with more than $25 billion&#32;in claims (the &#8220;Clearing Claims&#8221;) against the estate of Lehman Brothers Inc. (&#8220;LBI&#8221;), LBHI's broker-dealer subsidiary. These claims have been paid in full, subject to the outcome of the litigation. Discovery is ongoing.LBHI and the Committee have filed an objection to the deficiency claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to the Clearing Claims, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for such claims in a commercially reasonable manner. The Firm responded to LBHI's objection in November 2011. Discovery is ongoing.LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors have filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the &nbsp;amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm responded to this separate complaint and objection in February 2013. Discovery is ongoing.LIBOR Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, CFTC, SEC and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission, UK Financial Services Authority (now known as the Financial Conduct Authority), Canadian Competition Bureau, Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world. The documents and information sought relate primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the BBA's London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to European Banking Federation (&#8220;EBF&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the EBF's Euro Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;) and to the Japanese Bankers' Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;TIBOR&#8221;) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class actions filed in various federal and state courts in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR and/or Euroyen TIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are impacted by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, or Euroyen TIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages.The U.S. dollar LIBOR-related putative class actions have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, where the Court has appointed interim lead counsel for three&#32;proposed classes: (i) direct purchasers over-the-counter of U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments; (ii) purchasers of U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments on an exchange (the &#8220;exchange plaintiffs&#8221;); and (iii) purchasers of debt securities that pay an interest rate linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR. In March 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss the claims asserted in these three&#32;putative class actions, as well as in three&#32;related individual actions brought by various Charles Schwab entities (the &#8220;Schwab plaintiffs&#8221;). The Court dismissed with prejudice the federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act claims asserted by these plaintiffs and the state antitrust law claims asserted by the Schwab plaintiffs, 201as well as a New York unjust enrichment claim asserted by certain plaintiffs and certain claims under the Commodities Exchange Act (the &#8220;CEA&#8221;). The Court declined to dismiss certain other CEA claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over certain state and common law claims. The plaintiffs in the three&#32;putative class actions have moved for leave to file amended complaints that seek to replead their federal antitrust claims. In addition, the exchange plaintiffs have moved for leave to amend their CEA claims and for permission to seek an interlocutory appeal of certain aspects of the Court's decision. All of the other actions pending before this Court that were not the subject of the defendants' motion to dismiss have been stayed.In April 2013, the Schwab plaintiffs commenced a new U.S. dollar LIBOR action in California state court alleging federal securities law claims and various California state law claims. The defendants removed this action to federal court, and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation subsequently entered an order conditionally transferring this action to the Southern District of New York. The Schwab plaintiffs have moved to have the case remanded to California state court. In addition to the Schwab plaintiffs' new action, there are six&#32;individual U.S. dollar LIBOR actions that are pending in other courts and that assert, among other things, federal and state antitrust claims and state common law claims. In August 2012, a shareholder derivative action was filed in New York state court, purportedly on behalf of the Firm, against certain of the Firm's current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties in connection with the alleged manipulation of LIBOR. In April 2013, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the action. In June 2013, a second U.S. dollar LIBOR-related shareholder derivative action was filed in New York state court, purportedly on behalf of the Firm, against certain of the Firm's current and former directors. The Firm also has been named as a defendant in a purported class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which seeks to bring claims on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased or sold exchange-traded Euroyen futures and options contracts. Defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiff's second amended complaint. Madoff Litigation. JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have been named as defendants in a lawsuit brought by the trustee (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;) for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (&#8220;Madoff&#8221;). The Trustee has served an amended complaint in which he has asserted 28&#32;causes of action against JPMorgan Chase, 20&#32;of which seek to avoid certain transfers (direct or indirect) made to JPMorgan Chase that are alleged to have been preferential or fraudulent under the federal Bankruptcy Code and the New York Debtor and Creditor Law. The remaining causes of action involve claims for, among other things, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, contribution &nbsp;and unjust enrichment in connection with Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The complaint asserts common law claims that purport to seek approximately $19 billion&#32;in damages, together with bankruptcy law claims to recover approximately $425 million&#32;in transfers that JPMorgan Chase allegedly received directly or indirectly from Bernard Madoff's brokerage firm. In October 2011, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted JPMorgan Chase's motion to dismiss the common law claims asserted by the Trustee, and returned the remaining claims to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings. The Trustee appealed this decision and in June 2013 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision.Separately, J.P. Morgan Trust Company (Cayman) Limited, JPMorgan (Suisse) SA, J.P. Morgan Securities plc, Bear Stearns Alternative Assets International Ltd., J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp., J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA, and J.P. Morgan Markets Limited (formerly Bear Stearns International Limited) were named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited (together, &#8220;Fairfield&#8221;), so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions are based on theories of mistake and restitution, among other theories, and seek to recover payments made to defendants by the funds totaling approximately $155 million. Pursuant to an agreement with the Trustee, the liquidators of Fairfield have voluntarily dismissed their action against J.P. Morgan Securities plc without prejudice to refiling. The other actions remain outstanding. In addition, a purported class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc to an already pending purported class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those raised by the Trustee. The Court dismissed these complaints and plaintiffs have appealed. Oral argument on the appeal was held in April 2013 and the Firm is awaiting the Court's decision.The Firm is a defendant in five&#32;other Madoff-related actions pending in New York state court and one purported class action in federal District Court in New York. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. The Firm has moved to dismiss both the state and federal actions.The Firm is also responding to various governmental investigations relating to Madoff, including by the Department of Justice and other regulators.MF Global. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was named as one&#32;of several defendants in a number of putative class action lawsuits brought by former customers of MF Global in 202federal District Courts in New York, Illinois and Montana. The lawsuits were consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The actions alleged, among other things, that the Firm aided and abetted MF Global's alleged misuse of customer money and breaches of fiduciary duty and was unjustly enriched by the transfer of certain customer segregated funds by MF Global.In June 2012, the Securities Investor Protection Act (&#8220;SIPA&#8221;) Trustee issued a Report of the Trustee's Investigation and Recommendations, and stated that he was considering potential claims against the Firm with respect to certain transfers identified in the Report.In March 2013, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement with the customer class plaintiffs and the SIPA Trustee, pursuant to which the Firm has agreed to pay a total of $107.5 million&#32;to resolve all claims that have been or could be asserted by the customer class and the SIPA Trustee against the Firm and any of its affiliates or employees. In addition, under the proposed settlement, the Firm has agreed to release certain liens and set-off rights it had retained in certain MF Global proprietary funds that were previously remitted to the SIPA Trustee, and to remit certain additional MF Global proprietary funds that the Firm held to secure potential obligations under certain agreements with MF Global and its U.K. affiliate. The Firm will also be entitled to a $60 million&#32;general unsecured claim in the MF Global broker-dealer bankruptcy proceeding. The settlement was approved by both the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court in July 2013.The Firm has also reached a settlement with the MF Global Chapter 11 debtors to resolve all claims that could potentially be asserted by those parties against the Firm in exchange for a portion of the proceeds, if any, that the Firm receives in connection with the aforementioned $60 million&#32;unsecured claim. This settlement is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. The Firm is also continuing to respond to inquiries from the CFTC concerning MF Global.J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one&#32;of several defendants in a number of purported class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global's publicly traded securities, including the securities issued pursuant to MF Global's June 2010 secondary offering of common stock and February 2011 and August 2011 convertible note offerings. The actions have been consolidated before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In August 2012, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which asserts violations of the Securities Act of 1933 against the underwriter defendants and alleges that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global's financial position, internal controls and risk management, as such topics relate to its exposure to European sovereign debt. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.&nbsp;Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Mortgage-Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates, Bear Stearns and affiliates and Washington Mutual affiliates have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles as issuer, originator or underwriter in MBS offerings. These cases include purported class action suits, actions by individual purchasers of securities or by trustees for the benefit of purchasers of securities, an action by the New York State Attorney General and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of securities offerings. Although the allegations vary by lawsuit, these cases generally allege that the offering documents for securities issued by numerous securitization trusts contained material misrepresentations and omissions, including with regard to the underwriting standards pursuant to which the underlying mortgage loans were issued, or assert that various representations or warranties relating to the loans were breached at the time of origination. There are currently pending and tolled investor claims involving approximately $166 billion&#32;of such securities. In addition, and as described below, there are pending and threatened claims by monoline insurers and by and on behalf of trustees that involve some of these and other securitizations.In the actions against the Firm as an MBS issuer (and, in some cases, also as an underwriter of its own MBS offerings), three&#32;purported class actions are pending against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, and/or certain of their affiliates and current and former employees, in the United States District Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York. Motions to dismiss have been largely denied in these cases, and they are in various stages of litigation.In addition to class actions, the Firm is also a defendant in individual actions brought against certain affiliates of JPMorgan Chase, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as issuers (and, in some cases, as underwriters) of MBS. These actions involve claims by or to benefit various institutional investors and governmental agencies. These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the United States and are in various stages of litigation.In actions against the Firm solely as an underwriter of other issuers' MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable where the issuers are now defunct, such as in a pending case where the Firm has been named involving affiliates of IndyMac Bancorp. The Firm may also be contractually obligated to indemnify underwriters in certain deals it issued.EMC Mortgage LLC (formerly EMC Mortgage Corporation) (&#8220;EMC&#8221;), an indirect subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and certain other JPMorgan Chase entities currently are defendants in nine&#32;pending actions commenced by bond insurers that guaranteed payments of principal and interest on certain classes of 19&#32;different MBS offerings. These 203actions are pending in federal and state courts in New York and are in various stages of litigation. Certain JPMorgan Chase entities, in their capacities as alleged successors in interest to Bear Stearns and EMC, have been named as defendants in a civil suit filed by the New York State Attorney General in New York state court in connection with Bear Stearns' due diligence and quality control practices relating to MBS.The Firm or its affiliates are defendants in actions brought by trustees or master servicers of various MBS trusts and others on behalf of the purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. The first action was commenced by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, against the Firm and the FDIC based on MBS issued by Washington Mutual Bank and its affiliates; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. The other actions are at various initial stages of litigation in the New York and Delaware state courts, including actions brought by MBS trustees, each specific to one or more MBS transactions, against EMC and/or JPMorgan Chase. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans, as well as indemnification of attorneys' fees and costs and other remedies.There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation, and the Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased such securities that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. In addition, the Firm has received several demands by securitization trustees that threaten litigation, as well as demands by investors directing or threatening to direct trustees to investigate claims or bring litigation, based on purported obligations to repurchase loans out of securitization trusts and alleged servicing deficiencies. These include but are not limited to a demand from a law firm, as counsel to a group of purchasers of MBS that purport to have 25%&#32;or more of the voting rights in as many as 191&#32;different trusts sponsored by the Firm or its affiliates with an original principal balance of more than $174 billion&#32;(excluding 52&#32;trusts sponsored by Washington Mutual, with an original principal balance of more than $58 billion), made to various trustees to investigate potential repurchase and servicing claims. Further, there have been repurchase and servicing claims made in litigation against trustees not affiliated with the Firm, but involving trusts that the Firm sponsored.In April 2012, the New York state court granted the Firm's motion to dismiss a shareholder complaint asserting claims against current and former members of the Firm's Board of Directors based on alleged wrongful actions and inactions relating to originations and securitizations. In February 2013, the court's order was affirmed on appeal, and the New York Court of Appeals thereafter denied plaintiff's motion for leave to appeal. A second shareholder complaint has been filed in New York state court alleging that the Firm's Board of Directors allowed the Firm to engage in &nbsp;wrongful conduct regarding the sale of residential MBS and failed to implement adequate internal controls to prevent such wrongdoing. In June 2013, two&#32;shareholders filed a third derivative action in New York state court alleging breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of MBS.&#160;The Firm is responding to parallel investigations being conducted by the Civil and Criminal Divisions of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. In May 2013, the Firm received a notice from Civil Division stating that it has preliminarily concluded that the Firm violated certain federal securities laws in connection with its subprime and Alt-A residential MBS offerings during 2005 to 2007.In addition to the above-described matters, the Firm has also received, and responded to, a number of subpoenas and informal requests for information from other federal and state authorities concerning mortgage-related matters, including inquiries concerning a number of transactions involving the Firm and its affiliates' origination and purchase of whole loans, underwriting, issuance and trading of MBS, treatment of early payment defaults, potential breaches of securitization representations and warranties, reserves and due diligence in connection with securitizations. The Firm continues to respond to other MBS-related regulatory inquiries.Mortgage Foreclosure-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorneys General of Massachusetts and New York have separately filed lawsuits against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry's electronic mortgage registry. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss the Massachusetts action and the Firm has reached a settlement in the New York action.The Firm is named as a defendant in two&#32;purported class action lawsuits relating to its mortgage foreclosure procedures. In one action, the Firm has moved to dismiss an amended complaint, and in the other action, plaintiff has moved for class certification.Two&#32;shareholder derivative actions have been filed in New York Supreme Court against the Firm's Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. These actions seek declaratory relief and damages. In July 2012, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in the first-filed action and gave plaintiff 45 days&#32;in which to file an amended complaint. In October 2012, the Court entered a stipulated order consolidating the actions and staying all proceedings pending the plaintiffs' decision whether to file a consolidated complaint after the Firm completes its response to a demand submitted by one of the plaintiffs under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.204The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm's compliance with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration's Direct Endorsement Program. The Firm is cooperating in that investigation.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Purported class action lawsuits and individual actions were filed against JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns, as well as numerous other providers and brokers, alleging antitrust violations in the market for financial instruments related to municipal bond offerings referred to collectively as &#8220;municipal derivatives.&#8221; The municipal derivatives actions were consolidated and/or coordinated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Court approved a settlement of the class action pursuant to which the Firm paid $43 million. Certain class members opted out of the settlement, including 27&#32;plaintiffs named in individual actions already pending against JPMorgan.In addition, civil actions have been commenced against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the &#8220;County&#8221;) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. There are currently three civil actions pending in Alabama state court or the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama: (1) an action by the County against the Firm and several other defendants alleging that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion&#32;in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County and that, but for the concealment of these payments, the County would not have entered into the transactions; (2) an action on behalf of a purported class of sewer rate payers based on the same allegations as in the County's action; and (3) an adversary proceeding&#32;by&#32;different representatives of a purported class of sewer ratepayers seeking to void $1.6 billion&#32;of warrants issued by the County as allegedly unlawful, which initially included the Firm as a defendant but more recently has dropped any claims against the Firm.&#160; All of these actions have been stayed. Two&#32;insurance companies that guaranteed the payment of principal and interest on warrants issued by the County have filed separate actions against the Firm in New York state court. Their complaints assert that the Firm fraudulently misled them into issuing insurance based upon substantially the same alleged conduct described above and other alleged non-disclosures. One insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of nearly $1.2 billion&#32;and seeks unspecified damages in excess of $400 million&#32;as well as unspecified punitive damages. The other insurer claims that it insured an aggregate principal amount of more than $378 million&#32;and seeks recovery of $4 million&#32;allegedly paid under the policies to date as well as any future payments and unspecified punitive damages. Both of these actions are also currently stayed.In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment (&#8220;Plan of Adjustment&#8221;) under which the County &nbsp;action and the insurance company actions referenced above would be dismissed with prejudice, and individuals seeking to assert claims on behalf of the County, including the sewer rate payers who previously filed actions described above, would be permanently enjoined from pursuing those claims. In August 2013, the Bankruptcy Court approved the County's disclosure statement and authorized the County to solicit votes on its Plan of Adjustment.&#160;The confirmation hearing in respect of the Plan is scheduled for November 2013.&#160; If confirmed, the Plan of Adjustment sets forth various conditions to the occurrence of the effective date, including that the effective date occur before the end of 2013.Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage Litigation. The Firm has reached an agreement to settle one&#32;purported and three&#32;certified class actions, all pending in federal courts in California, which assert that several JPMorgan Chase entities violated the federal Truth in Lending Act and state unfair business practice statutes in failing to provide adequate disclosures in Option Adjustable Rate Mortgage (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) loans regarding the resetting of introductory interest rates and that negative amortization was certain to occur if a borrower made the minimum monthly payment. Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (&#8220;OEP&#8221;), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, &#8220;Petters&#8221;) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three&#32;Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid, on fraudulent transfer and preference grounds, certain purported transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees.Securities Lending Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in a putative class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York brought by participants in the Firm's securities lending business. The action relates to investments by ERISA clients of more than $200 million&#32;in Lehman Brothers medium-term notes. The Court denied the Firm's motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, and scheduled a trial to begin February 2014.Sworn Documents and Collection Litigation Practices. The Firm has been responding to formal and informal inquiries from various state and federal regulators regarding practices involving credit card collections litigation (including with respect to sworn documents), the sale of 205consumer credit card debt and securities backed by credit card receivables. The OCC has advised Chase Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Bank and Trust Company, N.A. (&#8220;Chase&#8221;) of its determination to seek an administrative order with respect to Chase's past oversight of third parties, operational processes and control functions related to collections litigation practices, the execution and notarization of sworn documents and compliance with Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and Chase's sales of consumer credit card debt. The CFPB is conducting an investigation into Chase's collection and sale of consumer credit card debt, including, but not limited to, its use of sworn documents in these processes. In May 2013, the California Attorney General filed a civil action in California state court against JPMorgan Chase & Co., Chase Bank USA, N.A. and Chase BankCard Services, Inc. alleging violations of California law relating to the use of sworn documents in various stages of the debt collection process, including but not limited to verification of credit card collection complaints, default motions and judgment sales. The Firm has moved to dismiss the complaint. Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual's failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC, asserting an estimated $6 billion&#32;to $10 billion&#32;in damages based upon alleged breach of various mortgage securitization agreements and alleged violation of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual, Inc. (&#8220;WMI&#8221;) subsidiaries in connection with those securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase may have assumed liabilities for alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. The District Court denied as premature motions by the Firm and the FDIC that sought a ruling on whether the FDIC retained liability for Deutsche Bank's claims. Discovery is underway.In addition, JPMorgan Chase was sued in an action originally filed in state court in Texas (the &#8220;Texas Action&#8221;) by certain holders of WMI common stock and debt of WMI and Washington Mutual Bank who seek unspecified damages alleging that JPMorgan Chase acquired substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC at a price that was allegedly too low. The Texas Action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which ultimately granted JPMorgan Chase's and the FDIC's motions to dismiss the complaint, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the District Court's dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. Plaintiffs, who sue now only as holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt following their voluntary dismissal of claims brought as holders of WMI common stock and debt, have filed an amended complaint alleging that JPMorgan Chase caused the closure of Washington Mutual Bank and damaged them by causing their bonds issued by Washington Mutual Bank, which had a total face value of $38 million, to lose &nbsp;substantially all of their value. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs' claim that the Firm tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs' bond contracts with Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closure. Discovery is underway.* * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. The Firm accrues for potential liability arising from such proceedings when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downwards, as appropriate, based on management's best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm incurred litigation expense of $678 million&#32;and $323 million&#32;during the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $1.0 billion&#32;and $3.0 billion&#32;during the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.206Note 24 &#8211; Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. The business segment financial results presented reflect the current organization of JPMorgan Chase. There are four&#32;major reportable business segments &#8211; Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase's business segments, see Business Segment Results on pages 17&#8211;18&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and pages 78&#8211;79 and Note 33 on pages 326&#8211;329 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012 Annual Report.&nbsp;Segment resultsThe following tables provide a summary of the Firm's segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).Effective January 1, 2013, the Firm further refined the capital allocation framework to align it with the revised line of business structure that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses is largely driven by regulatory guidance on Basel III requirements, principally for CIB and CIO, and by anticipated business growth. 207208Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.:We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of June&#160;30, 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, for the three-month and six-month periods ended June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and June&#160;30, 2012, and the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the six-month periods ended June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and June&#160;30, 2012, included in the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June&#160;30, 2013. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm's management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.&nbsp;We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December&#160;31, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 28, 2013, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the consolidated balance sheet information as of December&#160;31, 2012, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.August 7, 2013PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017209JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates(Taxable-equivalent interest and rates; in millions, except rates)210JPMorgan Chase & Co.Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates(Taxable-equivalent interest and rates; in millions, except rates)211Allowance for loan losses to total loans: Represents period-end allowance for loan losses divided by retained loans.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: Represents the interest of third-party holders of debt, equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates.Benefit obligation: Refers to the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans.Contractual credit card charge-off: In accordance with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council policy, nonmodified credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, while modified credit card loans are charged off when the account becomes 120 days past due. In addition, all credit card loans must be charged off within 60 days from receiving notification about certain specified events (e.g., bankruptcy of the borrower).Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay by, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) Determinations Committee.Credit cycle: A period of time over which credit quality improves, deteriorates and then improves again (or vice versa). The duration of a credit cycle can vary from a couple of years to several years.CUSIP number: A CUSIP (i.e., Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number consists of nine characters (including letters and numbers) that uniquely identify a company or issuer and the type of security and is assigned by the American Bankers Association and operated by Standard & Poor's. This system facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities. A similar system is used to identify non- U.S. securities (CUSIP International Numbering System).Exchange traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.FICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk provided by credit bureaus, typically produced from statistical models &nbsp;by Fair Isaac Corporation utilizing data collected by the credit bureaus.Forward points: Represents the interest rate differential between two currencies, which is either added to or subtracted from the current exchange rate (i.e., &#8220;spot rate&#8221;) to determine the forward exchange rate.Group of Seven (&#8220;G7&#8221;) nations: Countries in the G7 are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.G7 government bonds: Bonds issued by the government of one of countries in the G7 nations.Headcount-related expense: Includes salary and benefits (excluding performance-based incentives), and other noncompensation costs related to employees.Home equity - senior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JP Morgan Chase holds the first security interest on the property.Home equity - junior lien: Represents loans and commitments where JP Morgan Chase holds a security interest that is subordinate in rank to other liens.Interchange income: A fee paid to a credit card issuer in the clearing and settlement of a sales or cash advance transaction.Investment-grade: An indication of credit quality based on JPMorgan Chase's internal risk assessment system. &#8220;Investment grade&#8221; generally represents a risk profile similar to a rating of a &#8220;BBB-&#8221;/&#8220;Baa3&#8221; or better, as defined by S&P and Moody's.LLC: Limited Liability Company.Loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.Origination date LTV ratioThe LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.Current estimated LTV ratioAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (&#8220;MSA&#8221;) level. These MSA-level home price indices comprise actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.212Combined LTV ratioThe LTV ratio considering all lien positions related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non- GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts, as well as cash collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or termination of any one contract.Mortgage product types:Alt-AAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high combined loan-to-value (&#8220;CLTV&#8221;) ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.Option ARMsThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.PrimePrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records and a monthly income at least three to four times greater than their monthly housing expense (mortgage payments plus taxes and other debt payments). &nbsp;These borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.SubprimeSubprime loans are loans to customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower's primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.NA: Data is not applicable or available for the periodpresented.Net charge-off rate: Represents net charge-offs (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.NM: Not meaningful.Over the counter derivatives (&#8220;OTC&#8221;): Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.Over the counter cleared derivatives (&#8220;OTC cleared&#8221;): Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.Participating securities: Represents unvested stock-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, &#8220;dividends&#8221;), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.Portfolio activity: Describes changes to the risk profile of existing lending-related exposures and their impact on the allowance for credit losses from changes in customer profiles and inputs used to estimate the allowances.Pre-provision profit: Represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.213Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue includes realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivatives, other financial instruments, private equity investments, and physical commodities used in market making and client-driven activities. In addition, Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk management activities including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specified risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, and (c) other derivatives, including the synthetic credit portfolio.Purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) loans: Represents loans that were acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The guidance allows purchasers to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics (e.g., product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due status, geographic location). A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows.Real assets: Real assets include investments in productive assets such as agriculture, energy rights, mining and timber properties and exclude raw land to be developed for real estate purposes.Receivables from customers: Primarily represents margin loans to prime and retail brokerage customers which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the wholesale lines of business.Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.Retained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).Risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;): Risk-weighted assets consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. On-balance sheet assets are risk-weighted based on the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor or counterparty, the nature of any collateral, and the guarantor, if any. Off-balance sheet assets such as lending-related commitments, guarantees, derivatives and other applicable off-balance sheet positions are risk-weighted by multiplying the contractual amount by the appropriate credit conversion factor to determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount, which is then risk-weighted based on the same factors used for on-balance sheet assets. Risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk related to applicable trading assets-debt and equity instruments, and foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. The resulting &nbsp;risk-weighted values for each of the risk categories are then aggregated to determine total risk-weighted assets.Short sale: A short sale is a sale of real estate in which proceeds from selling the underlying property are less than the amount owed the Firm under the terms of the related mortgage and the related lien is released upon receipt of such proceeds.Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed results, the total net revenue for each of the business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities; the corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense.Trade-date and settlement-date: For financial instruments, the date that an order to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire an instrument is executed in the market. The trade-date may differ from the settlement-date, which is the date on which the actual transfer of a financial instrument between two parties is executed. The amount of time that passes between the trade-date and the settlement-date differs depending on the financial instrument. For repurchases under the common equity repurchase program, except where the trade-date is specified, the amounts disclosed are presented on a settlement-date basis. In the Capital Management section on pages 60&#8211;64, of this Form 10-Q, and where otherwise specified, repurchases under the common equity repurchase program are presented on a trade-date basis because the trade-date is used to calculate the Firm's regulatory capital.Troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.Unaudited: Financial statements and information that have not been subjected to auditing procedures sufficient to permit an independent certified public accountant to express an opinion.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in theUnited States of America.U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations:Obligations of agencies originally established or chartered by the U.S. government to serve public purposes as specified by the U.S. Congress; these obligations are not explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.U.S. Treasury: U.S. Department of the Treasury.Value-at-risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;): A measure of the dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment.Washington Mutual transaction: On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain of the assets of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (&#8220;Washington Mutual&#8221;) from the FDIC.214CONSUMER & COMMUNITY BANKING (&#8220;CCB&#8221;)Active online customers - Users of all internet browsers and mobile platforms who have been active in the past 90 days.Active mobile customers - Users of all mobile platforms, which include: SMS, mobile smartphone and tablet, who have been active in the past 90 days.Consumer & Business Banking (&#8220;CBB&#8221;)Description of selected business metrics within CBB:Client investment managed accounts - Assets actively managed by Chase Wealth Management on behalf of clients.

Borrowers are frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders or other third parties.Wholesale - Third-party mortgage brokers refer loan application packages to the Firm. The Firm then underwrites and funds the loan. Brokers are independent loan originators that specialize in counseling applicants on available home financing options, but do not provide funding for loans.

Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls in the future. For further information, see &#8220;Management's report on internal control over financial reporting&#8221; on page 186 of JPMorgan Chase's 2012&#32;Annual Report. There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&#160;13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm's internal control over financial reporting.217Part II Other InformationItem&#160;1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Legal ProceedingsFor information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part&#160;I, Item&#160;3: Legal Proceedings, in the Firm's 2012&#32;Annual Report on Form 10-K, see the discussion of the Firm's material litigation in Note 23 on pages 198&#8211;206&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Item 1A&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Risk FactorsFor a discussion of certain risk factors affecting the Firm,see Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 8&#8211;21 of JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K&#32;for the year ended December&#160;31, 2012; and Forward-Looking Statements on page 107&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Item 2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsDuring the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, there were no shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.&#32;issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof.Repurchases under the common equity repurchase programOn March&#160;13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion&#32;common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. The Firm repurchased (on a trade-date basis) shares of common stock of 24 million&#32;for $1.2 billion, and 27 million&#32;for $1.1 billion, during the three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, and 78 million&#32;for $3.8 billion, and 31 million&#32;for $1.3 billion, during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. The Firm did not repurchase any warrants during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013. The Firm repurchased 18 million&#32;warrants for $238 million&#32;during both the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2012. As of &nbsp;June&#160;30, 2013, $9.6 billion&#32;(on a trade-date basis) of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the program.Pursuant to CCAR, the Firm is authorized to repurchase up to $6 billion&#32;of common equity between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. Such repurchases are being done pursuant to the $15.0&#160;billion&#32;common equity repurchase program.The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity &#8212; for example, during internal trading &#8220;black-out periods.&#8221; All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information.The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management's discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.Shares repurchased, on a settlement-date basis, pursuant to the common equity repurchase program during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2013, were as follows.218<hr
