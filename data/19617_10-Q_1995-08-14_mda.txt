Part IItem 2 (continued)OVERVIEW--------Chemical Banking Corporation (the "Corporation") reported net income of $453million for the 1995 second quarter, an increase of 27% from earnings of $357million reported for the second quarter of 1994. The Corporation's primaryearnings per share increased 35% to $1.72 per share in the 1995 second quarter,compared with primary earnings of $1.27 per share in the second quarter of 1994.For the first six months of 1995, the Corporation's net income was $838 million,an increase of 24% from $676 million for the first half of 1994. Primaryearnings per share for the 1995 first six months was up 33% to $3.17 per share,compared with primary earnings of $2.39 per share in the comparable period of1994.The Corporation's results for the 1995 second quarter and first six monthsreflect continued progress on the Corporation's performance initiatives toincrease its earnings per share and achieve a higher return on shareholders'equity and an improved efficiency ratio. The Corporation's core earningscontinued to improve, led by revenue growth in certain nationwide consumer andcorporate finance businesses. Additionally, by managing expenses in line withrevenue opportunities, the Corporation also achieved an 11% improvement in thecore operating margin.During the 1995 second quarter, the Corporation increased the quarterly dividendon the outstanding shares of its common stock to 50 cents a share, an increaseof 14% from 44 cents per common share. On an annual basis, this represents anincrease in the dividend rate to $2.00 per share from $1.76 per share. Theincrease marked the fourth time the dividend has been increased since March1993, for a total increase of 66.6%.The Corporation's return on average common stockholders' equity was 17.7% forthe second quarter of 1995, compared with 13.9% for the 1994 comparable quarter.For the first six months, the Corporation's return on average commonstockholders' equity was 16.6% in 1995, compared with 13.1% in 1994. At June 30,1995, the Corporation's ratios of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets andTotal Capital to risk-weighted assets were 8.00% and 11.90%, respectively, wellin excess of the minimum ratios specified by the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board"). At June 30, 1995, theCorporation was "well capitalized" as defined by the Federal Reserve Board.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at June 30, 1995 were $1,118 million,down from $1,139 million at December 31, 1994 and a decline of $1,375 millionfrom $2,493 million at June 30, 1994. Nonperforming assets have declined by$5,469 million, or 83%, from their peak level of $6,587 million in September1992.In the second quarter of 1995, the Corporation adopted Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards, No. 122, "Accounting for Mortgage Servicing Rights" ("SFAS122") related to the accounting for originated mortgage servicing rights and, asa result, the Corporation recognized an immaterial gain during the quarter. - 20 - Part IItem 2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONS---------------------NET INTEREST INCOMENet interest income for the second quarter of 1995 was $1,162 million, comparedwith $1,185 million for the same period in 1994. For the first six months, netinterest income was $2,318 million in 1995, compared with $2,328 million in1994. The decreases from both 1994 periods were primarily due to narrower loanspreads experienced in 1995 partly offset by an increase in interest-earningassets (including growth in consumer loans), and the favorable impact of thedecrease in nonperforming loans. The following tables reflect the composition ofinterest-earning assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets and thenet yield on interest-earning assets for the periods indicated. - 21 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The Corporation's average total loans in the 1995 second quarter and first sixmonths increased by $7.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, from thecomparable 1994 periods. The increases reflected the continued growth inconsumer loans (principally from residential mortgage and credit cardactivities) and commercial lending, partially offset by a reduction in thecommercial real estate portfolio. Commercial loans outstandings at June 30, 1995represented the fourth consecutive quarterly increase since the June 30, 1994level reflecting an upward trend in commercial lending activity. For theremainder of 1995, the Corporation expects continued growth in its loanportfolio, with its consumer loans continuing to grow faster than its commercialloans. For a further discussion of the Corporation's loans, see the loanportfolio section on page 35.The negative impact on net interest income from nonperforming loans (excludingnonperforming loans held for accelerated disposition) in the second quarter of1995 was $17 million, compared with $38 million in the same quarter in 1994. Forthe first six months, the negative impact was $37 million in 1995, compared with$57 million in 1994. The improvement in both 1995 periods is principally due tothe significant reduction in the level of the Corporation's nonperforming loans.The favorable impact on net interest income from the Corporation'sasset/liability derivative activities, whereby derivative instruments are usedin order to alter the yield on certain of the Corporation's assets andliabilities, was immaterial for the second quarter of 1995, compared with $59million for the second quarter of 1994. For the first six months, the favorableimpact was approximately $16 million in 1995, compared with $119 million in1994. For a further discussion of derivative instruments used in theCorporation's asset/liability management activities, see Note 12 of the Notes toFinancial Statements and the Asset/Liability Management section on pages 45-46of this Form 10-Q.The decreases in the interest rate spread and the net yield for both 1995periods reflected narrower loan spreads and the impact of higher interest rateson wholesale funding, partially offset by wider deposit spreads and an increasedcontribution from noninterest-bearing funds. The contribution from interest-freefunds to the net yield was 75 basis points in the 1995 second quarter, anincrease from a 53 basis point contribution in the comparable 1994 period. Theimprovement from the prior year is due to the higher interest rate environmentduring 1995 and an increase of $1.6 billion in interest-free funds in the secondquarter of 1995. - 22 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Despite its outlook for continued loan growth in 1995, management anticipatesthat net interest income over the next two quarters will be relatively flatwith 1995 second quarter results and that net interest income for full year 1995will approximate or be somewhat lower than the 1994 full year level.For additional information on average balances and net interest income, seeAverage Consolidated Balance Sheet, Interest and Rates on pages 51-52.PROVISION FOR LOSSESThe Corporation's provision for losses was $120 million for the 1995 secondquarter, down from $160 million in the 1994 second quarter. For the first sixmonths, the provision for losses was $240 million in 1995 compared with $365million in 1994.As a result of management's evaluation of the continuing improvement in theCorporation's credit profile, the quarterly provision for losses during theremainder of 1995 is expected to be generally consistent with the 1995 secondquarter level.NONINTEREST REVENUEThe increase in noninterest revenue for the 1995 second quarter and first sixmonths when compared with the corresponding 1994 periods primarily reflectedhigher corporate finance and syndication fees and higher other revenue,partially offset by lower trading revenue. Securities gains were higher in the1995 second quarter versus the prior year period.Trust and investment management fees are primarily comprised of corporate,institutional and private banking (personal trust) activities provided tocorporations and individuals on a global basis. The following table presents thecomponents of trust and investment management fees for the periods indicated. - 23 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Trust and investment management fees for the 1995 second quarter were $97million, a decline of $11 million from the prior year period. Corporate andinstitutional trust fees in the 1995 second quarter declined $12 million fromthe same period a year ago due entirely to the absence of approximately $13million in fees in 1995 related to the joint venture with Mellon BankCorporation. As a result of the agreement between the Corporation and MellonBank Corporation relating to the shareholder services joint venture, effectiveJanuary 1, 1995 revenues and expenses of the business units contributed to thejoint venture were reflected on an equity basis within other revenue.Corporate finance and syndication fees were $129 million in the 1995 secondquarter, an increase of 39% from the prior year period. For the first sixmonths of 1995, such fees increased 42% from the comparable 1994 period. Theincreases from both 1994 periods reflect continued strong growth in loansyndications and high-yield securities underwritings. During the first half of1995, the Corporation acted as agent or co-agent for approximately $207 billionof syndicated credit facilities, a reflection of the Corporation's large clientbase and strong emphasis on distribution. Management expects the strong activitylevel in the loan syndication marketplace to continue throughout the remainderof 1995.The following table sets forth the components of fees for other banking servicesfor the periods indicated.The higher level of credit card services revenue for both 1995 periods reflectedincreased volume of retail credit cards from a growing cardholder base,primarily as a result of the Corporation's co-branded Shell MasterCard program.Outstandings in the credit card lending portfolio were $10.1 billion at June 30,1995, compared with $7.8 billion at the same date a year ago.Mortgage servicing fees increased $5 million in the 1995 second quarter and $12million in the first six months of 1995 from the prior year levels, reflecting ahigher level of mortgage servicing volume as a result of the acquisition ofMargaretten Financial Corporation ("Margaretten") on July 1, 1994.Fees in lieu of compensating balances decreased by $2 million in the 1995 secondquarter and by $13 million in the first six months of 1995 when compared withthe corresponding 1994 periods. Customers often pay for cash management or otherbanking services by maintaining noninterest-bearing deposits. As interest ratesincrease, the required compensating balance for a given level of service willdecrease. As a result, during the first six months of 1995, when interest rateswere higher than in the first six months of 1994, a greater volume of customersmaintained a compensating balance in lieu of paying a fee. - 24 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table sets forth the components of trading revenue for the secondquarter and first six months of 1995 and 1994.The decrease in revenue from interest rate contracts was due to unexpectedincreases in certain European interest rates (particularly in the U.K.). Foreignexchange revenue in 1995 continued to benefit from volatility in the currencymarkets. Debt instrument revenue for the 1995 second quarter, when compared withthe same 1994 period, primarily reflected an improvement in prices of emergingmarkets debt instruments during the 1995 second quarter. The decrease in debtinstrument revenue for the first six months of 1995, when compared with the same1994 period, was due to major declines in the prices of emerging markets debtinstruments that occurred during the 1995 first quarter.Trading revenues are affected by many factors including volatility of currenciesand interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by the Corporation onbehalf of its customers, the Corporation's success in proprietary positioning,and the steps taken by central banks and governments which affect financialmarkets. The Corporation believes that its trading business is a significantcore business and that its improved credit standing has improved theCorporation's trading capabilities by enabling the Corporation to utilize awider array of products with additional counterparties. However, the Corporationexpects that its trading revenues will fluctuate as factors, such as marketvolatility, governmental actions, or success in proprietary positioning, varyfrom period to period.Securities gains were $69 million in the 1995 second quarter, compared withgains of $13 million in the same period last year. The higher level ofsecurities gains from the available-for-sale portfolio reflected theCorporation's ability to take advantage of favorable bond market conditions. Forthe first six months, securities gains were $51 million in 1995, as comparedwith $59 million in 1994. Included in the 1995 six month results was a $13million permanent impairment loss on Barings Bank PLC securities held by theCorporation and an $11 million loss on sales of available-for-sale securities atChemical Bank New Jersey undertaken as part of the repositioning of theremaining branches in anticipation of the sale of the bank to PNC. For furtherdiscussion of the Corporation's securities, see Note 3 - Securities of the Notesto Financial Statements. For a further discussion of the sale of Chemical BankNew Jersey, see page 50. - 25 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the composition of other noninterest revenue forthe second quarter and first six months of 1995 and 1994.Revenue from equity-related investments, which includes income from venturecapital activities and emerging markets investments, was $126 million in the1995 second quarter compared with $66 million in the same 1994 period. For thefirst half of 1995, revenue from equity-related investments was $233 million, a56% increase from the comparable 1994 period. Average revenue fromequity-related investments was approximately $91 million per quarter, based onrevenues during the last eight quarterly periods. At June 30, 1995, theCorporation had equity-related investments with a carrying value of $1.9billion. The Corporation believes that equity-related investments will continueto make contributions to the Corporation's earnings, although the timing of therecognition of gains from such activities is unpredictable and it is expectedthat revenues from such activities will vary significantly from period toperiod.The second quarter of 1995 included a loss of approximately $50 million relatedto the disposition of emerging market securities previously recorded asavailable-for-sale. - 26 - Part IItem 2 (continued) Noninterest expense in the 1995 second quarter was $1,248 million, comparedwith $1,246 million in the 1995 first quarter and $1,281 million in the secondquarter of 1994. For the first six months, noninterest expense was $2,494million in 1995, compared with $2,557 million in 1994 (which amount excludes a$48 million restructuring charge). The improvement from the prior year reflectsthe benefits of various expense efforts as part of the Corporation's actions toimprove earnings per share. Additionally, as a result of the shareholderservices joint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation, approximately $29 millionof expenses associated with the stock transfer and related shareholder servicingoperations for the first six months of 1995 are being recorded on an equitybasis within noninterest revenue. The decrease in noninterest expense waspartially offset by the inclusion of $53 million of noninterest expenses in thefirst six months of 1995 relating to Margaretten, which was acquired in July1994.The increases in salaries for the 1995 second quarter and first six months wereprimarily due to additional staff costs resulting from the 1994 Margarettenacquisition and the continued growth in the Corporation's securitiesunderwriting business. These increases were partially offset by the impact ofpersonnel reductions undertaken in 1995 and lower salaries expense as a resultof the equity accounting for the joint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation.Total staff at June 30, 1995 amounted to 40,992, compared with the 1994 year-endlevel of 42,130 (which included 1,423 staff from the Margaretten acquisition)and the June 30, 1994 level of 40,988. At June 30, 1995, the Corporation haseliminated approximately half of the 3,700 positions that it had targeted forelimination as part of its actions to improve earnings per share announced inDecember 1994.Employee benefits expense in the second quarter of 1995 was $117 million,compared with $102 million in the same 1994 period. For the first six months of1995, employee benefits expense was $224 million, compared with $221 million inthe first half of 1994. The increases primarily resulted from higher retirementplan expense as well as higher OPEB expense.Occupancy expense in the 1995 second quarter and first six months decreased by$11 million and by $22 million, respectively, from the prior year's comparableperiods. The declines for both periods are largely the result of theconsolidation of headquarters, operational and branch facilities together withthe impact of divestitures and other expense reduction initiatives. Thesedeclines are partially offset by the inclusion of Margaretten's expense sincethe acquisition date.The higher level of equipment expense in both 1995 periods was primarily theresult of continued technology enhancements to support the Corporation'sinvestment in certain key businesses (in particular its trading and consumerbanking businesses) and the inclusion of Margaretten's results subsequent to theJuly 1, 1994 acquisition.Foreclosed property expense in the 1995 second quarter was a credit of $14million, compared with an expense of $2 million in the second quarter of 1994.For the first six months, foreclosed property expense was a credit of $21million in 1995, compared with an expense of $37 million in 1994. The decreasesreflect significant progress in managing the Corporation's real estateportfolio. Included in the 1995 amounts were payments received at Texas CommerceEquity Holdings Inc. ("Texas Commerce") related to certain foreclosed propertiespreviously written down. - 27 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the components of other expense for the periodsindicated.Other expense for the 1995 second quarter was $362 million, a decrease of $42million, or 10%, from the same period in 1994. For the first six months of 1995,other expense decreased $52 million when compared with 1994. The 1995 six-monthamount included operating costs of approximately $28 million relating toMargaretten and excluded approximately $12 million of expenses relating to thejoint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation. Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation ("FDIC") assessments decreased 12% from the 1994 first six monthslevel reflecting a lower domestic deposit base. The Corporation expects furtherdecreases in FDIC assessments in 1995, in light of a recent announcement by theFDIC that it intends to reduce the premiums to be paid by banks to the BankInsurance Fund. All other expenses, which includes various smaller expensecategories such as stationery, operating losses, postage, shipping, travel andinsurance, decreased by $45 million, or 12%, in the first six months of 1995,primarily as a result of the Corporation's aggressive sourcing and other expensereduction initiatives. Partially offsetting these decreases were highertelecommunications expenses, primarily attributable to higher market dataservices.The Corporation announced on December 1, 1994 that, as a result of the expensereduction initiatives undertaken at that time, it was targeting noninterestexpense in each of 1995 and 1996 to be flat with full year 1994. At the currenttime, the Corporation believes that 1995 and 1996 noninterest expense will beapproximately equal to or less than 1994 noninterest expense.The Corporation's efficiency ratio (excluding restructuring charges, foreclosedproperty expense, emerging markets-related past-due interest bond sales and thegain from the sale of the Corporation's investment in Far East Bank and TrustCompany) was 59.4% in the 1995 second quarter, compared with 62.3% in the same1994 period. This ratio for the first six months of 1995 was 61.9%, comparedwith 61.7% for the first six months of 1994. The Corporation remains committedto improving its operating margins and return levels and to achieving anefficiency ratio of 60% in 1995 and 57% in 1996.The Corporation is managing its expenses in line with its revenue opportunitiesand is benefiting from the implementation of its expense reduction initiatives.As a result, the Corporation currently believes it is in a position to achievethe efficiency ratio and other performance goals announced on December 1, 1994.INCOME TAXESThe Corporation recorded income tax expense of $302 million in the 1995 secondquarter, compared with $254 million in the comparable 1994 period. For the firstsix months, the Corporation recorded income tax expense of $566 million in 1995,compared with $480 million in 1994. The Corporation's effective tax rate was40.0% in the second quarter and the first six months of 1995, compared with41.5% in the respective 1994 periods. - 28 - Part IItem 2 (continued)BUSINESS ORGANIZATION---------------------The Corporation conducts domestic and international financial servicesbusinesses through various bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The principal banksubsidiaries of the Corporation are Chemical Bank and Texas Commerce BankNational Association.LINES-OF-BUSINESS RESULTSProfitability of the Corporation is tracked with an internal managementinformation system that produces lines-of- business performance for all sectors.A set of management accounting policies has been developed and implemented toensure that the reported results of the groups reflect the economics of theirbusinesses. Lines- of-business results are subject to restatement as appropriatewhenever there are refinements in management reporting policies or changes tothe management organization. Lines-of-business results are subject to furtherrestatements as may be necessary to reflect future changes in internalmanagement reporting.Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred bybusinesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating shareholders'equity and the provision for losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology.Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to the businessunits except for special corporate one-time charges. Management has developed arisk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different types of risk --credit, operating and market -- within various businesses and assigns capitalaccordingly. Credit risk is computed using a risk grading system that isconsistently applied throughout the Corporation. A long-term expected tax rateis assigned in evaluating the Corporation's businesses.Commencing with the first quarter of 1995, Texas Commerce is being reported on amanagement accounting basis instead of a legal entity basis. The 1994 resultsfor Texas Commerce have been restated to conform to the current presentation. - 29 -  - 30 -  - 31 - Part IItem 2 (continued)GLOBAL BANKThe Global Bank is currently organized into three principal management units;Global Banking & Investment Banking (client management, loan syndications andportfolio investments; high yield finance, venture capital; mergers andacquisitions and other advisory services); Global Markets (foreign exchangedealing; derivatives trading and structuring, risk management and sales;securities structuring, underwriting, trading and sales; and management of theCorporation's funding and securities investment activities); and OtherInternational (all wholesale banking; investment banking; markets and otheractivities outside of the United States and the major cross-border financialcenters). Also, included are the Corporation's "terminal businesses" whichrepresent discontinued portfolios, especially refinancing country debt. TheGlobal Bank seeks to optimize its risk profile and profitability by emphasizingoriginations, underwriting, distribution and risk management products.The Global Bank's net income in the second quarter of 1995 was $235 million, anincrease of $29 million from the second quarter of 1994. The sector's return onequity in the second quarter of 1995 was 22.6% compared with 19.2% in the 1994second quarter. The improvement in the 1995 second quarter results was primarilydue to increases in noninterest revenue from corporate finance and syndicationfees, revenue from equity-related investments, and securities gains, partiallyoffset by a decrease in trading revenue. The Global Bank's net income of $471million and return on equity of 22.7% for the first six months of 1995 increasedfrom last year's six month results of $439 million and 20.4%, respectively. Theincrease in the 1995 six month results reflects higher fees from corporatefinance and syndications and the gain related to the sale of the Corporation'sinvestment in Far East Bank and Trust Company, partially offset by lower tradingrevenue.The following table sets forth the significant components of Global Bank's totalrevenue by business for the periods indicated.Total revenue for the Global Bank increased $50 million in the second quarterand $18 million for the first half of 1995, when compared with the same periodslast year. Revenue for Global Banking & Investment Banking increased in the 1995second quarter and 1995 first half by $117 million and $165 million,respectively, when compared with the same periods in 1994. The increases fromlast year were primarily due to increased revenue from equity-relatedinvestments of $58 million in the 1995 second quarter and $81 million for thefirst half of 1995 and increased fee revenue as a result of the Corporation'sleading market share in the loan syndication business.Contributing to the revenue declines in Global Markets were trading revenueswhich decreased by $54 million in the 1995 second quarter (partially offset byhigher emerging markets trading revenue) and $176 million for the first sixmonths of 1995 reflecting higher interest rates and unexpected volatileconditions in both domestic and foreign trading markets. The decrease in revenuefrom last year was also affected by lower net interest income due to highershort-term interest rates in 1995. These decreases in the second quarter of 1995were partially offset by an increase in securities gains.Revenue for Other International increased $40 million compared with last year'ssecond quarter. For the first six months of 1995, revenue for OtherInternational increased $140 million compared with 1994. Increased commercialloan volume and improved interest rate environments, primarily in Latin America,increased net interest income by $14 million in the second quarter and by $28million for the first half of 1995, compared with the same periods in 1994.Trading revenue increased $25 million in the second quarter of 1995, primarilyin Europe, and $13 million for the first six months of 1995, split betweenEurope and Asia. Also contributing to the - 32 - Part IItem 2 (continued)increase in revenue for the first half of 1995 was the gain related to the saleof the Corporation's interest in Far East Bank and Trust Company.Revenue from the Corporation's "terminal businesses" decreased from 1994 levelsby $74 million in the second quarter and $110 million for the first six monthsof 1995, primarily due to decreases in net interest income and other revenue.Net interest income decreased $16 million in the second quarter of 1995 and $32million for the first six months compared with 1994, due to a decrease in loanoutstandings. The decrease in other revenue from last year was $57 million inthe second quarter of 1995 and primarily reflects a loss of approximately $50million related to the disposition of available-for-sale emerging marketssecurities. For the first six months of 1995, the decrease in other revenue was$75 million due to the absence of gains from emerging markets bond salescompared with 1994, partially offset by increased gains on the disposition ofemerging markets equity investments.REGIONAL BANKThe Regional Bank currently includes Metropolitan Banking (consumer banking andcommercial and professional banking); Retail Card Services; Mortgage Bank;National Consumer Finance (home secured lending, student lending, and otherconsumer lending); Middle Market (regional commercial banking); Private Banking;Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. and Geoserve (cash management, fundstransfer, trade, corporate trust and securities services worldwide). TheCorporation maintains a leading market share position in serving the financialneeds of middle market commercial enterprises and small businesses in the NewYork metropolitan area. Private Banking serves a high net-worth clientele withbanking, advisory and investment services.The Regional Bank's net income was $140 million in the second quarter of 1995, adecrease from last year's second quarter results of $145 million. The decreasein earnings was due to a higher credit provision of $19 million and lower netinterest income of $17 million, partially offset by higher noninterest revenueand lower noninterest expense of $26 million and $9 million, respectively. Forthe first six months of 1995, Regional Bank's net income was $256 million, anincrease of $6 million from the same period last year. The results for the firstsix months of 1994 included a $48 million restructuring charge ($28 millionafter-tax) related to the closing of 50 New York branches and a staff reductionof 650. Excluding the restructuring charge, Regional Bank's earnings for thefirst half of 1995 decreased by $22 million compared with the first half of 1994due to higher credit provision of $24 million and lower net interest income of$19 million, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue of $27 million. Thehigher credit provision at June 30, 1995 reflects the substantial growth incredit card outstandings.The following table sets forth the significant components of Regional Bank'stotal revenue by business for the periods indicated. - 33 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Metropolitan Banking had revenue of $274 million in the 1995 second quarter, a6% increase from the 1994 second quarter. For the first six months of 1995,Metropolitan Banking experienced revenue growth of $67 million, or 14%, comparedwith 1994. Improvement in both 1995 periods compared with last year's resultswere due to favorable deposit spreads, targeted customer segmentation andrepricing initiatives. Retail Card Services revenue increased $21 million, or9%, in the 1995 second quarter and $34 million, or 7%, for the first six monthsof 1995, compared with the same periods in 1994. An increase in Shell MasterCardoutstandings and resulting strong fee growth contributed to the upturn inrevenue. Total outstandings for Retail Card Services at the end of the secondquarter of 1995 were $10.1 billion compared with $7.8 billion at the end of thesecond quarter of 1994. The Mortgage Bank continues to be faced with competitiondue to industry overcapacity, which has adversely affected production this year.During the second quarter and first six months of 1995, the Mortgage Bankincreased revenues by 16% and 4%, respectively, when compared with the 1994second quarter and first six months, primarily due to higher servicing-relatedrevenues as a result of the acquisition of Margaretten. National ConsumerFinance revenues have remained relatively stable in the 1995 second quarter whencompared with 1994. National Consumer Finance outstandings have increased in thesecond quarter of 1995 by more than 20% over the second quarter of 1994;partially offsetting this favorable impact was a reduction in spreads.Middle Market revenues were essentially flat for the second quarter and firstsix months of 1995, when compared with the same periods in 1994. Middle Markethas experienced improved credit quality and favorable deposit spreads in 1995;however loan and deposit volumes have decreased primarily due to heightenedcompetition coupled with the higher interest rate environment. For the secondquarter of 1995, Private Banking revenue increased compared with last year. Thedecline in Private Banking revenue for the first six months of 1995, whencompared with the first six months of 1994, reflects the adverse impact of a $13million loss on the permanent impairment of Barings Bank PLC securities.Excluding the loss, Private Banking's revenues for the first half of 1995 wouldhave reflected a 7% increase over the same period in 1994. These positiveresults are attributable to continued loan and deposit growth, wider spreads andhigher fees generated by greater volume in the brokerage business for the secondquarter and first half of 1995. Revenue in Geoserve was essentially flat in thesecond quarter and first half of 1995 when compared with 1994. During thoseperiods, Treasury Management products experienced a 7% increase in revenueoffset by a decline in Global Securities and Trust revenue.TEXAS COMMERCETexas Commerce is a leader in providing financial products and services tobusinesses and individuals throughout Texas. Texas Commerce is the primary bankfor more large corporations and middle market companies than any other bank inTexas. As of June 30, 1995, Texas Commerce had $21 billion in total assets with120 locations statewide.Texas Commerce's net income in the second quarter of 1995 was $52 million, anincrease of 24% from last year's second quarter results of $42 million. For thefirst six months, Texas Commerce's net income increased to $103 million in 1995,compared with $76 million in 1994. The increases in the 1995 periods, whencompared with the corresponding 1994 periods, were primarily due to lowerforeclosed property expense, lower noninterest expense and higher net interestincome. The substantial decrease in foreclosed property expense is attributableto the improvement in the Texas real estate market and payments received relatedto certain foreclosed properties that were previously written down. Net interestincome rose $12 million in the 1995 first six months, when compared with the1994 first six months, due to a 13% growth in loan volume coupled with morefavorable interest rate spreads. The decreases in noninterest revenue duringthat period were due to declines in trust income, corporate finance andsyndications, and deposit servicing fees, partially offset by improved tradingresults.REAL ESTATEReal Estate includes the management of the Corporation's commercial real estateportfolio, primarily at Chemical Bank. Real Estate had net income of $3 millionfor the second quarter of 1995 and net income of $1 million for the first sixmonths of 1995, compared with net losses of $36 million and $77 million,respectively, for the same periods in 1994. The improvement in net income wasprimarily due to a decrease in credit provision and lower foreclosed propertyexpense reflecting the significant progress made in managing the Corporation'sreal estate - 34 - Part IItem 2 (continued)portfolio. Total nonperforming assets at June 30, 1995 were $166 million, adecline of 85% from $1,074 million at the same date a year ago. The improvementin nonperforming asset levels from last year is the result of increasedliquidity in the real estate markets and successful workout activities, coupledwith the strategic actions taken during 1994. For more information regardingsuch actions, reference is made to page B26 of the Corporation's 1994 Form10-K.CORPORATECorporate includes the management results attributed to the parent company; theCorporation's investment in CIT; and some effects remaining at the corporatelevel after the implementation of management accounting policies includingresidual credit provision and tax expense. Corporate had net income of $23million for the 1995 second quarter, an increase of $23 million from last year'ssecond quarter. For the first six months of 1995, Corporate had net income of $7million compared with a net loss of $12 million for the same period in 1994.Included in the net income of $7 million for the first half of 1995 was an $11million after-tax charge due to the adoption of SFAS 106 for foreign employeesand a $6 million write-down associated with certain nonperforming residentialmortgages.LOAN PORTFOLIO--------------The following loan review discussion focuses primarily on developments sinceDecember 31, 1994 and should be read in conjunction with the Loan Portfoliosection on pages B25 through B30 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 1994 (the "1994 Form 10-K").The Corporation's loans outstanding totaled $84.7 billion at June 30, 1995, anincrease of $5.9 billion from year-end 1994 and $10.0 billion higher than atJune 30, 1994. The growth in loans outstanding reflects increases in both theconsumer and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. For the remainder of1995, the Corporation expects continued growth in its loan portfolio.The Corporation's loan balances were as follows for the dates indicated: - 35 - Part IItem 2 (continued)NONPERFORMING ASSETSFor a description of the Corporation's accounting policies for its nonperformingloans, renegotiated loans and assets acquired as loan satisfactions, see NoteOne of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page B49 of theCorporation's 1994 Form 10-K.The Corporation's shared loss assets acquired from First City were $55 millionat June 30, 1995. Such assets are not included in the amount of nonperformingassets below. In July 1995, the Corporation sold all of its nonperforming sharedloss assets at book value and, as a result, the Corporation terminated itsagreement with the FDIC.The following table sets forth the nonperforming assets and contractually pastdue loans of the Corporation at June 30, 1995, December 31, 1994 and June 30,1994.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at June 30, 1995 were $1,118 million, adecrease of $21 million from the 1994 year-end level and a decrease of $1,375million, or 55%, from last year's comparable quarter. These reductions reflectthe improvement in the Corporation's credit profile as a result of a lower levelof loans being placed on nonperforming status, repayments, charge-offs, theCorporation's continuing loan workout and collection activities, as well as theimpact of several strategic actions undertaken during 1994. A discussion ofthese actions is provided on page B26 of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K.Management expects the level of the Corporation's nonperforming assets atyear-end 1995 will be at or moderately below the 1994 year-end level. - 36 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the reconciliation of nonperforming assets for thesecond quarter and first six months of 1995 and 1994.ASSETS HELD FOR ACCELERATED DISPOSITIONIn December 1994, the Corporation segregated approximately $735 million of realestate loans and real estate owned (approximately $580 million nonperformingassets) and designated such assets as Assets Held for Accelerated Disposition.In conjunction with the transfer of these real estate loans to the held foraccelerated disposition classification, the Corporation reevaluated its carryingvalues for these assets to facilitate their rapid disposition and recorded acharge of $148 million to the allowance for credit losses. As a result of thisaction, these assets were excluded from the June 30, 1995 and December 31, 1994nonperforming assets category.The following table represents the Corporation's assets held for accelerateddisposition at the dates indicated: - 37 - Part IItem 2 (continued)For a discussion of net charge-offs, see the various credit portfolio sectionsthat follow. As a result of management's evaluation of the continuingimprovement in the Corporation's credit profile, quarterly net charge-offsduring the remainder of 1995 are expected to be generally consistent with the1995 second quarter level. For a discussion of special charges the Corporationincurred in 1994, see page B27 of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K.DOMESTIC CONSUMER PORTFOLIOThe domestic consumer loan portfolio consists of one-to-four family residentialmortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans. The domestic consumer loanportfolio totaled $34.7 billion at June 30, 1995, representing 41% of totalloans, an increase from $30.1 billion, or 38% of total loans, at December 31,1994 and an increase from $26.7 billion, or 36% of total loans, at June 30,1994.Residential mortgage loans at June 30, 1995 increased $4.8 billion from thecomparable 1994 period-end, due in part to the Margaretten acquisition in July1994 as well as from increases in adjustable rate loan outstandings. Credit cardreceivables at June 30, 1995 increased $2.3 billion from the same date a yearago, primarily due to the co- branded Shell MasterCard program. Managementexpects continued growth in the level of Shell credit card outstandings for1995. Management is exploring other opportunities in the credit card area,including other co- branded card programs.Total nonperforming domestic consumer loans were $121 million at June 30, 1995,$104 million at December 31, 1994 and $165 million at June 30, 1994. Theincrease in nonperforming domestic consumer loans since December 31, 1994 isprimarily due to the increase in the volume of consumer loans.Domestic consumer loan balances are expected to continue to increase in 1995,particularly in the credit card and residential mortgage portfolios. As a resultof this anticipated growth, management expects consumer loan net charge-offs in1995 will be higher than in 1994, although the percentage of total consumer netcharge-offs to total consumer loan outstandings are expected to decline. - 38 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the composition of the Corporation's delinquentdomestic consumer loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more at thedates indicated and are still accruing. Such consumer loans are generally notclassified as nonperforming but, rather, are charged-off on a formula basis.MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIESThe Corporation both originates and services residential mortgage loans as partof its mortgage banking activities. After origination, the Corporation typicallysells loans to investors, primarily in the secondary market, while retaining therights to service such loans. The Corporation originated $3.1 billion ofresidential mortgages in the second quarter of 1995 versus $2.9 billion in thesame 1994 period. For the six months ended June 30, 1995, the Corporationoriginated $4.9 billion of residential mortgages, compared with $7.0 billion inthe same 1994 period. During the first six months of 1995, the Corporation soldto investors approximately 58% of the residential mortgage loans it hadoriginated, compared with 75% in same 1994 period. The Corporation's residentialmortgage servicing portfolio amounted to $54.7 billion at June 30, 1995,compared with $55.6 billion at December 31, 1994 and $40.3 billion at June 30,1994.In addition to originating mortgage servicing rights, the Corporation alsopurchases and sells mortgage servicing rights. The Corporation may purchase bulkrights to service a loan portfolio or the Corporation may purchase loansdirectly and then sell such loans while retaining the servicing rights. Asdisclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, theCorporation adopted SFAS 122 in the 1995 second quarter. SFAS 122 requires thatwhen a definitive plan exists to sell or securitize mortgage loans and retainthe servicing rights related thereto, a mortgage banking enterprise shouldrecognize as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others,irrespective of whether those servicing rights are acquired through the purchaseor origination of mortgage loans.Mortgage servicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $453 million atJune 30, 1995, compared with $469 million at December 31, 1994 and $293 millionat June 30, 1994. The increase in mortgage servicing rights at June 30, 1995,when compared with the same date a year-ago, was primarily due to theMargaretten acquisition, while the decrease from the 1994 year-end reflected theeffects of sales of mortgage servicing rights, amortization and impairmentreserves during the six month period. The Corporation utilizes an amortizationmethod based on adjusted cash flows to amortize mortgage servicing rights. Themortgage loans to which the Corporation's servicing rights relate are, to asubstantial degree, of recent vintage (i.e., originated in the period 1992through the first half of 1994 when interest rates were relatively low). TheCorporation continually evaluates prepayment exposure of the portfolio,adjusting the balance and remaining life of the servicing rights as a result ofprepayments. - 39 - Part IItem 2 (continued)DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIOThe domestic commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $21.8 billion at June30, 1995, an increase from $20.8 billion at December 31, 1994 and $19.6 billionat June 30, 1994. The portfolio is diversified geographically and by industry.The largest industry concentrations are oil and gas and retailing whichapproximate $2.0 billion (or 2.4% of total loans) and $1.8 billion (or 2.1% oftotal loans), respectively. All of the other remaining industries are each lessthan 2% of total loans.Included in the domestic commercial and industrial portfolio are loans relatedto highly leveraged transactions ("HLTs"). The Corporation originates andsyndicates loans in HLTs, which include acquisitions, leveraged buyouts andrecapitalizations. HLT loans at June 30, 1995 totaled approximately $1.5billion, up from $1.3 billion at the 1994 year-end but down from $1.6 billion atJune 30, 1994. The increase in the HLT loan portfolio from the 1994 year-endreflects a rise in the number of HLT transactions during the first half of 1995,while the decrease from June 30, 1994 can be largely attributed to repaymentsand reclassifications to non-HLT status. At June 30, 1995, the Corporation had$62 million in nonperforming HLT loans, compared with $82 million at the end of1994 and $182 million at June 30, 1994. Net recoveries related to HLTs for thefirst six months of 1995 totaled $9 million, compared with net charge-offs of $2million in the comparable 1994 period.The Corporation is a leading participant in loan originations and sales. Thisactivity is comprised of the sale of loans and lending commitments to investors,generally without recourse. These sales include syndication, assignment andparticipation, and include both short- and medium-term transactions. This loandistribution capability allows the Corporation to compete aggressively andprofitably in wholesale lending markets by enabling it to reduce largerindividual credit exposures and thereby to price more flexibly than if all loanswere held as permanent investments. The Corporation also benefits from increasedliquidity. During the first six months of 1995, the Corporation acted as agentor co-agent for approximately $207 billion in syndicated credit facilities,compared with $129 billion in the same period last year.DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATEThe domestic commercial real estate portfolio represents loans secured primarilyby real property, other than loans secured by one-to-four family residentialproperties (which are included in the consumer loan portfolio). The domesticcommercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $5.4 billion at June 30, 1995, adecrease from $5.7 billion at December 31, 1994 and from $6.7 billion at June30, 1994. The decreases are attributable to repayments, the designation ofcertain real estate assets for accelerated disposition in December 1994, a bulkasset sale in October 1994, transfers to real estate owned and charge-offs.The table below sets forth the major components of the domestic commercial realestate loan portfolio at the dates indicated.Commercial mortgages provide financing for the acquisition or refinancing ofcommercial properties, and typically have terms ranging from two-to-five years.Construction loans are generally originated to finance the construction of realestate projects. When the real estate project has cash flows sufficient tosupport a commercial mortgage, the loan is transferred from construction statusto commercial mortgage status.The largest concentration of domestic commercial real estate loans is in the NewYork/New Jersey and Texas markets, representing 43% and 29%, respectively, ofthe domestic commercial real estate portfolio. No other state represented morethan 3% of the domestic commercial real estate loan portfolio. - 40 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate assets were $226 million at June30, 1995, a 9% decrease from December 31, 1994 and a decrease of $1.0 billion,or 82%, from June 30, 1994. The improvement in nonperforming domestic commercialreal estate asset levels since June 30, 1994 is the result of increasedliquidity in the commercial real estate markets coupled with successful workoutactivities, as well as the aforementioned strategic actions taken during 1994.Domestic commercial real estate net charge-offs in the second quarter of 1995totaled $27 million, compared with $49 million in the same period a year ago.For the first six months, such net charge-offs were $28 million in 1995,compared with $123 million in 1994. The lower net charge-offs are due in part tothe decision in December 1994 to designate certain real estate assets foraccelerated disposition. During the first six months of 1995, the Corporationrecorded a $29 million recovery of writedowns as a result of payments receivedon certain foreclosed properties which had been previously written down.Writedowns on commercial real estate owned in the first half of 1994 totaled $43million. Approximately $21 million and $45 million in commercial real estateassets were sold during the first six months of 1995. Generally, these assetswere sold at or above carrying value. The second quarter of 1995 was the tenthconsecutive quarter in which nonperforming domestic commercial real estateassets declined.Domestic commercial real estate net charge-offs and writedowns for the full year1995 are expected to be below the full year 1994 levels.DOMESTIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PORTFOLIOThe domestic financial institutions portfolio includes commercial banks andcompanies whose businesses primarily involve lending, financing, investing,underwriting, or insurance. Loans to domestic financial institutions were $4.0billion at June 30, 1995 or 5% of total loans outstanding. Loans to domesticfinancial institutions are predominantly to broker-dealers, which comprise overhalf the domestic financial institutions total.FOREIGN PORTFOLIOThe foreign portfolio includes foreign commercial and industrial loans, loans toforeign financial institutions, foreign commercial real estate, loans to foreigngovernments and official institutions, and foreign consumer loans. At June 30,1995, the Corporation's total foreign loans were $18.8 billion, compared with$18.3 billion at both December 31, 1994 and June 30, 1994.Included in foreign loans were foreign commercial and industrial loans of $8.6billion at June 30, 1995, an increase of $1.0 billion from the 1994 year-end andan increase of $1.5 billion from June 30, 1994. Total foreign commercial realestate loans at June 30, 1995 were $.5 billion, unchanged from each of December31, 1994 and June 30, 1994. A significant portion of the foreign real estateportfolio is located in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.In the second quarter of 1995, the Corporation incurred a loss of approximately$50 million in noninterest revenue related to the disposition of emerging marketsecurities previously recorded as available-for-sale.MEXICOFor a discussion of significant developments with respect to Mexican debt, seepage B29 of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K.At June 30, 1995, the Corporation's total exposure to Mexico was $1,175 million,which is largely trade and short-term credits. This excludes bonds received aspart of debt renegotiations (i.e., Brady Bonds) with a face value of $2,200million and current carrying value of $1,842 million, which are collateralizedby zero-coupon United States Treasury obligations. - 41 - Part IItem 2 (continued)DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-----------------------------------------------------In the normal course of its business, the Corporation utilizes variousderivative and foreign exchange financial instruments to meet the financingneeds of its customers, to generate revenues through its trading activities, andto manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates.Derivative and foreign exchange instruments represent contracts withcounterparties where payments are made to or from the counterparty based uponspecific interest rates, currency levels, other market rates, or on termspredetermined by the contract. These instruments can provide a cost-effectivealternative to assuming and mitigating risks associated with traditionalon-balance sheet instruments. Derivative and foreign exchange transactionsinvolve, to varying degrees, credit risk (i.e., the possibility that a loss mayoccur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the termsof a contract) and market risk (i.e., the possibility that a change in interestor currency rates will cause the value of a financial instrument to decrease orbecome more costly to settle).The effective management of credit and market risk is vital to the success ofthe Corporation's trading activities and asset/liability management. Because ofthe changing market environment, the monitoring and managing of these risks is acontinual process. For a further discussion, see the Risk Management sectionbelow.The Corporation does not deal, to any material extent, in derivatives whichdealers of derivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions) considerto be "complex" (i.e., exotic and/or leveraged). As a result, the notionalamount of such derivatives were less than 0.5% of the Corporation's totalnotional amount of derivative contracts at June 30, 1995.A discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instrumentsutilized in connection with the Corporation's trading activities andasset/liability management activities is provided on pages B31 and B34 of theCorporation's 1994 Form 10-K, Notes 2, 10 and 12 of this Form 10-Q and the RiskManagement section below.RISK MANAGEMENT---------------The following discussion of risk management focuses primarily on developmentssince December 31, 1994 and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with theRisk Management section on pages B31-B37 of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTCredit risk for both lending-related products and derivative and foreignexchange products represents the possibility that a loss may occur if a borroweror counterparty fails to honor fully the terms of a contract. Under thedirection of the Chief Credit Officer, risk policies are formulated, approvedand communicated throughout the Corporation. The Credit Risk ManagementCommittee, chaired by the Chief Credit Officer, is responsible for maintaining asound credit process, addressing risk issues, and reviewing the portfolio.The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchange producttransactions with regulated financial institutions, which the Corporationbelieves have relatively low credit risk. At June 30, 1995, approximately 94% ofthe mark-to-market exposure of the Corporation's derivative and foreign exchangetransactions were with commercial bank and financial institution counterparties,most of which are dealers in these products. Non-financial institutions onlyaccounted for approximately 6% of the Corporation's derivative and foreignexchange mark-to-market exposure. - 42 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Many of the Corporation's contracts are short-term, which mitigates credit riskas transactions settle quickly. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at June 30,1995 and December 31, 1994. Percentages are based upon remaining contract lifeof mark-to-market exposure amounts. For the notional amounts and credit exposureoutstandings of the Corporation's interest rate contracts and foreign exchangecontracts, see page 16 of this Form 10-Q.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses is available to absorb potential credit lossesfrom the entire loan portfolio, credit-related transactions, as well ason-balance sheet derivative and foreign exchange transactions. The Corporationdeems its allowance for credit losses at June 30, 1995 to be adequate. Althoughthe Corporation considers that it has sufficient reserves to absorb losses thatmay currently exist in the portfolio, but are not yet identifiable, the preciseloss content from the loan portfolio, off-balance sheet credit-relatedinstruments, and on-balance sheet derivative and foreign exchange transactionsis subject to continuing review based on quality indicators, industry andgeographic concentrations, changes in business conditions, and other externalfactors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. TheCorporation will continue to reassess the adequacy of the allowance for creditlosses.The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from derivative and foreignexchange transactions were immaterial during the first half of 1995 and 1994.Additionally, at June 30, 1995 and 1994, nonperforming derivatives contractswere immaterial.The accompanying table reflects the activity in the allowance for credit lossesfor the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 1995 and 1994. - 43 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the Corporation's allowance coverage ratios at June30, 1995, December 31, 1994 and June 30, 1994.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT - TRADING ACTIVITIESFor a discussion of the Corporation's market risk management, see pages B33-B34of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K.The effects of market gains or losses on the Corporation's trading activitieshave been reflected in trading revenue, as the trading instruments aremarked-to-market on a daily basis. For the impact of any unrecognized marketgains or losses on the Corporation's asset/liability management portfolio, seeNote 12 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments of this Form 10-Q.Measuring Market Risk: One of the risk controls the Corporation utilizes in itsoverall risk management process is value-at-risk. The Corporation definesvalue-at-risk as the potential overnight dollar loss from adverse marketmovements that would cover 97.5% of likely market movements, which aredetermined by using two years of historical price and rate data. TheCorporation's value-at-risk calculations employ over 3,100 volatilities and1,240,000 correlations (updated semi-annually) of various market instruments.The Corporation monitors value- at-risk figures for major business units on adaily basis to ensure the potential for market loss is properly reflected. Themethodology generally used to offset positions within a business unit is deemedby the Corporation to be conservative. Only partial credit for correlationbetween instruments within each business unit is incorporated since correlationscan exhibit instability during volatile market environments. Aggregating acrossbusiness units with no correlation offset resulted in an aggregated dailyaverage value-at-risk figure of $29 million for the twelve months ended June 30,1995. Based on actual trading results for the twelve months ended June 30, 1995,which capture the historical correlation among business units, the Corporation'sdaily value-at-risk was reduced to approximately $8 million with 97.5%confidence.For the twelve months ended June 30, 1995, the Corporation posted positive dailymarket risk-related revenue for 199 out of 267 business trading days forinternational and domestic units. For 136 of the 267 days, the Corporation'sdaily market risk-related revenue or losses centered around the $0 million to $5million range, which is representative of the Corporation's emphasis onmarket-making and sales activities. The low number of outlier results (19 dayshaving positive or negative market risk-related revenues exceeding $10 million)exemplifies the Corporation's diversified approach to market risk management asa business strategy.OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENTThe Corporation, like all financial institutions, is subject to the risk offraud and to the risk of unauthorized activities by employees. The Corporationmaintains a comprehensive system of internal controls designed to manage suchrisks. - 44 - Part IItem 2 (continued)ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTThe objective of the asset/liability management process is to manage and controlthe sensitivity of the Corporation's income to changes in market interest rates.The Corporation's net interest income is affected by changes in the level ofmarket interest rates based upon mismatches between the repricing of its assetsand liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity arises in the ordinary course of theCorporation's banking business as the repricing characteristics of its loans donot necessarily match those of its deposits and other borrowings. Thissensitivity can be altered by adjusting the Corporation's investments and thematurities of its wholesale funding activities, and with the use of off-balancesheet derivative instruments. For a further discussion of the Corporation'sasset/liability management process and the variety of techniques used to measureits interest rate sensitivity, see pages B34-B36 of the Corporation's 1994 Form10-K.Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity:Management uses a variety of techniques to measure its interest ratesensitivity. One such tool is aggregate net gap analysis, an example of which ispresented below. Assets and liabilities are placed in maturity ladders based ontheir contractual maturities or repricing dates. Assets and liabilities forwhich no specific contractual maturity or repricing dates exist are placed inladders based on management's judgments concerning their most likely repricingbehaviors.A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilitiesrepricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negative gap - moreliabilities repricing than assets - will benefit net interest income in adeclining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income ina rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positive gap - more assetsrepricing than liabilities - will benefit net interest income if rates arerising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment.At June 30, 1995, the Corporation had $8,955 million more liabilities thanassets repricing within one year, amounting to 5.0% of total assets. Thiscompares with $9,118 million, or 5.3%, of total assets at December 31, 1994. - 45 - Part IItem 2 (continued)At June 30, 1995, based on the Corporation's simulation models, which arecomprehensive simulations of net interest income under a variety of marketinterest rate scenarios, net interest income sensitivity to a gradual 150 basispoint rise in market rates over the next twelve months was estimated at slightlymore than 5% of projected after-tax net income. At December 31, 1994, theCorporation's interest rate sensitivity to a similar increase in market rateswas estimated at 3%.Interest Rate Swaps: Interest rate swaps are one of the various financialinstruments used in the Corporation's asset/liability management activities.Although the Corporation believes the results of its asset/liability managementactivities should be evaluated on an integrated basis, taking into considerationall on- and related off-balance sheet instruments and not a specific financialinstrument, the interest rate swap maturity table, which follows, provides anindication of the Corporation's interest rate swap activity.The table below summarizes maturities and weighted-average interest rates to bereceived and paid on domestic and international interest rate swaps utilized inthe Corporation's asset/liability management at June 30, 1995. The table wasprepared under the assumption that variable interest rates remain constant atJune 30, 1995 levels and, accordingly, the actual interest rates to be receivedor paid will be different to the extent that such variable rates fluctuate fromJune 30, 1995 levels. Variable rates presented are generally based on theshort-term interest rates for relevant currencies (e.g., London InterbankOffered Rate (LIBOR)). Basis swaps are interest rate swaps based on two floatingrate indices (e.g., LIBOR and prime). Forward starting swaps are interest rateswap contracts that become effective at a future time. - 46 - Part IItem 2 (continued)CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY---------------------The following capital and liquidity discussion focuses primarily on developmentssince December 31, 1994. Accordingly, it should be read in conjunction with theCapital and Liquidity section on pages B37-B40 of the Corporation's 1994 Form10-K.The Corporation's capital base at June 30, 1995 remained strong, with capitalratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Corporation's Tier 1 andTotal Capital ratios continued to approximate 8% and 12%, respectively. Totalcapitalization (the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital) increased by $576million during the first six months of 1995.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYTotal stockholders' equity at June 30, 1995 was $11.4 billion, compared with$10.7 billion at December 31, 1994. The $668 million increase from the 1994year-end primarily reflected net income generated during the first six months of1995 of $838 million and a $222 million favorable impact in the fair value ofavailable-for-sale securities accounted for under SFAS 115. These amounts werepartially offset by common and preferred stock dividends totaling $285 millionand the Corporation's common stock buyback program (in an amount, net ofissuance of stock under various employee benefit plans, of approximately $107million). The market valuation of the available-for-sale securities does notinclude the impact of related funding sources. For a further discussion of theCorporation's common stock repurchase programs, see Note 6 - Common Stock onpage 13.During the second quarter of 1995, the Corporation called all of the outstandingshares of its 10% convertible preferred stock for redemption. Substantially allof the 10% convertible preferred stock was converted prior to the redemptiondate, at the option of the holders thereof, into approximately 7.6 millionshares of the Corporation's common stock. The shares of common stock issued uponsuch conversion were issued from treasury.LONG-TERM DEBTThe Corporation's long-term debt at June 30, 1995 was $7,202 million, a decreaseof $789 million from the 1994 year-end. The decrease resulted from maturities of$1,218 million of the Corporation's long-term debt (including $499 million ofsenior medium-term notes and $719 million of other senior notes) and theredemption of $150 million of long-term debt. These decreases were partiallyoffset by additions to the Corporation's long-term debt of $582 million(including $197 million of senior medium-term notes, $185 million ofsubordinated medium-term notes and $200 million of other senior notes). See theLiquidity Management section for further discussion of the Corporation'slong-term debt.COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDSIn the second quarter of 1995, the Board of Directors of the Corporationincreased the quarterly dividend on outstanding shares of its common stock to$.50 per share, an increase of 14% from $.44 per share. On an annual basis, thisrepresents an increase in the dividend rate to $2.00 per common share, from$1.76 per common share. Future dividend policies will be determined by the Boardof Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Corporationand its subsidiaries and other factors, including applicable governmentalregulations and policies.RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOSAt June 30, 1995, the Corporation's ratios of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weightedassets and Total Capital to risk- weighted assets were 8.0% and 11.9%,respectively, well in excess of the minimum ratios specified by the FederalReserve Board. These ratios, as well as the leverage ratio discussed below, donot reflect any adjustment in stockholders' equity due to the adoption of SFASNo. 115. At June 30, 1995, Chemical Bank's ratios of Tier 1 Capital and TotalCapital to risk-weighted assets, were 7.3% and 11.3%, respectively. At suchdate, all of the Corporation's banking institutions were "well capitalized," asdefined by the Federal Reserve Board. To be "well capitalized," a bankingorganization must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, Total Capitalratio of at least 10%, and Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. - 47 - Part IItem 2 (continued)LEVERAGE RATIOSThe Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 Capital (as defined under therisk-based capital guidelines) divided by average total assets (net of allowancefor credit losses, goodwill and certain intangible assets). The minimum leverageratio is 3% for banking organizations that have well-diversified risk (includingno undue interest rate risk); excellent asset quality; high liquidity; goodearnings; and, in general, are considered strong banking organizations. Otherbanking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least 4%-5% dependingupon their particular condition and growth plans. Higher capital ratios could berequired if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a givenbanking organization. The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Corporationof any specific minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to it.The Corporation's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.82% at June 30, 1995, comparedwith 5.95% at December 31, 1994. At June 30, 1995, Chemical Bank's Tier 1leverage ratio was 5.49%, compared with 5.72% at December 31, 1994.The table which follows sets forth the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital, Tier 2Capital and risk-weighted assets, and the Corporation's risk-based Tier 1Capital and Total Capital Ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratios for the datesindicated. - 48 - Part IItem 2 (continued)LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTThe primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the Corporationderives from their ability to generate core deposits (which includes alldeposits except noninterest-bearing time deposits, foreign deposits andcertificates of deposit of $100,000 or more). The Corporation considers fundsfrom such sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit base becauseof the historical stability of such sources of funds. The average core depositsat the Corporation's bank subsidiaries for the 1995 first half were $55 billion,a decrease from $59 billion for the comparable 1994 period. These deposits funda portion of the Corporation's asset base, thereby reducing the Corporation'sreliance on other, more volatile, sources of funds. Average core deposits as apercentage of average loans were 69% for the first half of 1995, compared with79% for the same period a year ago.The Corporation is an active participant in the capital markets. In addition toissuing commercial paper and medium-term notes, the Corporation raises fundsthrough the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and preferred stock. Duringthe first six months of 1995, the Corporation issued $582 million of long-termdebt, including $382 million through its medium-term note program.In June 1995, the international credit rating agency IBCA upgraded its rating ofthe Corporation's long-term unsecured deposits to A-plus from A and its ratingof Chemical Bank's long-term deposits to AA-minus from A- plus. Chemical Bank'sshort-term deposit rating was also increased to A-1-plus from A-1.The following comments apply to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.Cash and due from banks decreased $1.1 billion during the first six months of1995, as net cash used in investing activities exceeded the net cash provided byoperating and financing activities. The $5.6 billion net cash used by investingactivities was primarily impacted by cash outflows from purchases of securities($29.1 billion) and from net loans ($6.1 billion), partially offset by cashinflows from the sales and maturities of securities ($25.3 billion and $3.3billion, respectively). The $2.2 billion net cash provided by operatingactivities was principally due to a reduction in trading-related assets and cashinflows from earnings. The $2.3 billion net cash provided by financingactivities was primarily due to an increase in Federal funds purchased,securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds ($5.1billion) partially offset by decreases in net deposits ($1.6 billion) andlong-term debt ($.8 billion).Cash and due from banks increased $2.6 billion during the first six months of1994, as net cash provided by operating and financing activities exceeded netcash used by investing activities. The $2.7 billion net cash provided byfinancing activities was due to increases in Federal funds purchased, securitiessold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds ($8.5 billion),partially offset by decreases in net deposits ($6.3 billion). The $1.2 billionof net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to earningsadjusted for noncash charges and credits. The $1.3 billion net cash used ininvesting activities was largely the result of cash outflows from purchases ofsecurities ($15.5 billion) and from Federal funds sold and securities purchasedunder resale agreements ($2.2 billion), partially offset by cash inflows fromthe sales and maturities of securities ($11.3 billion and $3.9 billion,respectively), as well as decreases in deposits with banks ($1.6 billion).The Corporation's anticipated cash requirements (on a parent company-only basis)for the remainder of 1995 include approximately $800 million for maturingmedium- and long-term debt, interest payments on its outstanding debt,anticipated dividend payments on the Corporation's common stock and preferredstock, the costs of the initial phase of the aforementioned $1.2 billion stockbuyback program, and other parent company operations. The Corporation considersthe sources of liquidity available to the parent company to be more thansufficient to meet its obligations. The sources of liquidity available to theCorporation (on a parent company-only basis) include its liquid assets(including deposits with its bank subsidiaries and short-term advances to andrepurchase agreements with its securities subsidiaries) as well as dividends orthe repayment of intercompany advances from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries.In addition, as of June 30, 1995, the Corporation had available to it $750million in committed credit facilities from a syndicate of domestic andinternational banks. The facilities included a $450 million 48-month facilityand a $300 million 364-day facility. - 49 - Part IItem 2 (continued)SUPERVISION AND REGULATION--------------------------The following supervision and regulation discussion focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1994. Accordingly, it should be read inconjunction with the Supervision and Regulation section on pages A2-A6 of theCorporation's 1994 Form 10-K.DIVIDENDSAt June 30, 1995, in accordance with the dividend restrictions applicable tothem, the Corporation's bank subsidiaries could, during 1995, without theapproval of their relevant banking regulators, pay dividends of approximately$947 million to their respective bank holding companies, plus an additionalamount equal to their net income from July 1, 1995 through the date in 1995 ofany such dividend payment.In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the Federal ReserveBoard, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have authorityunder the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit thepayment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including theCorporation and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if,in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute anunsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bankingorganization.FDICIAThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")requires the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC depositinsurance. FDICIA also contains provisions limiting certain activities andbusiness methods of depository institutions. Finally, FDICIA provides forexpanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, includingparent holding companies, by such institutions' appropriate Federal bankingregulator. Each of the Corporation's banking institutions were "wellcapitalized" as that term is defined under the various regulations promulgatedunder FDICIA and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect such regulations tohave a material adverse impact on their business operations.OTHER EVENTS------------JOINT VENTURE WITH MELLON BANK CORPORATIONThe Corporation and Mellon Bank Corporation have formed a joint venture thatwill focus on providing stock transfer and related shareholder services topublicly-held companies. The joint venture is called Chemical Mellon ShareholderServices, and is a 50/50 partnership, with Mellon Bank Corporation and theCorporation sharing equally in the joint venture's initial capitalization,including investments in new technology.This joint venture was accounted for as an equity investment effective January1, 1995 with revenues and expenses of the affected business units recordedwithin other revenue.AGREEMENT TO SELL CHEMICAL BANK NEW JERSEY NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONIn March 1995, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell Chemical NewJersey Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Chemical Bank New JerseyNational Association, to PNC for approximately $500 million.
