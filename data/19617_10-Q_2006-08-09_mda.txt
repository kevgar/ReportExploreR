The cashflows from these loans had been classified as investing activities.However, in accordance with Statement of Financial AccountingStandards No.&nbsp;102, &#147;Statement of Cash Flows &#151;Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flowsfrom Certain Securities Acquired for Resale,&#148; cash flows fromthese loans should have been, and in the future will be, classifiedas operating activities, rather than investing activities.Accordingly, the restatements solely affected the classification ofthese activities and the subtotals of cash flows from operating andinvesting activities presented in the affected Consolidatedstatements of cash flows, but they had no impact on the net increase(decrease) in total Cash and due from banks set forth in theConsolidated statements of cash flows for any of the previouslyreported periods.There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the second quarterof 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm'sinternal control over financial reporting.Part II Other InformationItem&nbsp;1 LegalproceedingsThe following information supplements and amends the disclosure set forth under Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3&#147;Legal proceedings&#148; in the Firm's Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the fiscal year endedDecember&nbsp;31, 2005, and Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Legal proceedings&#148; in the Firm's Quarterly Report on Form10&#150;Q for the quarterly period ending March&nbsp;31, 2006 (the &#147;Firm's SEC filings&#148;).Enron litigation.

Additional actions, investigations orproceedings may be brought from time to time in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty ofpredicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large orindeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number ofparties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what theeventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution ofthese matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending mattermay be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counseland after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the outcome of the legalactions, proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a materialadverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Firm. However, in light of theuncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions and investigations, there is no assurance thatthe ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currentlyaccrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase's results for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors, the size of the lossor liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of the risk factors affecting the Firm, see Part&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;1A, Risk Factors, onpages 4&#150;6 and Forward-Looking Statements on page&nbsp;135 of JPMorgan Chase's 2005 Form10&#150;K.Additionally, in connection with the announcement by the Firm on April&nbsp;8, 2006, of its agreement toacquire the consumer, small-business and middle-market banking businesses of The Bank ofNew York, certain additional risks and uncertainties should be considered. These additional risksand uncertainties include: changes in the financial performance of the businesses the Firm ispurchasing or the businesses it is selling; regulatory or legal issues, such as unanticipateddifficulties in securing the regulatory or other approvals or consents required in connection withthe transactions; difficulties or delays in converting the businesses between the parties'information systems, or any inability to integrate the businesses being purchased as fully, or inas timely or cost-efficient a manner, as expected; and costs associated with the transaction,or employee or customer attrition being greater than expected.Item&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the second quarter of 2006, there were no shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant toSection&nbsp;4(2) thereof.On March&nbsp;21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program which authorizes therepurchase of up to $8&nbsp;billion of the Firm's common shares. The new stock repurchase programreplaces the Firm's previous repurchase authorization. The amount authorized includes shares to berepurchased to offset issuances under the Firm's employee stock-based plans. The actual amountof shares repurchased will be subject to various factors, including market conditions; legalconsiderations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position(taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternativepotential investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targetsor time tables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactionsor utilizing Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.For the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2006, under the respective stock repurchase programsthen in effect, the Firm repurchased a total of 17.7&nbsp;million shares and 49.5&nbsp;million shares for$745.5&nbsp;million and $2.0&nbsp;billion at an average price per share of $42.24 and $41.14, respectively.Of the $2.0&nbsp;billion of shares repurchased in the first half of 2006, $1.1&nbsp;billion was repurchasedduring the first quarter under the original $6&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program, and $888&nbsp;millionwas repurchased in the first and second quarters under the new $8&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program.For the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, under the original $6&nbsp;billion stock repurchase programthen in effect, the Firm repurchased 16.8&nbsp;millionshares and 52.8&nbsp;million shares for $593.7&nbsp;million and $1.9&nbsp;billion at an average price per share of$35.32 and $36.17, respectively.
