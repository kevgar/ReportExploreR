The following table presents thecalculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months endedMarch&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006.NOTE 19 &#150; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;includes the after-tax change in unrealized gainsand losses on AFS securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact ofrelated derivatives), cash flow hedging activities and the net actuarial loss and prior servicecost related to the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.99 Table of ContentsNOTE 20 &#150; INCOME TAXESIn July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in incometaxes recognized under SFAS 109. FIN 48 addresses the recognition and measurement of tax positionstaken or expected to be taken, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The Firm adopted andapplied FIN 48 under the transition provisions to all of its income tax positions at the requiredeffective date of January&nbsp;1, 2007, resulting in a $436&nbsp;million cumulative effect increase toRetained earnings, a reduction in Goodwill of $113&nbsp;million and a $549&nbsp;million decrease in theliability for income taxes.At January&nbsp;1, 2007, JPMorgan Chase's liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $4.7&nbsp;billion ofwhich $1.0&nbsp;billion, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. It is difficult to projecthow unrecognized tax benefits will change over the next twelvemonths, but it is reasonably possible that they could change significantly. However, JPMorgan Chase does not expect that anysuch changes in unrecognized tax benefits would have a material impact on its effective tax rateover the next twelve months.The Firm recognizes interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities in Income taxexpense. Included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities at January&nbsp;1, 2007,was $1.3&nbsp;billion for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties, of which thepenalty component was not material.JPMorgan Chase is subject to ongoing tax examinations by the tax authorities of the variousjurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. TheFirm's consolidated federal income tax returns are presently under examination by the InternalRevenue Service (IRS)&nbsp;for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. In addition, the consolidated federalincome tax returns of heritage Bank One Corporation, which merged with and into JPMorgan Chase onJuly&nbsp;1, 2004, are under examination for the years 2000 through 2003, and for the period January&nbsp;1,2004, through July&nbsp;1, 2004. Both examinations are expected to conclude in 2008. Certainadministrative appeals are pending with the IRS relating to prior examination periods, forJPMorgan Chase for the years 2001 and 2002, and for Bank One and itspredecessor entities forvarious periods from 1996 through 1999. For years prior to 2001, refund claims relating to incomeand credit adjustments, and to tax attribute carrybacks, for JPMorgan Chase and its predecessorentities, including Bank One, either have been or will be filed. Also, interest rate swapvaluations by a Bank One predecessor entity for the years 1990 through 1993 are, and have been,the subject of litigation in both the Tax Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals.100 Table of ContentsNOTE 21 &#150; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLitigation reserveThe Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. In accordancewith the provisions of SFAS 5, JPMorgan Chase accrues for a litigation-related liability when it isprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated. While the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in lightof all information known to it at March&nbsp;31, 2007, the Firm's litigation reserves were adequate atsuch date. Management reviews litigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increasedor decreased in the future to reflect further litigation developments. The Firm believes it hasmeritorious defenses to claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and,with respect to such litigation, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating orsettling cases according to management's judgment as to what is in the best interests ofstockholders.NOTE 22 &#150; ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESThe majority of JPMorgan Chase's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes.

The impact of credit card securitization adjustments havebeen included in Reconciling items so that the total Firm results are on a reported basis.

This approach allows management to assess the comparability ofrevenues arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impactrelated to these items is recorded within income tax expense (benefit).

Additionalactions, investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. In view ofthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where theclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legaltheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannotstate with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timingof the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties orimpact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its currentknowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigationreserves, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pendingagainst it should not have a material, adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition ofthe Firm. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions andinvestigations, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will notsignificantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of aparticular matter may be material to JPMorgan113 Table of ContentsChase's operating results for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors, the size ofthe loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm, see Part&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;1A, Risk Factors, on pages4&#150;6 and Forward-Looking Statements on page 147 of JPMorganChase's 2006 Annual Report.Item&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On April&nbsp;17, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0&nbsp;billion of theFirm's common shares.
