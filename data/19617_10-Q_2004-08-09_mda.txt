&nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONJPMorgan Chase & Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;) is a leading globalfinancial services firm with assets of $818&nbsp;billion and operations in more than50 countries. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services forconsumers and businesses, financial transaction processing, investmentmanagement, private banking and private equity. JPMorgan Chase serves more than30&nbsp;million consumers nationwide and many of the world's most prominentcorporate, institutional and government clients. The Firm's wholesalebusinesses are known globally as &#147;JPMorgan,&#148; and its national consumer andmiddle market businesses are known as &#147;Chase.&#148; The wholesale businesses arecomprised of the following four segments: the Investment Bank (&#147;IB&#148;), Treasury& Securities Services (&#147;TSS&#148;), Investment Management & Private Banking (&#147;IMPB&#148;)and JPMorgan Partners (&#147;JPMP&#148;). IB provides a full range of investment bankingand commercial banking products and services, including advising on corporatestrategy and structure, capital raising, risk management and market-making incash securities and derivative instruments in all major capital markets. Thethree businesses within TSS provide debt servicing, securities custody andrelated functions, and treasury and cash management services to corporations,financial institutions and governments. The IMPB business provides investmentmanagement services to institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals andretail customers and also provides personalized advice and solutions to wealthyindividuals and families. JPMP, the Firm's private equity business, providesequity and mezzanine capital financing to private companies. The Firm'snational consumer and middle market businesses, which provide lending andfull-service banking to consumers and small and middle market businesses,comprise Chase Financial Services (&#147;CFS&#148;).The merger of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One Corporation (&#147;Bank One&#148;) occurred onJuly&nbsp;1, 2004; accordingly, the results of operations reported in this Form 10-Qfor the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, reflect only those of JPMorgan Chase.Results reflecting the combined operations of JPMorgan Chase and Bank One willbe reported beginning July&nbsp;1, 2004.On July&nbsp;20, 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. changed its name to JPMorgan Chase &Co. The change eliminated the periods and space in JPMorgan so that the styleof the formal name of the company is now consistent with the style used inreferring to the JPMorgan Chase brand.OVERVIEW&nbsp;&nbsp;Global real GDP grew at a brisk pace over the past year but moderated slightlyin the second quarter. This moderation was the result of slower growthprincipally in the Asia Pacific region, continued solid but slower growth inthe United States, and growth in European economies at a more subdued pace.In the second quarter of 2004, the U.S. economy slowed, restrained by risinginterest rates and higher energy prices. Employment expanded at a solid,above-trend pace, and factory payrolls stabilized. Consumer price measuresregistered outsized gains in the second quarter, reflecting, in part, a sharprise in oil prices early this year. Core inflation picked up as well, in partechoing the indirect impact of higher energy costs. Second quarter economicdevelopments accelerated the timing of expected monetary policy adjustments.The Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates on June&nbsp;30 and hasindicated that it plans to normalize its interest rate policy, most likelyincreasing interest rates at a measured pace, in the coming quarters.In this environment, market conditions became more challenging during thequarter. Bond yields increased early in the quarter in response to strongeconomic news and increased consumer prices. The bond market stabilized, as theeconomy appeared to slow and subsequent inflation reports implied that earlierprice pressures might principally be the result of transitory factors. Inaddition, corporate earnings exceeded expectations by a wide margin, but stockprices were little changed on average, owing to uncertainty about the petroleumoutlook, developments in the Middle East and the U.S. Presidential election.26 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Given the backdrop of improved economic growth compared with a year ago, manyof JPMorgan Chase's wholesale and consumer businesses grew revenues andbenefited from improved credit costs, but the growth was largely offset bydeclines in trading, treasury and mortgage results. This business performancewas more than offset by the litigation reserve charge that was taken during thesecond quarter.JPMorgan Chase reported a net loss of $548&nbsp;million, or $(0.27) per share, inthe second quarter of 2004, compared with net income of $1.8&nbsp;billion, or $0.89per share, in the second quarter of 2003. For the first six months of 2004,reported net income was $1.4&nbsp;billion, or $0.65 per share, compared with $3.2billion, or $1.57 per share, in the same period last year. Second quarterearnings for JPMorgan Chase were reduced by a $2.3&nbsp;billion (after-tax) chargeto increase litigation reserves and $60&nbsp;million (after-tax) of merger costs.Total revenue of $8.6&nbsp;billion declined by 5% from the second quarter of 2003and 4% from the first quarter of 2004. IB trading revenues declined by 38%year-over-year, driven by lower revenue in fixed income and equity markets; andGlobal Treasury revenues declined by 72%, reflecting lower levels of realizedinvestment securities gains and net interest income. Revenue at CHF declined by28% from last year, as expected higher interest rates lowered mortgageoriginations and margins. Total mortgage originations declined by 27% comparedwith the second quarter of 2003. CHF revenue increased by 19% from the firstquarter of 2004 due to higher origination and risk management revenues.Declines in trading, treasury and mortgage revenues were partially offset byhigher investment banking fees, driven by increased advisory and equityunderwriting fees, and private equity gains. For the first half of 2004, totalrevenue of $17.6&nbsp;billion was almost flat compared with 2003.Total expenses in the second quarter of 2004 of $9.5&nbsp;billion increased by 62%year-over-year, and 56% over the first quarter level. Total expenses of $15.5billion in the first half of 2004 increased by 37% over 2003. The increase inboth periods was primarily driven by a $3.7&nbsp;billion addition to the Firm'sLitigation reserve and $90&nbsp;million of Merger costs. Compensation expense in thesecond quarter of 2004 declined by 7% year-over-year and 11% from the firstquarter, driven by lower incentive compensation. For the six months ended June30, 2004, compensation expense of $6.4&nbsp;billion was flat with the same periodlast year.Noncompensation expense, excluding the aforementioned Litigation reserve andMerger costs, was up 3% from the second quarter of 2003 and declined by 1% fromthe first quarter of 2004. The increase from 2003 reflected higher technologycosts and increased marketing costs, offset by lower occupancy costs. For thefirst six months of 2004, Noncompensation expense increased by 8% over 2003.The second quarter of 2004 Provision for credit losses, at $203&nbsp;million,declined by 53% from the second quarter of 2003 but increased from $15&nbsp;millionin the first quarter of 2004. The decline from the 2003 second quarter wasprimarily attributable to lower commercial net charge-offs, as credit qualitycontinued to improve. The increase from the first quarter of 2004 was due to alower reduction in the Allowance for loan losses. The Provision for creditlosses for the first six months of 2004, at $218&nbsp;million, declined by 81% from2003 due to improved credit quality and a smaller commercial loan portfolio.The Firm's commercial nonperforming loans declined by 50% and 18%, andcriticized exposure levels declined by 53% and 19% compared with the secondquarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004, respectively. On the consumer side,the Provision for credit losses, at $323&nbsp;million, was 2% lower than in thesecond quarter of 2003, and the credit card net charge-off ratio declined.Tier 1 capital of $43.5&nbsp;billion increased by 6% year-over-year and decreased by3% from the first quarter of 2004. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.2% at June30, 2004, and 8.4% at June&nbsp;30, 2003.The table below shows JPMorgan Chase's segment results. These results reflectthe manner in which the Firm's financial information was evaluated bymanagement through June&nbsp;30, 2004, and are presented on an operating basis. Fora discussion of the Firm's Segment results, including more information aboutoperating results, see pages 35-53 of this Form 10-Q. Prior-period segmentresults have been adjusted to reflect the alignment of management accountingpolicies or changes in organizational structure among businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;27 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)IB earnings performance was driven by lower trading revenues and theanticipated reduction in Global Treasury revenues, partially offset by higherinvestment banking fees and favorable credit costs.TSS revenue and expense growth rates, when compared with last year, reflect theeffects of acquisitions and write-offs. In addition to acquisitions, TreasuryServices and Institutional Trust Services benefited from higher product revenueand growth in the American Depositary Receipts business, respectively. Higherequity market valuations and a strong seasonal pickup in customer volumesresulted in increased fees and foreign exchange revenue in Investor Services.IMPB operating earnings were up 60% year-over-year and down 20% from the firstquarter of 2004. The increase from last year reflected positive operatingleverage. Assets under supervision (&#147;AUS&#148;) increased by 14% from last year, dueto equity market appreciation and net asset inflows.JPMP had operating earnings of $187&nbsp;million. Net private equity gains were $392million, compared with a net loss of $22&nbsp;million in the second quarter of lastyear. The carrying value of the portfolio was $6.4&nbsp;billion at the end of thequarter, compared with$7.9&nbsp;billion a year ago.CFS had operating earnings of $620&nbsp;million for the quarter, a decrease of 27%from a record quarter in 2003, but an increase of 45% from the prior quarter,both driven primarily by CHF. Total revenue in CHF declined by 28% from lastyear, as higher rates lowered mortgage originations and margins. Riskmanagement of mortgage servicing rights also contributed to the revenuedecline. In other businesses within CFS, Chase Cardmember Services and ChaseAuto Finance operating earnings increased year-over-year, while Chase RegionalBanking and Chase Middle Market earnings decreased.Business outlookBusiness activity is expected to continue to improve over the second half ofthis year, and consumer spending gains should increase moderately as the dragsfrom rising energy costs ease. High corporate profit margins, very strong cashpositions, solid demand, lean inventories and growing business optimism areencouraging businesses to boost spending and cautiously add new employees.Against that backdrop, business loan demand is expected to strengthen. Interestrate markets now anticipate that the Federal Reserve will continue to tightenpolicy in coming quarters. So, barring an unanticipated accelerated pace ofmonetary tightening, bond yields are expected to remain relatively stable.While economic growth is expected to continue to improve over the second halfof the year, there are several potential uncertainties relating to oil, theMiddle East and the U.S. Presidential election.The results for the second half of 2004 will include the results of the newlymerged JPMorgan Chase and Bank One, and the outlook below relates to the newfirm.In the Firm's markets-linked businesses, the IB pipeline is stable, remainingflat to where it was in March. IB is expected to continue to benefit from theimproved economic environment, which should lead to a higher level of clientrevenue. Investment banking fees and client trading activity are largelyindependent of the direction of interest rate moves. However, the tradingenvironment remains challenging and the summer months typically have lowercapital markets activity. The Firm expects gains in JPMP for the second half tobe potentially lower than in the first half, as private equity sales activitiesmay reflect fewer large transactions, and exit opportunities will remaindependent on market conditions.In the Firm's consumer businesses, continued growth is expected in the retailbanking and credit card businesses, with modest growth in receivables andincreasing spending levels. The Firm believes that revenues and operatingearnings in its mortgage business may decline for the remainder of the year, ashigher interest rates are likely to lessen mortgage originations.For the second half of 2004, consumer credit costs should remain relativelystable. In the credit card business, the Firm expects flat to improving creditcost trends. Commercial credit costs may increase from current levels goingforward due to increasing loan demand and a slowdown in recoveries and creditquality improvements in the portfolio.Business eventsMerger with Bank One CorporationEffective July&nbsp;1, 2004, Bank One merged with and into JPMorgan Chase (the&#147;Merger&#148;) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January&nbsp;14, 2004.Bank One's results of operations will be included in the Firm's resultsbeginning July&nbsp;1, 2004.As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Bank Onewas converted in a stock-for-stock exchange into the right to receive 1.32shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase; cash payments for fractional sharesare expected to total approximately $3.1&nbsp;million. JPMorgan Chase stockholderskept their shares, which remained outstanding and unchanged as shares ofJPMorgan Chase following the Merger. The Merger is being accounted for usingthe purchase method of accounting. The purchase price to complete the Mergerwas $58.5&nbsp;billion.The merged company will have its corporate headquarters in New York and itsU.S. retail financial services and commercial banking headquarters in Chicago.The merged company will be known as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and will have 2,300branches in 17 states and top-tier positions in retail banking and lending,credit cards, investment banking, asset management, private banking, treasuryand securities services, middle markets and private equity.28 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)It is expected that cost savings of approximately $3.0&nbsp;billion (pre-tax) willbe achieved by 2007. Merger-related costs to combine the operations of JPMorganChase and Bank One are expected to be approximately $4.0&nbsp;billion (pre-tax). Ofthese costs, approximately $900&nbsp;million, which are specifically related to BankOne, will be accounted for as purchase accounting adjustments and will berecorded as an increase to goodwill. The remaining $3.1&nbsp;billion ofmerger-related costs will be charged against income; a majority of these costsare expected to be incurred in the second half of 2004. The estimatedmerger-related charges will result from actions taken with respect to bothJPMorgan Chase's and Bank One's operations, facilities and employees. Thecharges will be recorded based on the nature and timing of these integrationactions.As part of the merger, certain accounting policies and practices will beconformed, which will result in estimated charges of $1.3&nbsp;billion to $1.5billion (pre-tax) to earnings during the second half of 2004. The largestimpact comes from refining the approach to credit loss reserves, primarilyrelated to the decertification of the seller's retained interest in credit cardsecuritizations. Other policy and business decisions may lead to chargescurrently estimated at $200&nbsp;million to $400&nbsp;million (pre-tax).JPMorgan Chase filed Form 8-K/A on July&nbsp;30, 2004, which contains an unauditedpro forma combined balance sheet at June&nbsp;30, 2004, and unaudited pro formacombined income statements for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, and the yearended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This Form 8-K/A is available through the Firm'swebsite at http://www.jpmorganchase.com and at the Securities and ExchangeCommission's website, at http://www.sec.gov.Litigation reserveAt June&nbsp;30, 2004, JPMorgan Chase recorded a $3.7&nbsp;billion (pre-tax) addition tothe Litigation reserve, which brings the Firm's reserve for all litigation,including Enron and the securities cases covered by previous publicly announcedreserving actions, to approximately $4.7&nbsp;billion. The addition was the resultof a comprehensive and detailed review of the Firm's major litigation exposuresconducted by management after extensive consultation with legal counsel. Whilethe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, the addition reflectsmanagement's assessment of the appropriate reserve level in light of allcurrently known information. Management reviews litigation reservesperiodically, and the reserve may be increased or decreased in the future toreflect further developments. Among the factors weighed by management inadjusting the litigation reserve level were developments in the legal casesthemselves, developments in settlement efforts, recent settlement actions byother parties and a significantly more negative assessment of the litigationenvironment in the United States. The Firm believes it has meritorious defensesto claims asserted against it and intends to continue to defend itselfvigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management's judgment asto what is in the best interest of stockholders.&nbsp;RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&nbsp;The following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations on a reported basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment banking fees and Trading revenueFor a discussion of Investment banking fees and Trading revenue, which areprimarily recorded in IB, see IB segment results on pages 36-39 of this Form10-Q.29 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Fees and commissionsThe table below provides the significant components of Fees and commissions:&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in Investment management and service fees and Custody andinstitutional trust service fees when compared with the second quarter andfirst half of 2003 were primarily due to the following: first, higher equityvaluations of Assets under supervision (which includes assets under custody);second, organic growth in the businesses, including net institutional fund andretail inflows; and third, the acquisitions of the Bank One corporate trustbusiness in November&nbsp;2003 and JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services (&#147;RPS&#148;) in June2003.The increases in Credit card fees from the 2003 second quarter and six monthswere driven by higher servicing fees related to the$1.4&nbsp;billion growth in average securitized credit card receivables, as well ashigher fees earned from the retained credit card portfolio as a result ofgreater customer purchase volume. When compared with the immediately precedingquarter, Credit card fees were up as a result of the traditional growth intransactions going into the summer months.Brokerage commissions increased from the second quarter and first six months oflast year, stemming from higher volumes and improvement in the global equitymarket environment. Brokerage commissions declined from the first quarter dueto reduced equity market volumes.Lending-related service fees were up from the prior-year quarter andyear-to-date as a result of growth in business volume. In particular,automobile loan servicing volume of $6.3&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, was $1.0billion higher than last year's. The declines in Deposit service fees reflectedthe lower fees charged to institutional customers with below-minimum depositaccount balances. Other fees rose from last year, primarily reflecting theacquisition of the Electronic Financial Services (&#147;EFS&#148;) business fromCitigroup in January&nbsp;2004.For additional information on Fees and commissions, see the segment discussionsof IMPB for investment management fees on pages 41-43; TSS for custody and forinstitutional trust and deposit-related fees on pages 39-40; and CFS forconsumer-related fees on pages 45-52 of this Form 10-Q.Private equity gains (losses)For a discussion of the factors that fueled the improvement in the Firm'sprivate equity investment results, which are primarily recorded in JPMP, seethe JPMP segment discussion on pages 43-44 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gainsSecurities gains declined from both periods of 2003 and from the prior quarterof 2004 as a result of the increase in interest rates during the currentquarter. In addition, the second quarter and first half of 2003 includedsubstantial gains, when interest rates were at their lowest in recent years.The gains were primarily recorded in Global Treasury in connection with itsmanagement of the Firm's interest rate risk exposure. CHF also uses AFSsecurities to economically manage the risk related to the value of mortgageservicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;). CHF realized no securities gains or losses relatedto MSR risk management activities in the second quarter, resulting incumulative losses of $4&nbsp;million in the first six months of 2004, in contrastwith gains of $312&nbsp;million and $408&nbsp;million in the respective periods of 2003.Mortgage fees and related incomeFor a discussion of Mortgage fees and related income, which is primarilyrecorded in CHF, see the CHF segment discussion on pages 47-49 of this Form10-Q.Other revenueThe increases in Other revenue from all relevant prior periods reflected highergains on credit card and commercial mortgage loan securitizations and fromsales of securities acquired in loan satisfactions, as well as improvement inthe results of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies. The gains oncredit card and commercial securitizations were $74&nbsp;million in the secondquarter and30 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)$143&nbsp;million in the first six months of 2004, in contrast with $21&nbsp;million and$51&nbsp;million recognized in the equivalent periods of 2003. For sales ofsecurities acquired in loan satisfactions, gains were $54&nbsp;million in the secondquarter and $78&nbsp;million in the first six months of 2004, whereas 2003 sawrealized gains of $19&nbsp;million and $43&nbsp;million for these two respective periods.Net interest incomeNet interest income decreased from all comparable periods in 2003 and 2004. Thedeclines from the 2003 periods reflected lower volumes of commercial loans,driven by softer demand and the Firm's strategic initiative to improve itscredit risk profile. Also contributing was the reduction in volume and spreadson available-for-sale investment securities. Net interest spreads on otherinterest-earning assets, such as trading assets and deposits, whose volumeswere higher than last year's, also narrowed, stemming from the rise in interestrates.On an aggregate basis, the Firm's total average interest-earning assets for thesecond quarter of 2004 were $611&nbsp;billion, up$40&nbsp;billion from the second quarter of last year and $11&nbsp;billion from the firstquarter of this year. The net interest yield on these assets, on a fullytaxable-equivalent basis, was 1.87% in the 2004 second quarter, 29 and 3 basispoints lower than in the second quarter of last year and first quarter of thisyear, respectively.NONINTEREST EXPENSEThe following table presents the components of Noninterest expense:&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation expenseCompensation expense in the second quarter of 2004 was $3.0&nbsp;billion, down 11%from the first quarter of 2004 and 7% from the second quarter of 2003. For thesix months ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, compensation expense of $6.4&nbsp;billion wasslightly lower than in the same period last year. The decrease from theimmediately preceding quarter was due to lower performance-related incentiveaccruals, nonmerger-related severance costs and pension costs. The lowerpension costs were mainly attributable to the increase in the expected returnon plan assets from an additional $1.1&nbsp;billion contribution to the Firm'spension fund in April&nbsp;2004, partially offset by changes in actuarialassumptions for 2004 compared with 2003. The decrease in Compensation expensefrom the second quarter of 2003 was principally attributable to lowerperformance-related incentive accruals, mainly in IB. The slight decrease on ayear-to-date basis primarily reflected lower incentives, as well as therecognition at the beginning of last year of approximately $70&nbsp;million incompensation expense related to the 2,800 employees transferred to IBM inconnection with a technology outsourcing agreement.Occupancy expenseThe declines in Occupancy from the second quarter and first six months of 2003were primarily the result of significant charges taken last year for unoccupiedexcess real estate: $78&nbsp;million and $128&nbsp;million in the first and secondquarters of 2003, respectively; this compares with $26&nbsp;million in the secondquarter of 2004. In view of the merger with Bank One, JPMorgan Chase willcontinue to evaluate its current and projected space requirements. There is noassurance that the Firm will be able to dispose of its excess premises or thatit will not incur additional charges in connection with such dispositions.Technology and communications expenseTechnology and communications expense rose from both periods of last year dueto the Firm-wide growth in business volume, which required upgrades to softwareand greater access to telecommunications facilities. The year-to-date increasefrom last year also reflected the shift to this category of expenses associatedwith the aforementioned IBM outsourcing agreement, which was implemented inApril&nbsp;2003. In the beginning of last year, approximately $70&nbsp;million oftechnology-related costs were recognized in Compensation expense, and $45million in Other expense. In comparison with the first quarter of 2004, thedecline in Technology and communications expense was driven, in part, by slightdecreases in telecommunications and software expenses and lower outsourcedtechnology support costs associated with the IBM agreement.31 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Other expenseThe following table presents the components of Other expense:&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in Other expense from last year's second quarter and first halfwere primarily the result of business acquisitions and the utilization ofthird-party vendors for processing services in TSS and CFS. The increases werealso attributable to higher marketing expenses for the credit card and retailbusinesses; increased travel and entertainment resulting from growth inbusiness volume, primarily in IB; and a $67&nbsp;million write-off of certainsoftware assets at TSS in the second quarter of 2004.Litigation reserveThe second quarter of 2004 included a $3.7&nbsp;billion charge for severalregulatory and legal-related matters. For a further discussion, see Litigationreserve on page 29 and Note 19 of this Form 10-Q. The comparable period in 2003included a charge of$100&nbsp;million for Enron-related litigation.Merger costsDuring the second quarter of 2004, the Firm incurred $90&nbsp;million of Mergercosts, primarily relating to severance programs and integration of facilities.For further details of JPMorgan Chase's Merger costs, refer to Note 7 of thisForm 10-Q.Provision for credit lossesThe Provision for credit losses was $203&nbsp;million for the 2004 second quarter,down $232&nbsp;million from the 2003 second quarter but up $188&nbsp;million from the2004 first quarter, and was $218&nbsp;million for the first six months of 2004, adecline of almost $1.0&nbsp;billion, or 81%, from the comparable period last year.The declines from last year reflected the significant improvement in theoverall credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio. The increase from thepreceding quarter was due to the reduced level of credit cost benefitsresulting from the decrease in the Allowance for loan losses. For furtherinformation on the Provision for credit losses and the Firm's management ofcredit risk, see the discussions of net charge-offs associated with thecommercial and consumer loan portfolios and the Allowance for credit losses, onpages 69-70 of this Form 10-Q.Income tax expenseThe Firm recorded an income tax benefit of $527&nbsp;million in the second quarterof 2004, compared with income tax expense of$940&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003 and $973&nbsp;million in the firstquarter of 2004. The effective tax rates were 49.0% for the second quarter of2004, 34.0% for the second quarter of 2003 and 33.5% for the first quarter of2004. For the first half of 2004, income tax expense was $446&nbsp;million, comparedwith $1.7&nbsp;billion in 2003. The effective tax rates were 24.4% and 34.0% in thefirst six months of 2004 and 2003, respectively. The $3.7&nbsp;billion litigationreserve in the second quarter was treated as a discrete item and wastax-effected at 38%. The effective tax rate on the remaining income was 33.5%.The difference in the tax rates for the second quarter and first half of 2004as compared with prior periods was principally the result of lower reportedpre-tax income, combined with changes in the proportion of income subject tofederal, state and local taxes.&nbsp;EXPLANATION AND RECONCILATION OF THE FIRM'S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES&nbsp;The Firm prepares its Consolidated financial statements using U.S. GAAP; thesefinancial statements appear on pages 3-6 of this Form 10-Q. That presentation,which is referred to as &#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the reader with anunderstanding of the Firm's results that can be consistently tracked from yearto year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with othercompanies' U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementreviews the line-of-business results on an &#147;operating basis,&#148; which is anon-GAAP financial measure. The definition of operating basis starts with thereported U.S. GAAP results. In the case of IB, operating basis includes inTrading revenue the NII related to trading activities. Trading activitiesgenerate revenues which are recorded for U.S. GAAP purposes in two line itemson the income statement: Trading revenue, which includes the mark-to-marketgains or losses on trading positions; and Net interest income, which includesthe interest income or expense related to those positions. Combining both thetrading revenue and related net interest income enables management to evaluateIB's trading activities, by considering all revenue related to theseactivities, and facilitates operating comparisons to other competitors. For a32 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)further discussion ofTrading-related revenue, see IB on pages 36-39 of thisForm 10-Q. In the case of Chase Cardmember Services, operating or managed basisexcludes the impact of credit card securitizations on revenue, the provisionfor credit losses, net charge-offs and receivables. JPMorgan Chase uses theconcept of &#147;managed receivables&#148; to evaluate the credit performance of theunderlying credit card loans, both sold and not sold: as the same borrower iscontinuing to use the credit card for ongoing charges, a borrower's creditperformance will impact both the receivables sold under SFAS 140 and those notsold. Thus, in its disclosures regarding managed receivables, JPMorgan Chasetreats the sold receivables as if they were still on the balance sheet in orderto disclose the credit performance (such as net charge-off rates) of the entiremanaged credit card portfolio. For a further discussion of credit cardsecuritizations, see Chase Cardmember Services on pages 49-50 of this Form10-Q. Operating basis excludes the Litigation reserve and Merger costs, asmanagement believes these items are not part of the Firm's normal dailybusiness operations and, therefore, not indicative of trends, and also do notprovide meaningful comparisons with other periods.The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's reportedto operating results:&nbsp;33 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Management uses the SVA framework, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measureof profitability for the Firm and each of its business segments. To derive SVA,the Firm applies a cost of capital to each business segment. The capitalelements and resultant capital charges provide the businesses and investorswith a financial framework by which to evaluate the trade-off between the useof capital by each business unit versus its return to shareholders. JPMorganChase varies the amount of capital attributed to lines of business based on itsestimate of the economic risk capital required by the line of business as aresult of the credit, market, operational and business risk for each particularline of business and the private equity risk for JPMorgan Partners. JPMorganChase believes this risk-adjusted approach to economic capital compensates fordiffering levels of risk across businesses, and therefore a constant 12% costof capital can be applied across businesses with differing levels of risk. Thecost of capital for JPMP is 15%, because JPMorgan Chase believes that thebusiness risk for JPMP is so sufficiently differentiated that, even after riskadjustment, a higher cost of capital is warranted. Capital charges are anintegral part of the SVA measurement for each business. Under the Firm'scurrent model, average common equity is either underallocated or overallocatedto the business segments, as compared with the Firm's total commonstockholders' equity. The revenue and SVA impact of this over/under allocationis reported under Support Units and Corporate.

The following table sets forth selected IBfinancial data:&nbsp;36 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;IB operating earnings were $703&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2004, comparedwith $1.0&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2003 and $1.1&nbsp;billion in the firstquarter of 2004. The decline in earnings reflected lower trading revenues andthe anticipated reduction in treasury revenues, partially offset by higherinvestment banking fees and favorable credit costs. Return on allocated capitalwas 19% for the second quarter of 2004, compared with 21% for the secondquarter of 2003. For the first six months of 2004, operating earnings of $1.8billion were down 6% from the same period last year. Return on allocatedcapital was 23%, compared with 19% for the first six months of 2003. The higherreturn on allocated capital was driven by a reduction in credit risk capital of$5&nbsp;billion, or 25%, since the second quarter of 2003, reflecting the Firm'slower level of credit risk exposure and improvement in the general creditenvironment.Operating revenue of $3.1&nbsp;billion was 26% lower than in the second quarter of2003 and 22% lower than in the first quarter of 2004. For the first six monthsof 2004, operating revenue of $7.1&nbsp;billion decreased by 14% from the sameperiod last year. Investment banking fees were $883&nbsp;million, up 15% from the2003 second quarter on higher levels of market activity in M&A and equityunderwriting. For the first six months of 2004, Investment banking fees were$1.6&nbsp;billion, up 13% from the first six months of 2003 on higher equityunderwriting and M&A fees, driven by increased market volumes. According toThomson Financial, for the first six months of 2004 compared with full-year2003, the Investment Bank increased its market share in Global Announced M&Afrom 15% to 23%, maintaining its top-five ranking, while its global equity andequity-related ranking declined from No.&nbsp;4 to No.&nbsp;7. The Investment Banksustained last quarter's momentum in U.S. IPOs, increasing its ranking to No.&nbsp;4from No.&nbsp;14 in 2003.Composition of Markets & Lending Revenue and Global Treasury:&nbsp;37 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)IB's markets and lending activities include fixed income and equities revenueand revenue from the Firm's credit portfolio, which includes corporate lendingand credit risk management activities. Markets and lending revenue includesboth client (i.e., market-making) revenue and portfolio management revenue; thelatter reflects net gains or losses, exclusive of client revenue, generatedfrom managing residual risks in the portfolios, as well as gains or lossesrelated to proprietary risk-taking activities to capture market opportunities.IB evaluates its capital markets activities by considering all revenue relatedto these activities, including Trading-related revenue, Fees and commissions,Securities gains, lending-related NII and other revenue.Markets and lending revenue (excluding Global Treasury) for the quarter was$2.1&nbsp;billion, down 27% and 33% from the second quarter of 2003 and firstquarter of 2004, respectively. The decline was driven by lower revenue in fixedincome and equity markets. Fixed income markets revenue was $1.6&nbsp;billion forthe second quarter of 2004, down 28% and 25% from the second quarter of 2003and first quarter of 2004, respectively. Declines in fixed income were a resultof lower portfolio management revenues, as IB was not well positioned tocapture gains from movements in foreign exchange, interest rate and creditmarkets. Equity markets revenue for the second quarter of 2004 was $193million, down 50% and 71% from the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of2004, respectively. The decline in equities reflected reduced portfoliomanagement results as well as lower client activity in equity derivatives, cashinstruments and convertibles. Credit Portfolio revenue of $315&nbsp;million was up15% from the second quarter of 2003 and down 9% from the first quarter of 2004.The increase from the second quarter of 2003 was the result of losses in theprior year on credit derivatives used to manage the loan portfolio, whichresulted from significant spread tightening in 2003; the decrease from thefirst quarter of 2004 was due to a decline in loan volume, which reduced NII.For additional information, see the credit risk management discussion on creditderivatives on pages 64-65 of this Form&nbsp;10Q. For the first six months of 2004,markets and lending revenue (excluding Global Treasury) was $5.1&nbsp;billion, down8% from the first half of 2003. Fixed income results were down 12% due to lowerportfolio management revenue in the second quarter of 2004. Equity marketsrevenue of $866&nbsp;million was up 6% due to increased client activity across allproducts. Credit Portfolio revenue of $660&nbsp;million was flat from the first halfof 2003.Global Treasury's operating revenue was $175&nbsp;million, down 72% and 17% from thesecond quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004, respectively. The decreasereflected lower levels of realized investment securities gains in the AFSinvestment securities portfolio and net interest income. Securities gainsdecreased by 90% and 66% from the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of2004, respectively. Global Treasury is managed on a total-return revenue basis,which includes revenue plus the change in unrealized gains or losses oninvestment securities and risk management activities (included in Othercomprehensive income) and internally transfer-priced assets and liabilities.Global Treasury's total-return revenue was $310&nbsp;million for the second quarterof 2004, down $127&nbsp;million from the second quarter of 2003 and up $327&nbsp;millionfrom the first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004, total-returnrevenue was $293&nbsp;million, down 70% from the first six months of 2003. Positivetotal-return results in the current quarter and for the first six months of2004 were lower than the exceptional gains in the second quarter and first sixmonths of 2003, primarily due to less favorable positioning. Global Treasury'soperating revenue for the first six months was $387&nbsp;million, down 68% from thesame period last year, due to lower levels of realized gains in the AFSinvestment securities portfolio and net interest income. Global Treasury'sactivities complement, and offer a strategic balance and diversificationbenefit to, the Firm's trading and fee-based activities. For a reconciliationof Global Treasury's total revenue to total-return revenue, see page 36 of thisForm 10-Q.38 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense of $2.1&nbsp;billion was down 15% from the second quarter of 2003and 11% from the first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004,operating expense of $4.5&nbsp;billion was down by 6% from last year, due todecreased severance and related costs and lower incentives resulting from lowerfinancial performance. Compensation expense decreased by 16% from the secondquarter of 2003 and 17% from the first quarter of 2004, driven by lowerincentives resulting from lower financial performance. Noncompensation expensedecreased by 2% from the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to a $100million Enron-related litigation reserve in the prior year. Severance andrelated costs decreased by 89% from the second quarter and 86% from the firsthalf of 2003, primarily due to real estate write-offs in 2003.Credit costs were negative $128&nbsp;million for the quarter, compared with negative$5&nbsp;million for the second quarter of 2003 and negative $188&nbsp;million for thefirst quarter of 2004. Credit costs were negative $316&nbsp;million in the firsthalf of 2004, compared with $241&nbsp;million in the first half of 2003. Thereduction in credit costs from the prior-year quarter was primarily due tolower net charge-offs while the reduction from the prior-year first half wasprimarily attributable to a reduction in the allowance for credit losses ascredit quality improved.

The following table sets forth selectedfinancial data of TSS:&nbsp;39 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;TSS reported operating earnings of $121&nbsp;million, a 9% increase from the secondquarter of 2003 and a 2% increase from the first quarter of 2004. For the firstsix months of 2004, operating earnings of $240&nbsp;million were 8% higher comparedwith the first six months of 2003. Return on average allocated capital for thequarter was 15%, compared with 16% for the second quarter of 2003 and 15% forthe first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004 and 2003, return onaverage allocated capital was 15% and 16%, respectively.Operating revenue was $1.2&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2004, an increaseof 21% and 7% from the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004,respectively. On a year-to-date basis, operating revenue was up 20% over lastyear. Fees and commissions were up 25% and 6% from the second quarter of 2003and first quarter of 2004, respectively, primarily driven by the acquisition ofCitigroup's Electronic Financial Services business by Treasury Services, and byInstitutional Trust Services' acquisitions of Bank One's corporate trustbusiness and of Financial Computer Software, L.P. In addition, Fees andcommissions were higher due to increased debt and equity market appreciation,coupled with increased organic growth (i.e., new business and volume growthfrom existing clients) at Investor Services and Institutional Trust Services.Excluding the acquisitions, Fees and commissions would have increased by 11%from the second quarter of 2003. For the first six months of 2004, Fees andcommissions of $1.5&nbsp;billion were 25% higher compared with the first six monthsof 2003 and 11% higher excluding the acquisitions. Net interest incomeincreased by 5% and 3% from the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of2004, respectively, due to higher U.S. and non-U.S. deposits, partially offsetby lower interest rate spreads on deposits, attributable to the low-interestrate environment. For the first six months of 2004, Net interest income of $636million was 7% higher compared with the first six months of 2003. All otherrevenue was up 83% and 52% from the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of2004, respectively, due to a $17&nbsp;million gain on the sale of a nonstrategicbusiness at Investor Services and higher stand-by letter of credit revenue atTreasury Services, partially offset by investment write-offs at InvestorServices and Treasury Services. For the first six months of 2004, Other revenueof $121&nbsp;million was 55% higher compared with the first six months of 2003.Operating expense increased by 23% and 9% from the second quarter of 2003 andfirst quarter of 2004, respectively. For the first six months of 2004,operating expense of $1.9&nbsp;billion was 22% higher compared with the first sixmonths of 2003. Compensation expense was up 13% and 1% from the second quarterof 2003 and first quarter of 2004, respectively, primarily driven by theaforementioned acquisitions, coupled with salary increases, higher benefitexpenses and higher incentives. Noncompensation expense was up 33% and 12% fromthe second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004, reflecting the impact ofthe aforementioned acquisitions, the write-off of impaired software for certaincustody applications at Investor Services, higher operating losses atInstitutional Trust Services and increased costs to support new business andhigher volumes. Severance costs were flat to the second quarter of 2003 and up$3&nbsp;million from the first quarter of 2004. In addition, second quarter 2003severance and related costs included $16&nbsp;million in charges to provide forlosses on subletting unoccupied excess real estate.Assets under custody of $8.0 trillion in the second quarter of 2004 were 18%higher than in the second quarter of 2003, due to increases in the debt andequity markets as well as new business and organic growth. Compared with thefirst quarter of 2004, growth in Assets under custody was flat.40 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile of IMPB, see pages 34-35 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report. The following table reflects selected financialdata of IMPB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPB reported operating earnings of $93&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2004,an increase of 60% from the second quarter of 2003 and a decrease of 20% fromthe first quarter of 2004. The return on average allocated capital for thesecond quarter of 2004 was 7%, compared with 4% in the second quarter of 2003and 8% in the first quarter of 2004. The return on tangible allocated capitalwas 31%, compared with 17% in the second quarter of 2003 and 36% in the firstquarter of 2004. For further information on tangible allocated capital, seefootnote (a)&nbsp;in the table above. IMPB reported year-to-date operating earningsof $209&nbsp;million, an increase of 149% from the prior year. The year-to-datereturn on average allocated capital was 8%, compared with 3% for the prioryear-to-date. The year-to-date return on tangible allocated capital was 34%,compared with 12% for the prior year-to-date.Operating revenue was $805&nbsp;million, 19% higher than in the second quarter of2003 and 2% lower than in the first quarter of 2004. Global equity markets atthe end of the second quarter of 2004 were up significantly from the end of theprior-year quarter (as exemplified by the S&P 500 index, which rose by 17%, andthe MSCI World index, which rose by 22%) and flat compared with the end of theprior quarter. The increase from the prior-year quarter in Fees and commissionsprimarily reflected global equity market appreciation; AUS net inflows; theimpact of the acquisition of JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services (&#147;RPS&#148;), in June2003; and increased brokerage activity. The decrease in Fees and commissionsfrom the prior quarter reflected lower brokerage activity, lower average globalequity market valuations in client portfolios, and net institutional outflows;these were offset by strong retail inflows, as well as nonrecurring items inthe first quarter of 2004. Year-to-date operating revenue was $1.6&nbsp;billion, 24%higher from the first half of the prior year. The year-to-date increase in Feesand commissions primarily reflected global equity market appreciation,41 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)AUS net inflows, increased brokerage activity and the impact of the acquisitionof RPS. The year-to-date increase in all other revenue was driven by increasedbrokerage activity and the impact of accounting for the RPS joint venture priorto the acquisition.Operating expense of $669&nbsp;million was 13% higher compared with the secondquarter of 2003 and 5% higher compared with the first quarter of 2004. Theincrease in compensation expense from the year-ago quarter reflected increasedsalaries and benefits, higher incentives consistent with higher earnings, andthe acquisition of RPS. The increase in noncompensation expense from theyear-ago quarter was affected by increased technology initiatives and theacquisition of RPS. The increase in compensation expense from the prior quarterreflected higher incentives, while the increase in noncompensation expense wasdriven by increased technology and marketing initiatives. Year-to-dateoperating expense of $1.3&nbsp;billion was 11% higher compared with the prioryear-to-date. The year-to-date increase in compensation expense reflectedhigher incentives consistent with higher earnings, increased salaries andbenefits, and the acquisition of RPS. The increase in noncompensation expensereflected the acquisition of RPS and the impact of increased technology andmarketing initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Total Assets under supervision at June&nbsp;30, 2004, of $788&nbsp;billion were 14%higher than at June&nbsp;30, 2003, and 1% lower from March&nbsp;31, 2004. Assets undersupervision increased from the second quarter of 2003, reflecting marketappreciation and AUS net inflows. The decrease from the first quarter of 2004reflected lower global equity market valuations in client portfolios and netinstitutional outflows, partially offset by strong retail inflows. Notreflected in Assets under management is the Firm's 43% equity interest inAmerican Century, whose Assets under management were $91&nbsp;billion atquarter-end, compared with $78&nbsp;billion as of the second quarter of 2003 and $90billion as of the first quarter of 2004.JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMP, see pages 36-37 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report. The following table sets forth selected financialdata of JPMorgan Partners:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMP reported operating earnings of $187&nbsp;million for the 2004 second quarter,compared with an operating loss of $96&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003and operating earnings of $116&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2004. JPMPreported year-to-date operating earnings of $303&nbsp;million, compared with anoperating loss of $318&nbsp;million for the prior year-to-date.Total private equity gains in the second quarter were $392&nbsp;million, comparedwith losses of $22&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003 and gains of $296million in the first quarter of 2004. During the second quarter, JPMP's directprivate equity investments recorded net gains of $374&nbsp;million, compared with anet gain of $123&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003 and a net gain of $304million in the first quarter of 2004. JPMP's direct private equity resultsincluded $402&nbsp;million in realized gains, net mark-to-market losses of $1million on direct public investments, and net write-downs and write-offs of $27million taken on direct private investment positions. Limited partner interestsin third-party funds resulted in net gains of $18&nbsp;million, compared with netlosses of $145&nbsp;million and $8&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003 and firstquarter of 2004, respectively. Total year-to-date private equity gains were$688&nbsp;million, compared with a loss of $252&nbsp;million for the prior-year period.JPMP's year-to-date direct private equity results included $704&nbsp;million inrealized gains, net mark-to-market gains of $24&nbsp;million on direct publicinvestments, and net write-downs and write-offs of $50&nbsp;million taken on directprivate investment positions. Limited partner interests in third-party fundsresulted in net gains for the first half of 2004 of $10&nbsp;million, compared withnet losses of $239&nbsp;million for 2003. Overall, JPMP's performance for bothsecond quarter and year-to-date 2004 benefited from an improving marketenvironment. Capital markets and43 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)M&A volumes rose from prior year levels, providing a better environment forsales and IPO events for JPMP's portfolio. Sales from the JPMP portfolio duringthe first six months of 2004 included two significant investments from theConsumer Retail & Services sector, which generated direct portfolio gains ofmore than $230&nbsp;million. In addition, portfolio valuations stabilized, with netwritedowns $303&nbsp;million lower than year-to-date 2003 levels.JPMP investment portfolioThe carrying value of the JPMP private equity portfolio at June&nbsp;30, 2004, was$6.4&nbsp;billion, a 12% decrease from December&nbsp;31, 2003, and a 19% decrease fromJune&nbsp;30, 2003. The decrease is primarily the result of JPMP exiting selectedinvestments that are not central to its portfolio strategy, such as privatethird-party funds and real estate investments.JPMP invested $213&nbsp;million in direct private equity for the Firm's accountduring the second quarter of 2004 and $375&nbsp;million year-to-date, primarily inbuyouts and growth equity opportunities in the Consumer Retail & Services andIndustrial sectors.The following table presents the carrying value and cost of the JPMP investmentportfolio for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of CFS and a discussion of the profiles for each of itsbusinesses, see pages 38-43 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. Forinformation regarding loans and residual interests sold and securitized, seeNote 12 on pages 13-15 of this Form 10-Q. The following table reflectsselected financial data of CFS:&nbsp;&nbsp;CFS reported second quarter 2004 operating earnings of $620&nbsp;million, a decreaseof 27% from the record second quarter of 2003 and a 45% increase from the firstquarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004, operating earnings of $1.0billion were 30% lower compared with the first six months of 2003. Return onaverage allocated capital for the second quarter was 27%, compared with 39% forthe second quarter of 2003 and 18% for the first quarter of 2004. For the firstsix months of 2004, return on allocated capital was 23%, compared with 35% forthe same period last year. Average allocated capital increased by 5% from thesecond quarter of 2003 and was down 3% from the first quarter of 2004. For thefirst six months of 2004, average allocated capital increased by 8% comparedwith the first six months of last year. The increase from 2003 was primarilydue to an increase in market risk capital associated with the MSR riskmanagement activities of Chase Home Finance.Operating revenue was $3.7&nbsp;billion, a decrease of 7% from the second quarter of2003 and an increase of 8% from the first quarter of 2004. For the six monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2004, operating revenue was $7.1&nbsp;billion, or 7% below the sameperiod last year. The national consumer credit businesses, which include ChaseHome Finance, Chase Cardmember Services and Chase Auto Finance, contributed 75%of second quarter 2004 operating revenue. The declines in revenue from the 2003periods were primarily driven by the anticipated slowdown in the mortgagerefinance business, as well as lower MSR risk management revenue, at Chase HomeFinance. The increase in revenue from the first quarter of 2004 was due tostrong mortgage origination volumes, higher MSR risk management revenue andhigher revenue in Chase Auto Finance due to the first quarter write-off ofprepaid premiums for residual45 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)risk insurance. Net interest income of $2.3&nbsp;billion was down 4% from the secondquarter of 2003 and up 3% from the first quarter of 2004. Net interest incomefor the first six months of 2004 was $4.6&nbsp;billion, a decrease of 3% from thecomparable period in 2003. The decreases from the 2003 periods were primarilydue to lower net interest income on a lower level of AFS securities used tomanage the interest rate risk associated with MSRs, and lower spreads. Theincrease in Net interest income from the first quarter of 2004 reflected highernet interest income in Chase Auto Finance, due to the first quarter write-offof prepaid premiums for residual risk insurance, and higher net interest incomein Chase Home Finance due to higher loan balances. Fees and commissionsincreased by 5% from the second quarter of 2003, 7% from the first quarter of2004 and 6% from the first six months of 2003, primarily driven by highercredit card interchange fees earned on higher consumer purchases. Securitiesgains declined from the second quarter and first six months of 2003, primarilydue to fewer securities sales associated with MSR risk management activities.Mortgage fees and related income of $355&nbsp;million increased from $310&nbsp;million inthe second quarter of 2003 and $241&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2004. Forthe first six months of 2004, Mortgage fees and related income declined by 20%compared with the same period last year. Mortgage originations for the secondquarter and first six months of 2004 were lower compared with the same periodsof 2003, reflecting the smaller mortgage refinance market and pricecompetition, but increased from first quarter 2004 levels, reflecting ashort-term rebound in the mortgage market following the previous quarter'sinterest rate decline.Operating expense of $1.9&nbsp;billion was up 2% compared with the second quarter of2003 and down 7% compared with the first quarter of 2004. For the first sixmonths of 2004, operating expense was up 7% compared with the same period lastyear. Compensation expense decreased by 3% from the second quarter of 2003 dueto lower incentives. The 4% decrease in compensation expense from the firstquarter was primarily due to the contracting mortgage market. Compensationexpense for the first six months of 2004 increased by 2%, primarily due tohigher home equity production, as well as increases in the sales force for homeequity and other high-margin distribution channels in CHF. Noncompensationexpense increased from the prior year's second quarter and first half,primarily due to higher marketing costs and CHF home equity production-relatedexpenses. The decrease from the first quarter of 2004 was due to lowermarketing costs and to the contracting mortgage market. Nonmerger-relatedseverance and related costs increased from the second quarter of 2003,primarily due to costs to move certain business facilities to lower-costlocations. The decrease in nonmerger-related severance and related costs fromthe first quarter of 2004 reflected first quarter restructuring in variouslines of business, particularly in Chase Regional Banking. The increase fromthe first six months of 2003 reflected higher restructuring costs and the coststo move certain facilities to lower-cost locations.Credit costs of $845&nbsp;million were up 3% from the second quarter of 2003 and 13%from the first quarter of 2004. Compared with the second quarter of 2003, netcharge-offs decreased by 1%, as credit quality remained strong. Net charge-offsincreased by 3% from the first quarter of 2004, primarily related to two loansin the Chase Middle Market portfolio. Credit costs in the second quarter of2004 included a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, although thereduction was smaller than that of the second quarter of 2003 and first quarterof 2004. For the first six months of 2004, credit costs of $1.6&nbsp;billion weredown 6% from the same period last year as credit quality remained strong.Delinquency rates in the consumer loan portfolios decreased compared with thesecond quarter of 2003, first quarter of 2004 and first six months of 2003.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within CFS:&nbsp;46 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Chase Home FinanceThe following table sets forth key revenue components of Chase Home Finance'sbusiness:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;) reported operating earnings of $321&nbsp;million, adecline of 43% from record earnings in the second quarter of 2003 and anincrease of 45% from the first quarter of 2004. Operating earnings for thefirst six months of 2004 were $542&nbsp;million, 45% lower than in the same periodlast year. Operating earnings declined from both the second quarter and firstsix months of 2003, as higher interest rates and a smaller refinance marketlowered mortgage originations and margins. MSR risk management revenue was $40million for the second quarter of 2004, a decrease of 83% and 90% from thesecond quarter and first six months of 2003, respectively, but an increase fromthe first quarter's net loss of $7&nbsp;million. The increase in operating earningsfrom the first quarter of 2004 resulted from operating revenue growth, due tohigher mortgage originations and lower overall expenses.During the second quarter of 2004, Chase Home Finance decided to exit theManufactured Housing origination business to focus its resources onstrengthening and accelerating growth in its core home finance businesses. Thedecision to exit the Manufactured Housing origination business will not have amaterial impact on CHF's results.CHF manages and measures its results from two key perspectives: its operatingbusinesses (Production, Servicing and Portfolio Lending) and revenue generatedthrough managing the interest rate risk associated with MSRs. The table belowreconciles management's perspective on CHF's business results to the reportedU.S. GAAP line items shown on the Consolidated statement of income and in therelated Notes to consolidated financial statements:47 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an operating basis, second quarter 2004 Net interest income of $562&nbsp;millionwas up from both the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004 asaverage loan balances increased, primarily as a result of growth in home equityoriginations. Net interest income of $1.1&nbsp;billion for the first six months of2004 increased by 12% from the same period last year due to an increase in homeequity balances, driven by home equity origination growth of 65%. Mortgage feesand related income of $363&nbsp;million and $643&nbsp;million declined relative to thesecond quarter and first six months of 2003, respectively, reflecting thesmaller refinance market and price competition; however, this income increasedcompared with the first quarter of 2004, driven by higher origination volume of$57&nbsp;billion versus $38&nbsp;billion in the prior quarter.In its risk management activities, CHF uses a combination of derivatives,trading securities and AFS securities to manage changes in the market value ofMSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in the market value of MSRs withchanges in the market value of the related risk management instruments. Duringthe second quarter of 2004, positive MSR valuation adjustments of $1.2&nbsp;billionwere partially offset by $1.1&nbsp;billion of aggregate losses on derivatives and securities, net of netinterest earned on securities. For the first six months of 2004, positive MSRvaluation adjustments of $492&nbsp;million were partially offset by $459&nbsp;million ofaggregate losses on derivatives and securities, net of net interest earned on securities. Unrealizedlosses on AFS securities were $221&nbsp;million, $144&nbsp;million and $71&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2004, December&nbsp;31, 2003, and March&nbsp;31, 2004, respectively. The declinein the Net interest income and Securities gains components of MSR riskmanagement revenue from the second quarter and first half of 2003 was primarilydue to a lower level of AFS securities used to manage the interest rate riskassociated with MSRs. Net interest income and the Securities gains componentsof MSR risk management revenue for the second quarter of 2004 were relativelyunchanged from the first quarter. The improvement from the second quarter andfirst half of 2003 in the Mortgage fees and related income component of MSRrisk management revenue reflected the mix of instruments used as hedges at anypoint in time and the impact of market conditions on those hedges, rather thana particular trend. For a further discussion of the most significantassumptions used to value MSRs, please see &#147;MSRs and certain other retainedinterests&#148; in the Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm section and inNotes 13 and 16 on pages 100-103 and 107-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.The following table reconciles the amounts shown as MSR valuation adjustmentsof Chase Home Finance's business:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48 &nbsp;&nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense of $424&nbsp;million increased by 6% from the second quarter of2003 and decreased by 11% from the first quarter of 2004. For the first sixmonths of 2004, operating expense increased by 15% from the same period lastyear. The increase from the second quarter and first six months of 2003 was dueto higher home equity production, as well as increases in the sales forcethrough the latter portion of 2003 for home equity and other higher-margindistribution channels. The decline from the first quarter of 2004 reflected thecontracting mortgage market.Credit costs declined from the second quarter and first six months of 2003, dueto a lower provision for credit losses and lower net charge-offs. Credit costsof $38&nbsp;million increased from negative $9&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2004,due to a reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the first quarter of2004, primarily related to the manufactured housing portfolio. Credit qualitycontinued to be strong, as the net charge-off ratio for the second quarter of2004 was 0.14%, down from 0.18% and 0.16% in the second quarter of 2003 andfirst quarter of 2004, respectively. The net charge-off ratio for the first sixmonths of 2004 was 0.15%, down from 0.19% for the same period last year.Chase Cardmember ServicesOperating earnings at Chase Cardmember Services (&#147;CCS&#148;) of $176&nbsp;millionincreased by 7% from the second quarter of 2003 and 9% from the first quarterof 2004. During the first six months of 2004, operating earnings of $338million increased by 9% compared with the same period last year. The increasefrom the second quarter of 2003 reflected higher revenue, partially offset byan increase in the allowance for loan losses and higher marketing costs. Theincrease from the first six months of 2003 reflected higher revenue partiallyoffset by higher marketing costs and a lower reduction in the allowance forcredit losses. The increase from the first quarter was attributable to higherrevenue reflecting seasonally higher purchase volume, partly offset by anincrease in the allowance for loan losses.CCS's operating results exclude the impact of credit card securitizations onrevenue, the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and receivables.Securitization does not change CCS's reported net income versus operatingearnings; however, it does affect the classification of items on theConsolidated statement of income. The financial information presented belowreconciles the reported basis and managed basis to disclose the effect ofsecuritizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue was $1.6&nbsp;billion, up 5% from the second quarter of 2003 and2% from the first quarter of 2004. The increase in revenue from last yearreflected growth in both Net interest income and Noninterest income. Netinterest income increased by 3%, a result of spread improvement and higherreceivables. Average managed loans increased by only 1% from a year ago, due tohigher consumer purchases, substantially offset by a higher payment rate, whichis partly attributable to consumer liquidity resulting from high levels ofmortgage refinancing activity. Noninterest income increased by 9% due primarilyto higher interchange fees, primarily reflecting a 12% increase in consumerpurchase volume. The increase in purchase volume reflected the ongoingstrategic shift in the portfolio towards higher-volume, rewards-based products,as well as organic growth. CCS added one million new accounts in the secondquarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of account additions at this level,while active accounts remained stable. The increase in revenue from the firstquarter of 2004 primarily reflected seasonally higher purchase volume. For thefirst six months of 2004, operating revenue increased by 6%, reflecting higherinterchange fees, spread improvement and higher loan balances.49 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense of $570&nbsp;million increased by 5% from the second quarter of2003 and decreased by 6% from the first quarter of 2004. For the first sixmonths of 2004, operating expense increased by 9% compared with the first sixmonths of 2003. The increase in expenses from the second quarter and first sixmonths of 2003 primarily reflected higher marketing costs and higher severanceand related costs, to move certain operations to lower-cost locations. Thedecrease in expenses from the first quarter of 2004 was due to lower marketingcosts and lower compensation.Credit costs increased by 5% from the second quarter of 2003 and by 6% from thefirst quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004, credit costsincreased by 3% compared with the same period last year. The higher creditcosts from all periods primarily reflected an increase in the provision forloan losses due to growth in retained balances. Prior quarters reflectedreversals of the allowance for credit losses due to decreasing retained loanbalances as a result of higher levels of new securitizations. Net charge-offsdecreased from the second quarter and first six months of 2003, and they wereessentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2004. Credit quality improved,with the managed net charge-off rate declining to 5.84% in the second quarterof 2004 from 6.02% in the second quarter of 2003. The managed net charge-offrate increased slightly from 5.80% in the first quarter of 2004. The 30&#043; daydelinquency rate improved from the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of2004.Chase Auto FinanceResults at Chase Auto Finance (&#147;CAF&#148;) consist of the Auto Finance and theEducation Finance businesses. CAF's operating earnings of $72&nbsp;million increasedby 7% from the second quarter of 2003 and 140% from the first quarter of 2004.The increase from the prior-year quarter was driven primarily by lower creditcosts, partially offset by lower portfolio spreads and higher expenses. Theincrease in operating earnings from the immediate prior quarter was drivenprimarily by a $40&nbsp;million write-off of prepaid premiums for residual riskinsurance, which resulted in a reduction of leasing revenue recognized duringthe first quarter of 2004, and lower credit costs. For the first six months of2004, operating earnings were 2% lower compared with the same period last year.The decrease reflected lower leasing revenue as mentioned above, lowerportfolio spreads and higher expense, partially offset by lower credit costs.CAF's operating revenue declined by 1% from the second quarter of 2003 andincreased by 31% from the first quarter of 2004. The decrease from theprior-year quarter reflected narrower margins due to a highly competitiveenvironment, which more than offset 9% growth in balances serviced. Theincrease from the first quarter of 2004 was primarily due to the reduction inleasing revenue in the first quarter, as mentioned above. For the first sixmonths of 2004, operating revenue of $384&nbsp;million was down 8% compared with thesame period last year, primarily due to the reduction in leasing revenue andlower portfolio spreads.Operating expense of $80&nbsp;million was up 10% from the second quarter of 2003 andwas flat compared with the first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of2004, operating expense of $160&nbsp;million was 13% higher compared with the sameperiod last year. The increases from the second quarter and first six months of2003 reflected investments in sales and collections and higher staff levels toservice receivable growth.Credit costs of $20&nbsp;million decreased by 43% from the second quarter of 2003and 44% from the first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004,credit costs decreased by 46% compared with the same period last year. Thedecreases were due to lower net charge-offs and a lower provision for loanlosses as a result of improved credit quality. The net charge-off rate was0.28% in the second quarter of 2004, down from 0.37% in the second quarter of2003 and 0.36% in the first quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004,the net charge-off rate was 0.32%, down from 0.42% in the same period lastyear. The 30&#043; day delinquency rate decreased to 1.06% in the second quarter of2004, from 1.14% in the second quarter of 2003 and 1.10% in the first quarterof 2004. The 30&#043; day delinquency rate was the lowest since June&nbsp;30, 2002.Chase Regional BankingChase Regional Banking (&#147;CRB&#148;) reported operating earnings of $10&nbsp;million inthe second quarter of 2004, down 71% from the second quarter of 2003 and upfrom an operating loss of $15&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2004. Thedecrease from the year-ago quarter primarily resulted from lower depositspreads and higher operating expense. The increase from the first quarter of2004 was primarily due to higher revenue, lower credit costs and lowerexpenses. For the first six months of 2004, CRB reported an operating loss of$5&nbsp;million, compared with $61&nbsp;million of operating earnings for the same periodlast year, reflecting higher expenses and higher credit costs.Operating revenue of $654&nbsp;million was essentially flat from the second quarterof 2003 and increased by 3% from the first quarter of 2004. Lower depositspreads, partially offset by 10% growth in average deposits, resulted in Netinterest income decreasing slightly from the second quarter of 2003, whileinvestment product revenue increased. For the first six months of 2004,operating revenue of $1.3&nbsp;billion was flat to the same period last year. CRB'srevenue does not include funding profits earned on its deposit base; theseamounts are included in the results of Global Treasury.50 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense for the second quarter of 2004 of $619&nbsp;million was up 6% fromthe comparable 2003 period and down 3% from the first quarter of 2004. For thefirst six months of 2004, operating expense of $1.3&nbsp;billion was 8% higher thanin the same period last year. The increases from 2003 reflected highercompensation expense and marketing costs, as well as investments in thedistribution network, including upgrading ATMs to eATMs and renovating andopening new branches. The decrease from the first quarter of 2004 was primarilyrelated to lower compensation expense, including lower severance expense.Credit costs of $20&nbsp;million were up from $14&nbsp;million and down from $28&nbsp;million,respectively, in the second quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004. Theincrease from the prior-year quarter was the result of slightly higher netcharge-offs and a slightly lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses.The decrease from the first quarter of 2004 was due to a lower allowance forloan losses, partially offset by slightly higher net charge-offs. For the firstsix months of 2004, credit costs of $48&nbsp;million were higher than last year's,driven by both slightly higher net charge-offs and an addition to the allowancefor loan losses in the first quarter of 2004.As of June&nbsp;30, 2004, CRB's deposit mix was 18% demand, 14% interest checking,47% savings, 12% money market and 9% time (CDs). At June&nbsp;30, 2003, the depositmix was 18% demand, 14% interest checking, 47% savings, 9% money market and 12%time (CDs). As of June&nbsp;30, 2004, core deposits (total deposits less timedeposits) grew by 12% from June&nbsp;30, 2003, and 2% from March&nbsp;31, 2004. For thesecond quarter of 2004, CRB's net new checking accounts were 19,000, up from aloss of 11,000 accounts in the second quarter of 2003 and up from 9,000accounts in the first quarter of 2004.Chase Middle MarketChase Middle Market (&#147;CMM&#148;) operating earnings of $73&nbsp;million were down 6% fromthe second quarter of 2003 and 10% from the first quarter of 2004. The decreasefrom both periods was primarily attributable to higher charge-offs related totwo loans, partly offset by higher revenue and lower expenses. For the firstsix months of 2004, operating earnings of $154&nbsp;million were down 7% from thesame period last year, reflecting lower revenue and higher credit costs,partially offset by lower expenses.Operating revenue of $357&nbsp;million increased by 1% from the second quarter of2003 and 4% from the first quarter of 2004. The increase from the year-agoquarter was primarily due to higher investment banking fees and a gain on thesale of assets. The increase from the first quarter was due to higher Netinterest income and higher investment banking fees. Average deposits for thesecond quarter increased by 21% from the second quarter of 2003 and 4% from thefirst quarter of 2004. For the first six months of 2004, operating revenue of$701&nbsp;million was down 2% from the same period last year, primarily due tonarrower loan and deposit spreads, partially offset by a 16% increase inaverage deposits.Operating expense of $213&nbsp;million in the quarter was down 4% from the secondquarter of 2003 and 2% from the first quarter of 2004. For the first six monthsof 2004, operating expense was $431&nbsp;million, 2% lower than in the same periodin 2003. Lower compensation expense and lower operating losses drove thedecreases from the second quarter and first six months of 2003. Lowercompensation expense drove the decline from the first quarter of 2004.Higher net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2004 related to two loans inthe portfolio, and a lower reduction of the allowance for credit lossescompared with the second quarter of 2003, resulted in credit costs of $19million. For the first six months of 2004, credit costs were $6&nbsp;million,compared with a benefit of $5&nbsp;million for the same period last year. Netcharge-offs for the first six months of 2004 were significantly below the sameperiod last year.51 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICESBUSINESS-RELATED METRICS&nbsp;&nbsp;52 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATE&nbsp;&nbsp;The Support Units and Corporate sector includes technology, legal, audit,finance, human resources, risk management, real estate management, procurement,executive management and marketing groups within Corporate. For a furtherdiscussion of the business profiles of these Support Units as well as adescription of Corporate, see page 44 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Support Units and Corporate reflects the application of the Firm's managementaccounting policies at the corporate level. These policies allocate the costsassociated with technology, operational and staff support services to thebusiness segments, with the intent to recover all expenditures associated withthese services. Other items are retained within Support Units and Corporatebased on policy decisions, such as the over/under allocation of averageallocated capital, the residual component of credit costs and taxes. Businesssegment revenues are reported on a tax-equivalent basis, with the offsetreflected in Support Units and Corporate; see Note 23 on pages 23-25 of thisForm 10-Q.For the second quarter of 2004, Support Units and Corporate reported Operatingearnings of $82&nbsp;million, compared with an Operating loss of $136&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2003 and Operating earnings of $42&nbsp;million in the firstquarter of 2004. Operating earnings were driven primarily by higher capital andlower credit costs compared with the second quarter of 2003, and by highercapital compared with the first quarter of 2004. For the first half of 2004,Support Units and Corporate reported Operating earnings of $124&nbsp;million,compared with an Operating loss of $196&nbsp;million in 2003. The year-to-dateincrease over 2003 was driven primarily by higher capital and lower creditcosts.In allocating the allowance (and provision) for credit losses, each business isresponsible for its credit costs. Although the Support Units and Corporatesector has no traditional credit assets, the residual component of theallowance, which is available for losses in any business segment, is maintainedat the corporate level. For a further discussion of the residual component, seeSummary of changes in the Allowance for credit losses section on pages 69-70 ofthis Form 10-Q.Average allocated capital for the second quarter of 2004 was $9.9&nbsp;billionhigher than in the second quarter of 2003 and $2.7&nbsp;billion higher than in thefirst quarter of 2004. Average allocated capital during the first half of 2004was $9.3&nbsp;billion higher than for the comparable 2003 period. The increases inaverage allocated capital reflected a reduction in credit risk capitalallocated to the business segments and an increase in common stockholders'equity.&nbsp;RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational,business, fiduciary, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion ofthese risks and definitions of terms associated with managing these risks, seepages 45-74 and the Glossary of terms in JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.53 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY&nbsp;CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2003, and should be read inconjunction with pages 46-47 and Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic risk capitalJPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy utilizing internal risk assessmentmethodologies. The Firm assigns economic capital based primarily on five riskfactors: credit risk, market risk, operational risk and business risk for eachbusiness, and private equity risk, principally for JPMP. The methodologiesquantify these risks and assign capital accordingly. These methodologies arediscussed in the risk management sections of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.Capital also is assessed against business units for certain nonrisk factors.Businesses are assessed capital equal to 100% of any goodwill and 50% forcertain other intangibles generated through acquisitions. Additionally, theFirm assesses an &#147;asset capital tax&#148; against managed assets and someoff-balance sheet instruments. These assessments recognize that certain minimumregulatory capital ratios must be maintained by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase alsoestimates the portfolio effect on required economic capital, based oncorrelations of risk across risk categories. This estimated diversificationbenefit leads to a reduction in required economic capital for the Firm.The Firm's quarterly average capital in excess of that which is internallyrequired as of June&nbsp;30, 2004, increased by $9.5&nbsp;billion over June&nbsp;30, 2003. Thechange was primarily due to an increase in average common stockholders' equityof $4.1&nbsp;billion, a $6.2&nbsp;billion reduction in credit risk capital and a $1.2billion reduction in private equity risk capital; these were offset by a $1.5billion increase in market risk capital. The decrease in credit risk capitalfrom the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in commercial exposuresand improvement in the credit quality of the commercial portfolio. Privateequity risk decreased, primarily as a result of the reduction in JPMP's privateequity portfolio. Market risk capital increased, primarily due to growth in theMSR portfolio in CHF as well as higher average trading VAR in IB. The Firm'sexcess capital is the amount of capital retained by JPMorgan Chase inexcess of its required internalcapital to enable the Firm to maintain regulatory capital ratios in line withsimilarly rated bank peers.Regulatory capitalJPMorgan Chase's risk-based capital ratios at June&nbsp;30, 2004, were well inexcess of minimum regulatory guidelines. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, Tier 1 and Totalcapital ratios were 8.2% and 11.2%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 5.5%. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (the sumof Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) was $59.4&nbsp;billion, a decrease of $459&nbsp;millionfrom December&nbsp;31, 2003. This decrease was principally driven by a $582&nbsp;milliondecrease in the allowance for credit losses component of Tier 2 capitalpartially offset by a $370&nbsp;million increase in Tier 1 capital. The increase inTier 1 capital reflected net stock issuance of $752&nbsp;million related to employeebenefit plans, partially offset by a higher deduction for goodwill andnonqualifying intangible assets and an $85&nbsp;million decrease in retainedearnings (net income less common and preferred dividends) during the period.54 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)During 2003, the Firm adopted FIN 46 and, as a result, deconsolidated thetrusts that issue trust preferred securities. If banking regulators were toexclude these securities from Tier 1 capital, it could significantly reduce theTier 1 capital ratio of the Firm. On July&nbsp;2, 2003, the Federal Reserve Boardissued a supervisory letter instructing banks and bank holding companies tocontinue to include trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital. Based on theterms of this letter, and in consultation with the Federal Reserve Board, theFirm continues to include its trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital.Stock repurchaseExcept as disclosed below, the Firm did not repurchase any shares of its commonstock during the first six months of 2004 or all of 2003. On July&nbsp;20, 2004, theBoard of Directors approved an initial stock repurchase program in theaggregate amount of $6.0&nbsp;billion. This amount includes shares to be repurchasedto offset issuances under the Firm's employee equity-based plans. The actualamount of shares repurchased will be subject to various factors, includingmarket conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing ofrepurchase activity; the combined company's capital position (taking intoaccount purchase accounting adjustments); internal capital generation; andalternative potential investment opportunities.The Firm's repurchases of equity securities, other than those pursuant to aformal repurchase program, were as follows:&nbsp;Quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2004&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase grants long-term stock-based incentive awards to certain keyemployees under two plans. The Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved byshareholders in May&nbsp;2000, provides for grants of stock options, stockappreciation rights (&#147;SARs&#148;), restricted stock and restricted stock unitawards. The Stock Option Plan, a nonshareholder-approved plan, provides forgrants of stock options and SARs. At distribution, recipients under both plansare given the option of having shares withheld to cover income taxes. Shares ofrestricted stock withheld under the plans to pay income taxes are treated asshare repurchases. During the second quarter of 2004, 669,247 shares, with anaverage price of $36.23, were withheld to cover income taxes on restrictedstock distributions.DividendsIn the second quarter of 2004, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cashdividend on its common stock of $0.34 per share, payable July&nbsp;31, 2004, tostockholders of record at the close of business on July&nbsp;6, 2004.LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2003, and should be read inconjunction with pages 47-48 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. Inmanaging liquidity, management considers a variety of liquidity risk measuresas well as market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs andthe desired maturity profile of its liabilities.Consistent with its liquidity management policy, the Firm has raised funds atthe holding company sufficient to cover obligations maturing over the next 12months. Long-term funding needs for the parent holding company over the nextseveral quarters are expected to be consistent with prior periods. The Firmmanages its liquidity through a combination of short- and long-term sources offunds to support its balance sheet and its businesses. Under the Firm'sliquidity risk management framework, the Firm maintains sufficient levels oflong-term liquidity through a combination of long-term debt, preferred stock,common equity and core deposits to support the less liquid assets on itsbalance sheet. The Firm's primary source of short-term funds, excludingunsecured borrowings, includes more than $50&nbsp;billion of securities availablefor repurchase agreements and approximately $25&nbsp;billion of credit card,automobile and mortgage loans available for securitization.Credit ratingsThe credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorganChase Bank as of July&nbsp;31, 2004, were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;55 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)At the end of the second quarter of 2004, in anticipation of the July 1 closeof the merger with Bank One, Moody's upgraded the ratings of the Firm by onenotch, moving the parent holding company's senior long-term debt rating to Aa3and JPMorgan Chase Bank's senior long-term debt rating to Aa2. Moody's outlookis stable. Fitch affirmed its ratings and changed its outlook to positive,while S&P affirmed all its ratings and kept its outlook stable.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by creditratings. A reduction in these ratings could adversely impact the Firm's accessto liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateralrequirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing tolend. If the Firm's ratings were downgraded by one notch, the Firm estimatesthat the incremental cost of funds to be in the range of 5 to 15 basis points,reflecting a range of terms from three to five years, and the potential loss offunding to be negligible. Additionally, the Firm estimates the additionalfunding requirements for SPE and other third-party commitments to be relativelymodest. In the current environment, the Firm believes a downgrade is unlikely.For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade onfunding requirements for SPEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements,see Off-balance Sheet Arrangements below and page 63, respectively, of thisForm 10-Q.Balance sheetThe Firm's total assets increased by $46.9&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2003, to$817.8&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, largely due to an increase in deposits placedwith banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. Effective January1, 2004, the Firm elected to net cash paid and received under legallyenforceable master netting agreements, thereby reducing Derivative receivables,a component of trading assets, by $22.5&nbsp;billion and Derivative payables, acomponent of trading liabilities, by $17.7&nbsp;billion. The decrease in derivativereceivables was partially offset by higher debt and equity trading assets dueto growth in IB business activities. Commercial loans declined by $3.9&nbsp;billion,mostly as a result of the deconsolidation of a Firm-sponsored asset-backedcommercial paper conduit which had been previously consolidated on the Firm'sbalance sheet under the guidance of FIN 46. Consumer loans increased by $10.3billion, primarily due to increases in home equity loans. Credit card loansdeclined slightly; loan volumes in the quarter were affected by increasedsecuritization activity, partially offset by strong purchase volumes.Automobile loans increased slightly, helped by origination volumes. The Firm'sliabilities also increased in an amount consistent with the above asset growth,through a combination of continued growth in deposits, which contributed to thegrowth in deposits with banks, and higher securities sold under repurchaseagreements consistent with higher securities purchased under resale agreements.IssuanceDuring the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately$11.4&nbsp;billion of long-term debt; during the same period, $5.6&nbsp;billion oflong-term debt matured or was redeemed. In addition, the Firm securitizedapproximately $4.5&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans, $3.3&nbsp;billion ofcredit card loans and $1.6&nbsp;billion of automobile loans, resulting in pre-taxgains (losses)&nbsp;on securitizations of $60&nbsp;million, $19&nbsp;million and $(3) million,respectively. For a further discussion of loan securitizations, see Note 12 ofthis Form 10-Q and Note 13 on pages 100-103 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 AnnualReport.Off-balance Sheet ArrangementsSpecial-purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;), special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;) orvariable-interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) are an important part of the financialmarkets, providing market liquidity by facilitating investors' access tospecific portfolios of assets and risks. JPMorgan Chase is involved with SPEsin three broad categories of transactions: loan securitizations (through&#147;qualifying&#148; SPEs), multi-seller conduits, and client intermediation. Capitalis held, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and relatedexposures such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments. Fora further discussion of SPEs and the Firm's accounting for SPEs, see Notes 12and 13 of this Form 10-Q and Note 1 on pages 86-87, Note 13 on pages 100-103and Note 14 on pages 103-106 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required toprovide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgradedbelow specific levels, primarily P-1, A-1 and F1 for Moody's, Standard & Poor'sand Fitch, respectively. The amount of these liquidity commitments was $28.8billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004. If JPMorgan Chase Bank were required to providefunding under these commitments, the Firm could be replaced as liquidityprovider. Additionally, with respect to the multi-seller conduits andstructured commercial loan vehicles for which JPMorgan Chase Bank has extendedliquidity commitments, the Bank could facilitate the sale or refinancing of theassets in the SPE in order to provide liquidity.Of its $28.8&nbsp;billion in liquidity commitments to SPEs, $27.8&nbsp;billion isincluded in the Firm's total Other unfunded commitments to extend credit,included in the table below. As a result of the consolidation of multi-sellerconduits in accordance with FIN 46, $1.0&nbsp;billion of these commitments areexcluded from the table, as the underlying assets of the SPE have been includedon the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet.56 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table summarizes certain revenue information related to VIEs withwhich the Firm has significant involvement, and qualifying SPEs:&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue reported in the table above primarily represents servicing andcustodial fee income. The Firm also has exposure to certain VIE vehiclesarising from derivative transactions with VIEs; these transactions are recordedat fair value on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet with changes in fairvalue (i.e., mark-to-market gains and losses) recorded in Trading revenue. SuchMTM gains and losses are not included in the revenue amounts reported in thetable above.The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase's long-term debt and off-balancesheet lending-related financial instruments by remaining maturity at June&nbsp;30,2004:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit portfolio as of June&nbsp;30,2004, focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2003, and should beread in conjunction with pages 51-65, pages 74-77 and Notes 11, 12, 29 and 30of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.The Firm assesses its consumer credit exposure on a managed basis, includingcredit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of credit costs on anoperating, or managed, basis to reported results, see pages 32-35 of this Form10-Q.The Firm allocates credit risk capital to the lines of business based upon itsassessment of &#147;economic credit exposure,&#148; a non-GAAP financial measure that, inthe Firm's view, represents actual future credit exposure. The principaldifference between the Firm's credit exposure on a reported basis and itseconomic view of credit exposure relates to the way the Firm views its creditexposure to derivative receivables and commercial lending-related commitments.For further information, refer to pages 63 and 65 of this Form 10-Q.57 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;The following table presents a summary of the Firm's credit portfolio for the dates indicated:Commercial and consumer credit portfolio&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's total credit exposure (including $34&nbsp;billion of securitizedcredit cards) totaled $720&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, a decline from $731billion at year-end 2003. The decrease reflected a 10% reduction in commercialexposure, offset by an 8% increase in consumer exposure.58 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;Total commercial exposure was $345&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, compared with $383billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The $38&nbsp;billion decline was mainly due to a $34billion decline in derivative receivables, because, effective January&nbsp;1, 2004,the Firm elected to net cash paid and received under legally enforceable masternetting agreements. Loans decreased by $4&nbsp;billion as a result of thedeconsolidation of a Firm-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper conduit whichhad been previously consolidated on the Firm's balance sheet under the guidanceof FIN 46; the conduit was deconsolidated in February&nbsp;2004 due to arestructuring. Lending-related commitments were unchanged; since year-end 2003there was a $4&nbsp;billion increase attributable to the aforementioneddeconsolidation of an asset-backed commercial paper conduit, offset by a $4billion decrease due to deal flow.Below are summaries of the maturity and ratings profiles of the commercialportfolio as of June&nbsp;30, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003. The ratings scale isbased on the Firm's internal risk ratings and is presented on an S&P-equivalentbasis.&nbsp;&nbsp;59 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Exposure Risk Profile($ in billions)During the first half of 2004 the Firm's commercial exposure ratings profileremained relatively stable. The investment-grade component of the derivativeportfolio decreased from 88% to 83% because the Firm elected to net cash paidand received under legally enforceable master netting agreements, whichprimarily affected counterparties considered investment-grade. Based on theeconomic view, which takes into consideration collateral held againstderivative receivables, the portion of the portfolio consideredinvestment-grade decreased only slightly, from 91% as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 to90% as of June&nbsp;30, 2004.Commercial Exposure &#151; selected industry concentrationThe Firm continues to focus on the management and diversification of itsindustry concentrations, with particular attention paid to industries withactual or potential credit concerns. The only significant change in reportedindustry exposure since December&nbsp;31, 2003, relates to the Firm's exposure toCommercial banks, which decreased by $23&nbsp;billion, or 49%, from December&nbsp;31,2003, to $24&nbsp;billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. The decline was primarily the resultof the Firm's election to net cash received under legally enforceable masternetting agreements, which affected derivative receivables. A significantportion of the Firm's derivatives portfolio is transacted with customers in thecommercial banking industry.Commercial Criticized ExposureExposures deemed criticized generally represent a ratings profile similar to arating of CCC&#043;/Caa1 and lower, as defined by Standard & Poors/Moody's. In thefirst half of 2004, the trend experienced in 2003 continued as the criticizedcomponent of the portfolio declined by $2.9&nbsp;billion, or 32%, to $6.0&nbsp;billion atJune&nbsp;30, 2004. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, criticized exposure represented 1.7% of thetotal commercial exposure, compared with 2.3% at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Thedecrease in the first half of 2004 was most significant in the Media andTelecom services industries, with declines of $1.0&nbsp;billion and $324&nbsp;million,respectively. The decrease in Media was largely due to upgrades in the Europeancable sector as a result of improved financial performance and restructurings,while the decrease in Telecom services was due to upgrades based on improvedfinancial condition and loan sales. The remainder of the decline in criticizedexposure was in Other industries due to debt repayments, facility upgrades as aresult of client recapitalizations and additional security and collateral takenin refinancings. A lack of migration of new criticized exposures into theportfolio and gross charge-offs taken during the period also contributed to thedecline.60 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Criticized Exposure Trend($ in billions)(a)&nbsp;Includes all Enron-related credit exposures, inclusive of $108&nbsp;million subject to litigation with a credit-worthy entity.Enron-related exposureThe Firm's exposure to Enron and Enron-related entities was reduced from $609million at December&nbsp;31, 2003, to $293&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004. The $316million decrease was due to the repayment of $200&nbsp;million of secured exposure,a $62&nbsp;million reduction of debtor-in-possession financing, and $54&nbsp;million ofcharge-offs and write-downs taken on unsecured exposure. At June&nbsp;30, 2004,secured exposure of $12&nbsp;million is performing and reported on an amortized costbasis.Country ExposureThe selection of countries discussed below is based on the materiality of theFirm's exposure and its view of actual or potentially adverse creditconditions. Exposure amounts are adjusted for credit enhancements (e.g.,guarantees and letters of credit) provided by third parties located outside thecountry if the enhancements fully cover the country risk, as well as thecommercial risk. In addition, the benefit of collateral, credit derivativesused to manage commercial exposure, and short debt or equity trading positionsare taken into account. Total exposure includes exposure to both government andprivate-sector entities in a country.The exposure to Hong Kong was $1.0&nbsp;billion and $1.7&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004,and December&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively. The exposure to Russia was $294&nbsp;millionand $650&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively. Thedecrease in exposure to Hong Kong over the prior year-end was due to reductionsin cross border lending and trading positions, while the decrease in exposureto Russia was driven entirely by trading positions.Exposures to Brazil and Mexico as of June&nbsp;30, 2004, at $2.0&nbsp;billion and $1.6billion, respectively, were largely unchanged from year-end 2003 levels.Cross-border and local trading positions in both countries increased in thefirst quarter of 2004, raising each country's exposure to $2.4&nbsp;billion.However, exposures to these countries subsequently returned to year-end levelsby June&nbsp;30, 2004.There have been immaterial changes to the Firm's exposures to other countriesdisclosed in JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report since year-end 2003. Duringthe second quarter, the credit conditions in these countries remained stable orimproved.61 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Derivative ContractsFor a further discussion of the derivative contracts utilized by JPMorgan Chasein connection with its trading and end-user activities, see Note 20 of thisForm 10-Q, and pages 58-61 and Note 28 on pages 116-117 of JPMorgan Chase's2003 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and the reportedderivative receivables (i.e., the MTM or fair value of the derivative contractsafter taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the dates indicated:Notional amounts and derivative receivables MTM&nbsp;&nbsp;The $37 trillion of notional principal of the Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at June&nbsp;30, 2004, significantly exceeds, in the Firm's view, thepossible credit losses that could arise from such transactions. For mostderivative transactions, the notional principal amount does not change hands;it is simply used as a reference to calculate payments. In terms of currentcredit risk exposure, the appropriate measure of risk is, in the Firm's view,the MTM value of the contract. The MTM exposure represents the cost to replacethe contracts at current market rates should the counterparty default. WhenJPMorgan Chase has more than one transaction outstanding with a counterparty,and a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists with thecounterparty, the MTM exposure, less collateral held, represents, in the Firm'sview, the appropriate measure of current credit risk with that counterparty asof the reporting date. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, the MTM value of derivativereceivables (after taking into account the effects of legally enforceablemaster netting agreements and the impact of net cash received under suchlegally enforceable master netting agreements) was $50&nbsp;billion. Further, aftertaking into account $7&nbsp;billion of other highly liquid collateral to collaterizeits derivative exposure, the net current MTM credit exposure was $43&nbsp;billion.As of June&nbsp;30, 2004, based on the MTM value of its derivative receivables andafter taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements and collateral held, the Firm did not have a concentration to anysingle derivative receivable counterparty greater than 5%.While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net MTM value ofderivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability ofthat credit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm calculates, on aclient-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related creditloss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent and Average exposure. These measures allincorporate netting and collateral benefits where applicable. The last measure,Average exposure (&#147;AVG&#148;), is used as the basis for the Firm's Economic view ofits credit exposure, upon which it allocates credit capital to the variouslines of business. For more information, see page 53 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003Annual Report. The amounts of these measures have not changed significantlysince December&nbsp;31, 2003.62 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table reconciles Derivative receivables on a MTM basis with theFirm's Economic credit exposure, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the datesindicated:&nbsp;Reconciliation of Derivative Receivables to Economic Credit Exposure&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTM value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates a CreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;) to reflect the credit quality of counterparties.The CVA was $604&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004, a $31&nbsp;million decrease from $635million at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The CVA is based on the Firm's AVG to acounterparty, and on the counterparty's credit spread in the credit derivativesmarket. The primary components of changes in CVA are credit spreads, new dealactivity or unwinds, and changes in the underlying market environment. For adiscussion of the impact of CVA on Trading revenue, see portfolio managementactivity on page 64 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm's Consolidatedbalance sheet derivative receivables MTM, net of cash and other highly liquidcollateral, for the dates indicated:&nbsp;Ratings profile of derivatives receivables MTM&nbsp;&nbsp;The Firm actively pursues the use of collateral agreements to mitigatecounterparty credit risk in derivatives. The percentage of the Firm'sderivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements as of June&nbsp;30, 2004was 78%, unchanged from December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Firm held $30&nbsp;billion ofcollateral as of June&nbsp;30, 2004 (including $23&nbsp;billion of net cash receivedunder legally enforceable master netting agreements), compared with $36&nbsp;billionas of December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Firm posted $24&nbsp;billion of collateral as of June30, 2004, compared with $27&nbsp;billion at the end of 2003.Certain derivative and collateral agreements include provisions that requireboth the Firm and the counterparty, upon specified downgrades in theirrespective credit ratings, to post collateral for the benefit of the otherparty. The impact on required collateral of a single-notch ratings downgrade toJPMorgan Chase Bank, from its current rating of AA- to A&#043;, would have been anadditional $1.0&nbsp;billion of collateral as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. The impact of asix-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- to BBB-) wouldhave been $3.0&nbsp;billion of additional collateral as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. Certainderivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generallyupon JPMorgan Chase Bank being downgraded, at the then-existing MTM value ofthe derivative receivables.63 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the Firm's notional amounts of credit derivativesprotection bought and sold as of June&nbsp;30, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003:&nbsp;Credit derivatives positions&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase has limited counterparty exposure as a result of creditderivatives transactions. Of the $50&nbsp;billion of total derivative receivablesMTM at June&nbsp;30, 2004, approximately $2&nbsp;billion, or 4%, was associated withcredit derivatives, before the benefit of highly liquid collateral. The use ofcredit derivatives to manage exposures does not reduce the reported level ofassets on the balance sheet or the level of reported off-balance sheetcommitments.Portfolio management activityIn managing its commercial credit exposure, the Firm purchases single-name andportfolio credit derivatives. As of June&nbsp;30, 2004, the notional outstandingamount of protection purchased via single-name and portfolio credit derivativeswas $35&nbsp;billion and $2&nbsp;billion, respectively. The Firm also diversifies itsexposures by providing (i.e., selling) small amounts of credit protection,which increases exposure to industries or clients where the Firm has little orno client-related exposure. This activity is not material to the Firm's overallcredit exposure.Use of single-name and portfolio credit derivativesThe credit derivatives used by JPMorgan Chase for its portfolio managementactivities do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, and therefore,effectiveness testing under SFAS 133 is not performed. These derivatives aremarked to market in Trading revenue. The MTM value incorporates both the costof credit derivative premiums and changes in value due to movement in spreadsand credit events, whereas the loans and lending-related commitments being riskmanaged are accounted for on an accrual basis in Net interest income andassessed for impairment in the Provision for credit losses. This asymmetry inaccounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and thecredit derivatives utilized in portfolio management activities, causes earningsvolatility that is not representative of the true changes in value of theFirm's overall credit exposure. The MTM treatment of both the Firm's creditderivatives used for managing credit exposure (&#147;short&#148; credit positions) andthe CVA, which reflects the credit quality of derivatives counterparty exposure(&#147;long&#148; credit positions), provides some natural offset.Additionally, commercial credit exposure is actively managed through secondaryloan and commitment sales that are not associated with loan syndicationactivity or securitization activity as described in Note 12 of this Form 10-Q.During the second quarter of 2004, proceeds from the sale of $610&nbsp;million ofloans and $803&nbsp;million of commitments resulted in a net loss of $3&nbsp;million.During the same period in 2003, the sale of $942&nbsp;million of loans and $526million of commitments resulted in a net loss of $11&nbsp;million. For the firsthalf of 2004, loan and commitment sales were $1.4&nbsp;billion and $1.5&nbsp;billion,respectively, resulting in losses of $11&nbsp;million. Over the same period in 2003, loan and commitment sales of $1.5billion and $1.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, resulted in losses of $23&nbsp;million.Portfolio management activity in the second quarter of 2004 resulted in a lossof $16&nbsp;million in Trading revenue. This activity included $41&nbsp;million of lossesrelated to credit derivatives used to manage the Firm's credit exposure. Ofthis amount, approximately $37&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivativesused to manage the risk of accrual lending activities, and the remaining amountwas associated with credit derivatives used to manage the overall derivativesportfolio. Partially offsetting this loss were gains of $25&nbsp;million related tothe change in the MTM value of the CVA.64 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Trading revenue from portfolio management in the second quarter of 2003resulted in losses of $119&nbsp;million. The losses consisted of $355&nbsp;millionrelated to credit derivatives used to manage the Firm's credit exposure; ofthis amount, $167&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivatives used to managethe risk of accrual lending activities, and $188&nbsp;million was associated withcredit derivatives used to manage the risk of the overall derivativesportfolio. The losses were due to an overall global tightening of creditspreads. These losses were offset by $236&nbsp;million in gains resulting from adecrease in the MTM value of the CVA, also the result of spread tightening.In the first half of 2004, Trading revenue from portfolio management activitiesresulted in $42&nbsp;million of gains. These gains included $57&nbsp;million related tothe change in MTM value of the CVA, partially offset by $15&nbsp;million of netlosses related to credit derivatives used to manage the Firm's credit exposure.The first half of 2003 included $146&nbsp;million of losses in Trading revenue fromportfolio management activities. The losses consisted of $465&nbsp;million relatedto credit derivatives used to manage the Firm's credit exposure; of this amount$238&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivatives used to manage the risk ofaccrual lending activities, and the remaining was associated with creditderivatives used to manage the overall derivatives portfolio. The losses weredue to overall global tightening of credit spreads. These losses were offset by$319&nbsp;million of gains resulting from a decrease in the MTM value of the CVA,also the result of spread tightening.Dealer client activityAs of June&nbsp;30, 2004, the total notional amounts of protection purchased andsold by the dealer business were $345&nbsp;billion and $362&nbsp;billion,respectively. The mismatch between these notional amounts is attributable tothe Firm selling protection on large, diversified, predominantlyinvestment-grade portfolios (including the most senior tranches) and thenhedging these positions by buying protection on the more subordinated tranchesof the same portfolios. In addition, the Firm may use securities to hedgecertain derivative positions. Consequently, while there could be a mismatch innotional amounts of credit derivatives, in the Firm's view, the risk positionsare largely matched.Lending-related commitmentsThe contractual amount of commercial lending-related commitments was $216billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, and December&nbsp;31, 2003. In the Firm's view, the totalcontractual amount of these instruments is not representative of the Firm'sactual credit risk exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amountof credit risk exposure the Firm has to commercial lending-related commitments,which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to theseinstruments, the Firm has established a &#147;loan equivalent&#148; amount for eachcommitment; this represents the portion of the unused commitment or othercontingent exposure that is likely, based on average portfolio historicalexperience, to become outstanding in the event of a default by an obligor.The following table reconciles the reported contractual amounts of the Firm'slending-related commitments on a U.S. GAAP basis with the Firm's Economiccredit exposure, a non-GAAP financial measure, as of the dates indicated:&nbsp;Reconciliation of Commercial Lending-Related Commitments to Economic Credit Exposure&nbsp;&nbsp;65 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio consists primarily of 1&#150;4 familyresidential mortgages, credit cards and automobile loans and leases. Theconsumer portfolio is predominantly U.S.-based. The Firm's managed consumerportfolio totaled $375&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, an increase of 8% fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. Consumer lending-related commitments increased by 10% to$195&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004. The following table presents a summary ofconsumer credit exposure on a managed basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-relatedcommitment categories within the consumer portfolio:Residential Mortgages: Residential mortgage loans are primarily secured byfirst mortgages and were $84.3&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, a $10.6&nbsp;billionincrease from year-end 2003. While lower than their peak levels in 2003, growthremains strong, especially in home equity originations. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, theFirm had $4.8&nbsp;billion of sub-prime residential mortgage loans, of which $2.3billion were held for sale. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, sub-prime residentialmortgage loans outstanding were $1.9&nbsp;billion, of which $1.4&nbsp;billion were heldfor sale. Lending-related commitments on 1&#150;4 family residential mortgagesincreased by $9&nbsp;billion, or 32%, due to new business.Credit Cards: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managedbasis, which includes credit card receivables on the Consolidated balance sheetand those that have been securitized. Managed credit card receivables were$50.6&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, a decrease of 2% compared with year-end 2003.The lower amount of receivables as of June&nbsp;30, 2004 primarily reflects seasonalfactors as well as a higher payment rate. Lending-related commitments on creditcards increased by $8&nbsp;billion, or 6%, due to new business.Automobile: Automobile loans and leases increased by $761&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30,2004, when compared with year-end 2003. This modest increase during the firsthalf of 2004 was driven by a highly competitive environment which resulted inlower originations partially offset by lower securitization activity during thesecond quarter of 2004.Other Consumer: Other consumer loans decreased by 11% compared with year-endlevels primarily as a result of reduced originations in manufactured housing.66 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial and consumer nonperforming exposure and net charge-offsThe following table presents a summary of credit-related nonperforming and pastdue information for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;67 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table presents a summary of credit-related net charge-offinformation for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;Total nonperforming assets (excluding purchased held-for-sale commercial loans)were $2.5&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004, a decline of $679&nbsp;million, or 21%, fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. The commercial portfolio declined by $580&nbsp;million, or 24%,primarily attributed to gross charge-offs of $376&nbsp;million and customerrepayments. Commercial loan net charge-offs for the six months ended June&nbsp;30,2004, were $174&nbsp;million, including $202&nbsp;million of recoveries, compared with$549&nbsp;million of net charge-offs for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003. The netcharge-off rate for commercial loans was 0.35% for the second quarter of 2004,an improvement from 1.20% for the second quarter of 2003 and 0.50% for thefirst quarter of 2004. Commercial net charge-offs are expected to decline inthe second half of 2004, but at a slower pace than the decline experienced inthe first half of 2004.The consumer portfolio also experienced improvement and contributed to thedecrease in nonperforming assets with a decline of $65&nbsp;million, or 12%, to$480&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30, 2004. Across all consumer products, net charge-offrates for the second quarter of 2004 and the first half of 2004 improvedcompared with the same periods in the prior year. The improvement was due to acombination of lower levels of net charge-offs and higher average balances.Management expects consumer net charge-off rates to remain stable for theremainder of the year.68 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall: The allowance for credit losses decreased from December&nbsp;31, 2003, toJune&nbsp;30, 2004, reflecting declines across all components of the allowance.Loans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of June&nbsp;30, 2004, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.The allowance has both specific and expected loss components and a residualcomponent. As of June&nbsp;30, 2004, management deemed the allowance to be adequate(i.e.,69 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable). The allowance for loan losses declined by $556&nbsp;million fromyear-end 2003 and $1.1&nbsp;billion from June&nbsp;30, 2003.The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $549&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2004, a decrease of $368&nbsp;million, or 40%, from year-end 2003. Thedecrease was primarily attributable to overall improvement in the creditquality of the criticized portion of the portfolio, and gross charge-offstaken.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $452&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2004, nearly unchanged from year-end 2003.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.2&nbsp;billion at June30, 2004, a decline of $77&nbsp;million, or 3%, from year-end 2003. The decrease wasprimarily attributable to reduced credit card balances in the first quarter of2004, which had experienced seasonal highs at year-end 2003, as well as lowermanufactured housing net charge-off rates.The residual component of the allowance was $786&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004, adecrease of $109&nbsp;million from year-end 2003. The reduction was a result ofcomplying with the Firm's policy of maintaining the residual component within atarget range of 10% to 20% of the total allowance, including the residualcomponent. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, the residual component represented approximately20% of the total allowance for loan losses. The formula-based commercialspecific and expected components do not consider uncertainties in the economicenvironment or the impact of concentrations in the commercial loan portfolio.These uncertainties are addressed by the residual component of the allowance,which incorporates management's judgment.Lending-related commitments: To provide for the risk of loss inherent in theFirm's process of extending credit, management also computes specific andexpected loss components, as well as a residual component, for commerciallending&#150;related commitments. These are computed using a methodology similar tothat used for the commercial loan portfolio, modified for expected maturitiesand probabilities of drawdown. This allowance, which is reported in Otherliabilities, was $260&nbsp;million, $324&nbsp;million and $384&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004,December&nbsp;31, 2003, and June&nbsp;30, 2003, respectively. The allowance forlending-related commitments decreased by $64&nbsp;million during the six monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2004, due to improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio.Credit costsCredit costs were $689&nbsp;million for the 2004 second quarter, down $226&nbsp;millionfrom the 2003 second quarter but up $201&nbsp;million from the 2004 first quarter,and was $1.2&nbsp;billion for the first six months of 2004, a decline of $938million, or 44%, from the comparable period last year. The declines from lastyear reflected the significant improvement in the overall credit quality of thecommercial loan portfolio. The increase from the preceding quarter was due tothe reduced level of benefits resulting from the decrease in the allowance for loanlosses.&nbsp;MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;Risk management processFor a discussion of the Firm's market risk management organization, see pages66&#150;67 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Value-at-RiskJPMorgan Chase's statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the potential loss fromadverse market moves in an ordinary market environment and provides aconsistent cross-business measure of risk profiles and levels of riskdiversification. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VARcalculation that includes both trading and nontrading activities, including theprivate equity business. The Firm calculates VAR using a one-day time horizonand a 99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to incur lossesgreater than that predicted by VAR estimates only once every 100 trading days,or about 2.5 times a year. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2004, there wereno days on which actual Firmwide market risk&#150;related losses exceeded corporateVAR. For a further discussion of the Firm's VAR methodology, see pages 67&#150;68 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.The table below shows trading VAR by risk type. Details of the VAR exposuresare discussed in the Trading Risk section below.&nbsp;Trading VAR by risk type70 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading riskThe largest contributor to trading VAR in the first half of 2004 was interestrate risk, which includes credit spread risk. Before portfolio diversification,interest rate risk accounted for roughly 58% of the average Trading PortfolioVAR. The diversification effect, which on average reduced the daily averageTrading Portfolio VAR by $45.4&nbsp;million in the first six months of 2004,reflects the fact that the largest losses for different positions and risks donot typically occur at the same time. The risk of a portfolio of positions istherefore usually less than the sum of the risks of the positions themselves.The degree of diversification is determined both by the extent to whichdifferent market variables tend to move together, and by the extent to whichdifferent businesses have similar positions.Average trading VAR rose to $103.3&nbsp;million from $55.9&nbsp;million in the first sixmonths of 2003. First half 2004 period-end VAR also increased over the same2003 period, to $123&nbsp;million from $60&nbsp;million. In both cases, the increase wasdriven by a rise in interest rate and equity VAR, primarily due to a shift inrisk positions, greater interest rate market volatility and higher correlationbetween lines of business.For a complete discussion of the Firm's Trading Risk, see page 70 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report.VAR backtestingTo evaluate the soundness of its VAR model, the Firm conducts daily backtestingof VAR against actual financial results, based on daily market risk&#150;relatedrevenue. Market risk&#150;related revenue is defined as the daily change in value ofthe mark-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interestincome, brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue.The Firm's definition of market risk&#150;related revenue is consistent with theFederal Reserve Board's implementation of the Basel Committee's market riskcapital rules. The histogram below illustrates the Firm's daily marketrisk&#150;related revenue for trading businesses for the first six months of 2004.The chart shows that the Firm posted positive daily market risk&#150;related revenueon 117 out of 129&nbsp;days in the first half of 2004, with eight days exceeding$100&nbsp;million. The inset graph looks at those days on which the Firm experiencedtrading losses and depicts the amount by which the VAR exceeded the actual losson each of those days. Losses were sustained on 12&nbsp;days, with no loss greaterthan $45&nbsp;million; all of the losses were less than the losses predicted by theVAR measure.71 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Economic-value stress testingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. JPMorgan Chase performs a number of different scenario-basedstress tests monthly. Three corporate-wide stress tests are performed on allbusiness lines with trading activity. Scenarios are continually reviewed andupdated to reflect changes in the Firm's risk profile and economic events.The following table represents the worst-case potential economic-valuestress-test loss (pre-tax) in the Firm's trading portfolio as predicted bystress-test scenarios:Trading economic value stress-test loss results &#150; pre-tax&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst-case results of the three corporate-wide stress tests areshown above. These scenarios are based on historical events and incorporateeconomic relationships among market prices. The June&nbsp;10, 2004, and first-half2004 maximum and minimum results are from the &#147;Equity Market Collapse&#148; stressscenario, which is broadly modeled on the events of October&nbsp;1987. Under thisscenario, there is a significant equity sell-off along with a decline in creditprices, and interest rates rally in major currencies. Results from the June&nbsp;10,2004, stress tests reflect equity options and long credit spread positions heldby the Firm on that date, which led to losses under the &#147;Equity MarketCollapse&#148; stress scenario.For a further discussion of the Firm's stress testing methodology, see pages68&#150;69 of the 2003 Annual Report.The Firm conducts simulations of NII for its nontrading activities under avariety of interest rate scenarios, which are consistent with the scenariosused for economic-value stress testing. NII stress tests measure the potentialchange in the Firm's NII over the next 12&nbsp;months. These stress tests highlightexposures to various rate-sensitive factors, such as the rates themselves(e.g., the prime lending rate), pricing strategies on deposits and changes inproduct mix. The stress tests also take into account forecasted balance sheetchanges, such as asset sales and securitizations, as well as prepayment andreinvestment behavior.The following table shows the change in the Firm's NII over the next 12&nbsp;monthsthat would result from uniform increases or decreases of 100 basis points inall interest rates. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NIIstress-test loss was estimated at $(163) million, primarily the result ofincreased funding costs associated with a &#043;100 basis points parallel change.JPMorgan Chase's NII stress-test gain of $148&nbsp;million for a -100 basis-pointsparallel change is primarily the result of decreased funding costs.Nontrading NII stress-test loss results &#150; pre-taxHowever, JPMorgan Chase believes that the standard &#043;100/-100 basis-pointparallel change stress-test scenarios do not adequately reflect the actualcomplexity of markets. To that end, the Firm also applies several additionalscenarios to test how NII would change in response to unlikely but plausibleevents in abnormal markets. The worse-case stress-test loss scenario simulatesthe yield curve and spread changes that occur under the &#147;Credit Crunch&#148;scenario, where yield curves flatten, credit spreads widen sharply and equitiesgenerally decline. This scenario indicates that the Firm's U.S. dollar NIIstress-test loss would be approximately $102&nbsp;million.Other statistical and nonstatistical risk measuresFor a discussion of the Firm's other risk measures, see page 69 of JPMorganChase's 2003 Annual Report.Capital allocation for market riskFor a discussion of the Firm's capital allocation for market risk, see page 71of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Risk monitoring and controlFor a discussion of the Firm's risk monitoring and control process, includinglimits, qualitative risk assessments, model review, and policies andprocedures, see pages 71&#150;72 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.72 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued}&nbsp;OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer topages 72&#150;74 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.&nbsp;PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity risk management, refer topage 74 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report. While JPMorgan Chase computesVAR on its public equity holdings, the potential loss calculated by VAR may notbe indicative of the loss potential for these holdings due to the fact thatmost of the positions are subject to sale restrictions and, often, representsignificant concentration of ownership. Because VAR assumes that positions canbe exited in a normal market, JPMorgan Chase believes that the VAR for publicequity holdings does not necessarily represent the true value-at-risk for theseholdings.&nbsp;SUPERVISION AND REGULATION&nbsp;The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1&#150;5 of JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Form 10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries could pay dividends to their respective bankholding companies, without the approval of their relevant banking regulators,in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $5.1billion at June&nbsp;30, 2004.&nbsp;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM&nbsp;The Firm's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral tounderstanding the reported results. The Firm's most complex accountingestimates require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assetsand liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and controlprocedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgmentsmade as part of such methods, are well controlled, independently reviewed andapplied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies andprocedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologiesoccurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates fordetermining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. For afurther description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involvingsignificant management valuation judgments, see pages 74&#150;77 and the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements in JPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.Allowance for Credit LossesThe Firm's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assignedto a loan. Assuming, for all commercial loans, a one-notch downgrade in theFirm's internal risk ratings, the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans would increase by approximately $380&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004.Furthermore, assuming a 10% increase in the loss severity on all downgradednoncriticized loans, the allowance for commercial loans would increase byapproximately $60&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004. These sensitivity analyses arehypothetical and should be used with caution. The purpose of these analyses isto provide an indication of the impact risk ratings and loss severity have onthe estimate of the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans. It is notintended to imply management's expectation of future deterioration in riskratings or changes in loss severity. Given the process the Firm follows indetermining risk ratings of its loans and assessing loss severity, managementbelieves the risk ratings and loss severity currently assigned to commercialloans are appropriate. Furthermore, the likelihood of a one-notch downgrade forall commercial loans within a short time frame is remote.Trading and Available-for-Sale PortfoliosThe following table summarizes the Firm's trading and available-for-saleportfolios by valuation methodology at June&nbsp;30, 2004:&nbsp;73 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSRs and certain other retained interestsFor a discussion of the most significant assumptions used to value theseretained interests, as well as the applicable stress tests for thoseassumptions, see Notes 13 and 16 on pages 100&#150;103 and 107&#150;109, respectively, ofJPMorgan Chase's 2003 Annual Report.&nbsp;ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS&nbsp;Accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transferIn December&nbsp;2003, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 03-3 (&#147;SOP 03-3&#148;),Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer. SOP03-3 provides guidance on the accounting for differences between contractualand expected cash flows from the purchaser's initial investment in loans ordebt securities acquired in a transfer, if those differences are attributable,at least in part, to credit quality. Among other things, SOP 03-3: (1)prohibits the recognition of the excess of contractual cash flows over expectedcash flows as an adjustment of yield, loss accrual or valuation allowance atthe time of purchase; (2)&nbsp;requires that subsequent increases in expected cashflows be recognized prospectively through an adjustment of yield; and (3)requires that subsequent decreases in expected cash flows be recognized as animpairment. In addition, SOP 03-3 prohibits the creation or carrying over of avaluation allowance in the initial accounting of all loans within its scopethat are acquired in a transfer. SOP 03-3 becomes effective for loans or debtsecurities acquired in fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2004.Accounting for interest rate lock commitments (&#147;IRLCs&#148;)IRLCs associated with mortgages to be held for sale represent commitments toextend credit at specified interest rates. On March&nbsp;9, 2004, the Securities andExchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;105 &#150;Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments (&#147;SAB 105&#148;), whichsummarizes the views of the SEC staff regarding the application of U.S. GAAP toloan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. SAB 105 states thatthe value of the servicing asset should not be included in the estimate of fairvalue of IRLCs. SAB 105 is applicable for all IRLCs accounted for asderivatives and entered into on or after April&nbsp;1, 2004.Prior to April&nbsp;1, 2004, JPMorgan Chase recorded IRLCs at estimated fair value.The fair value of IRLCs included an estimate of the value of the loan servicingright inherent in the underlying loan, net of the estimated costs to close theloan. Effective April&nbsp;1, 2004, and as a result of SAB 105, the Firm no longerassigns fair value to IRLCs on the date they are entered into, with any initialgain only being recognized upon the sale of the resultant loan. Also inconnection with SAB 105, the Firm records any changes in the value of theIRLCs, excluding the servicing asset component, due to changes in interestrates after they are locked. Adopting SAB 105 did not have a material impact onthe Firm's second quarter 2004 Consolidated financial statements.Accounting for Postretirement Health Care Plans which Provide Prescription Drug BenefitsIn May&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued FSP No.&nbsp;FAS106-2, which provides guidance on theaccounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement andModernization Act of 2003 (the &#147;Act&#148;); the Act was signed into law on December8, 2003. Under the Act, a subsidy is available to sponsors of postretirementhealth care plans whose benefits are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part&nbsp;D.The Firm is currently reviewing the Act and the potential impact on its U.S.postretirement medical plan.74 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS(in millions, except per share data, ratios and employees)&nbsp;&nbsp;75 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES(Taxable-Equivalent Interest and Rates; in millions, except rates)&nbsp;&nbsp;76 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES(Taxable-Equivalent Interest and Rates; in millions, except rates)&nbsp;&nbsp;77 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)GLOSSARY OF TERMSAICPA: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.Asset capital tax: Capital allocated to each business segment based on itsaverage asset level and certain off&#150;balance sheet credit-related exposures;reflects the need for the Firm to maintain minimum leverage ratios to meet bankregulatory definitions of &#147;well capitalized.&#148;Assets under management: Represent assets managed by Investment Management &Private Banking on behalf of institutional, retail and private banking clients.Assets under supervision: Represent assets under management as well as custody,brokerage, administration and deposit accounts.Average allocated capital: Represents the portion of average commonstockholders' equity allocated to the business segments, based on theirrespective risks.

JPMorgan Chase is involved in a number of lawsuits andinvestigations arising out of its banking relationships with Enron Corp. andits subsidiaries (&#147;Enron&#148;). Pending in London is a lawsuit by the Firm againstWestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (&#147;WLB&#148;) seeking to compel payment of $165million under an Enron-related letter of credit issued by WLB. The trial ofthat action was conducted in June and July&nbsp;2004, and on August&nbsp;3, 2004, theCourt issued its decision in favor of JPMorgan Chase and ruled that WLB mustpay the letter of credit in full.Actions involving Enron have been initiated by parties against JPMorgan Chase,its directors and certain of its officers. These lawsuits include a series ofpurported class actions brought on behalf of shareholders of Enron, includingthe lead action captioned Newby v. Enron Corp., and a series of purported classactions brought on behalf of Enron employees who participated in variousemployee stock ownership plans, including the lead action captioned Tittle v.Enron Corp. The consolidated complaint filed in Newby names as defendants,among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment banking firms, a numberof law firms, Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities andindividuals, and other individual defendants, including present and formerofficers and directors of Enron; it purports to allege claims against JPMorganChase and the other defendants under federal and state securities laws. TheTittle complaint named as defendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, severalother investment banking firms, a law firm, Enron's former accountants andaffiliated entities and individuals, and other individual defendants, includingpresent and former officers and directors of Enron; it purports to allegeclaims against JPMorgan Chase and certain other defendants under the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (&#147;RICO&#148;) and state common law. OnDecember&nbsp;20, 2002, the Court denied the motion of JPMorgan Chase and otherdefendants to dismiss the Newby action, and the Newby trial is scheduled tocommence in October&nbsp;2006. On September&nbsp;30, 2003, Judge Harmon dismissed allclaims against JPMorgan Chase in Tittle.Additional actions include: a purported, consolidated class action lawsuit byJPMorgan Chase stockholders alleging that the Firm issued false and misleadingpress releases and other public documents relating to Enron in violation ofSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 thereunder;putative class actions on behalf of JPMorgan Chase employees who participatedin the Firm's employee stock ownership plans alleging claims under the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) for alleged breaches of fiduciaryduties and negligence by JPMorgan Chase, its directors and named officers;shareholder derivative actions alleging breaches of fiduciary duties andalleged failures to exercise due care and diligence by the Firm's directors andnamed officers in the management of JPMorgan Chase; individual and putativeclass actions in various courts by Enron investors, creditors and holders ofparticipating interests related to syndicated credit facilities; third-partyactions brought by defendants in Enron-related cases, alleging federal andstate law claims against JPMorgan Chase and many other defendants;investigations by governmental agencies with which the Firm is cooperating; andan adversary proceeding brought by Enron in bankruptcy court seeking damagesfor alleged aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by Enron insiders,return of alleged fraudulent conveyances and preferences, and equitablesubordination of JPMorgan Chase's claims in the Enron bankruptcy.By joint order of the district court handling Newby, Tittle and a number ofother Enron-related cases and the bankruptcy court handling Enron's bankruptcycase, a mediation among various investors and creditor plaintiffs, the Enronbankruptcy estate and a number of financial institution defendants, includingJPMorgan Chase, has been initiated before The Honorable William C. Conner,Senior United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.On July&nbsp;28, 2003, the Firm announced that it had reached agreements with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), the Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork (&#147;FRB&#148;), the New York State Banking Department (&#147;NYSBD&#148;) and the New YorkCounty District Attorney's Office (&#147;NYDA&#148;) resolving matters relating toJPMorgan Chase's involvement with certain transactions involving Enron.

Beginning in May&nbsp;2001, JPMorgan Chase and certain ofits securities subsidiaries were named, along with numerous other firms in thesecurities industry, as defendants in a large number of putative class actionlawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of NewYork. These suits purport to challenge alleged improprieties in the allocationof stock in various public offerings, including some offerings for which aJPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. The suits allege violations ofsecurities and antitrust laws arising from alleged material misstatements andomissions in registration statements and prospectuses for the initial publicofferings (&#147;IPOs&#148;) and alleged market manipulation with respect to aftermarkettransactions in the offered securities. The securities claims allege, amongother things, misrepresentation and market manipulation of the aftermarkettrading for these offerings by tying allocations of shares in IPOs toundisclosed excessive commissions paid to JPMorgan Chase and to requiredaftermarket purchase transactions by customers who received allocations ofshares in the respective IPOs, as well as allegations of misleading analystreports. The antitrust claims allege an illegal conspiracy to requirecustomers, in exchange for IPO allocations, to pay undisclosed and excessivecommissions and to make aftermarket purchases of the IPO securities at a pricehigher than the offering price as a precondition to receiving allocations. OnFebruary&nbsp;13, 2003, the Court denied the motions of JPMorgan Chase and others todismiss the securities complaints. OnNovember&nbsp;3, 2003, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the antitrustclaims relating to the IPO allocation practices, and that decision iscurrently on appeal. A separate antitrust claimalleging that JPMSI and the other underwriters conspired to fix theirunderwriting fees is in discovery.JPMorgan Chase also has received various subpoenas and informal requests fromgovernmental and other agencies seeking information relating to IPO allocationpractices.

In agreeing to the resolution of thecharges, JPMSI neither admitted nor denied the NASD's contentions. In lateSeptember JPMSI and the SEC agreed to resolve matters relating to the SEC'sinvestigation of JPMSI's IPO allocation practices during 1999 and 2000. The SECalleged that JPMSI violated Rule&nbsp;101 of SEC Regulation&nbsp;M in certain &#147;hot&#148; IPOsby attempting to induce certain customers to place aftermarket orders for IPOshares before the IPO was completed. Also, in the case of one IPO, the SECalleged that JPMSI violated &#147;just and equitable principles of trade&#148; under NASDConduct Rule&nbsp;2110 by persuading at least one customer to accept an allocationof shares in a &#147;cold&#148; IPO in exchange for a promise of an allocation of sharesin an upcoming IPO that was expected to be oversubscribed. JPMSI neitheradmitted nor denied the SEC's allegations but consented to a judgment (enteredOctober&nbsp;1, 2003) enjoining JPMSI from future violations of Regulation&nbsp;M andNASD Conduct Rule&nbsp;2110 and requiring JPMSI to pay a civil penalty of $25million.Research analyst conflicts.

Pursuant to the agreement in principle, JPMorganChase, without admitting or denying the allegations concerning allegedconflicts, agreed, among other things: (i)&nbsp;to pay $50&nbsp;million for retrospectiverelief, (ii)&nbsp;to adopt internal structural and operational reforms that willfurther augment the steps it has already taken to ensure the integrity ofJPMorgan Chase analyst research, (iii)&nbsp;to contribute $25&nbsp;million spread overfive years to provide independent third-party research to clients and (iv)&nbsp;tocontribute $5&nbsp;million towards investor education. Mutually satisfactorysettlement documents have been82 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)negotiated and approved by the SEC, the NYSE,the NASD and the regulatory authorities in all states. On October&nbsp;31, 2003, theCourt entered final judgment pursuant to the settlement with the SEC.JPMSI has been named as a co-defendant with nine other broker-dealers in twoactions involving allegations similar to those at issue in the regulatoryinvestigations: a putative class action filed in federal court in Colorado,seeking an unspecified amount of money damages for alleged violations offederal securities laws; and an action filed in West Virginia state court byWest Virginia's Attorney General, seeking recovery from the defendants in theaggregate of $5,000 for each of what are alleged to be hundreds of thousands ofviolations of the state's consumer protection statute. On August&nbsp;8, 2003, theplaintiffs in the Colorado action dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Amotion to dismiss the West Virginia action is pending. A motion to disqualifyprivate counsel retained by the Attorney General to prosecute that action ispending.JPMSI was served by the SEC, NASD and NYSE on or about May&nbsp;30, 2003, withsubpoenas or document requests seeking information regarding certain presentand former officers and employees in connection with a follow-up to theregulatory investigations, this time focusing on whether particular individualsproperly performed supervisory functions regarding domestic equity research.These regulators have also raised issues regarding JPMSI's document retentionprocedures and policies.
