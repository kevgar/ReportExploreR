(continued)NOTE 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATIONEffective December 31, 1998, Chase adopted SFAS 131 which defines the criteriaby which management determines the number and nature of its "operating segments"and sets forth the financial information that is required to be disclosed aboutthese operating segments.Chase's businesses are organized into three major franchises (segments): GlobalBank, National Consumer Services ("NCS") and Chase Technology Solutions ("CTS"),which includes Global Services. These franchises are based on the nature of theproducts and services provided, the type or class of customer, and Chase'smanagement organization.Chase uses SVA, Operating Earnings and Cash Operating Earnings as its measuresof franchise profitability. For a discussion of these measurements, seeManagement Performance Measurements in the Management's Discussion and Analysis("MD&A") on page 19 and Note Twenty-three of the 1998 Annual Report. Thefollowing table provides Chase's segment results.(a) Corporate/Reconciling Items includes the non-global services portion of Chase Technology Solutions, Chase's Global Asset Management and Mutual Funds business, corporate staff areas and the net effect of management accounting policies.(b) Operating Revenue includes Intersegment Revenue, which includes revenue and revenue sharing agreements between segments, net of intersegment expenses. Transactions between business segments are primarily conducted at fair value.(c) Cash Operating Earnings excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs, special items, and amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles.================================================================================The table below presents a reconciliation of the combined segment information toChase's consolidated net income as included in the Consolidated Statement ofIncome. For a further discussion concerning Chase's business franchise(segments) results, see Lines of Business Results in the MD&A on pages 12-16.================================================================================ -10-  11Part IItem 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Operating basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs and special items. For a further discussion, see page 19 of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Operating diluted earnings per share were $1.32 in the first quarter of 1999,compared to $1.17 per share in the first quarter of 1998. Reported dilutedearnings per share were $1.32 in the 1999 first quarter and $.80 in the firstquarter of 1998. Operating earnings and reported net income were each $1.17billion in the first quarter of 1999, compared with $1.05 billion and $725million, respectively, in the first quarter of 1998.Operating highlights for first quarter of 1999 included: - Operating revenue increased 10% to $5.4 billion. - Operating EPS increased by 13% to $1.32. - Shareholder Value Added ("SVA") increased 17% to $501 million. - Return on common equity was 21%. - Chase repurchased approximately $885 million of common stock, on a net basis, in the quarter. Even so, the Tier 1 capital ratio rose to 8.4%.Chase's first quarter results reflected double-digit growth in revenues,earnings per share and shareholder value. Driving these results were thestrength and diversity of Chase's businesses and a disciplined approach to riskand capital management. Chase's management continues to reaffirm its belief inthe strength and sustainability of earnings from Chase's diverse business mix.Each of Chase's major business franchises is at scale, and maintains leadershippositions in its line of business. As a result, Chase's operating revenuesincreased 10% in the 1999 first quarter, despite lower investment banking feesand weaker results in Global Services. Trading-related revenue reached a recordhigh of $837 million. Credit costs remained stable in the first quarter: creditcard net charge-offs improved from the 1998 fourth quarter, and financialconditions in Asia and Latin America have stabilized since the 1998 year-end. AtMarch 31, 1999, total assets on Chase's balance sheet declined by $4.6 billionfrom the 1998 year-end, and Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios increased to8.4% and 12.2%, respectively, reflecting Chase's continued focus on SVA andcapital management.This Management's Discussion and Analysis contains certain forward-lookingstatements, including without limitation, statements related to credit, marketand operating risk. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks anduncertainties and Chase's actual results may differ materially from thoseincluded in these statements. Reference is made to Chase's reports filed withthe Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the 1998 Annual Report,for a discussion of factors that may cause such differences to occur. SeeGlossary of Terms on page 37 for a definition of terms used throughout this Form10-Q. -11-  12- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Management measures Chase's financial performance and that of its business unitsbased on operating earnings, cash operating earnings, and SVA. For a descriptionof these concepts and the basis of presentation that management uses to measureand evaluate business unit profitability, see page 19 of the 1998 Annual ReportPrior periods may be restated to reflect refinements in management reportingpolicies or changes to the management organization.The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basis forChase's three major business franchises. The discussion that follows the tablefocuses on business unit performance within these franchises. See Note Ten ofthis Form 10-Q for a further discussion of Chase's business segments.(a) Cash Operating Earnings represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles.(b) Total column includes Corporate results.

With operations in approximately 50countries, including major operations in all key international financialcenters, Global Bank integrates a broad range of leading product capabilities,industry knowledge and geographic reach to produce superior customer solutions.Global Bank first quarter 1999 operating revenues rose $202 million, an increaseof 8% from first quarter 1998, due to increases in trading-related revenue,securities gains and private equity gains. Cash operating earnings and SVA forthe first quarter 1999 increased $83 million and $75 million, respectively, overthe first quarter 1998.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within Global Bank.(a) All product revenues and expenses for Chase Texas have been allocated to the appropriate business units.NM - Not meaningfulbp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Global MarketsGlobal Markets' activities are diverse, by product and geography, and encompassthe trading and sale of foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income securitiesand commodities. Chase operates 24 hours a day covering the major internationalcross-border financial markets, as well as many local markets. Also includedwithin Global Markets are Chase's domestic and international treasury units,which have the primary responsibility for managing Chase's interest rate riskexposures and investment securities activities. Treasury results are managed ona total return basis with one of the primary objectives being the creation ofeconomic value over time. Total return combines reported revenues (net interestincome and securities gains/losses) and the change in the net unrealizedappreciation/depreciation of all financial instruments and underlying balancesheet items.Trading-related revenue for the first quarter of 1999 was a record $837 million,an increase of 21% from the 1998 first quarter. Results reflect a strongperformance in traditional products, including interest rate derivatives, andnewer products, such as equity derivatives. Securities gains realized during thefirst quarter were $156 million, an 88% increase over first quarter 1998results. The total return (pretax before expenses) from interest rate riskmanagement activities amounted to $251 million for the first quarter of 1999,compared with $86 million in the first quarter of 1998. -13-  14Global Investment BankingGlobal Investment Banking advises corporations, financial institutions,financial sponsors and governments by providing integrated one-stop financialsolutions and industry expertise to clients globally. Chase's corporate financeclient base is extensive and is managed through global client industry groups.Product offerings encompass syndicated finance, high yield securities, mergersand acquisitions advisory, project finance, real estate advisory and placement,restructuring and private placements. Chase is the largest provider of U.S.corporate debt, with a major presence in both the public and private debtmarkets, and has built a strong presence in the advisory area by leveraging itsdebt market leadership.Global Investment Banking operating revenues for the first three months of 1999decreased by $130 million, or 37%, to $220 million when compared with the samequarter in 1998. The revenue decrease reflects lower investment banking fees dueto an overall market decline in leveraged financings and lower trading resultson high yield securities.Corporate LendingCorporate Lending provides credit and lending services to clients globallywithin a strategy that emphasizes origination for distribution. An activeportfolio management effort is an integral part of corporate lending activitiesand is focused on managing concentrations by product, borrower, risk grade,industry and geography. The use of SVA for product and customer decisionsresulted in higher spreads on retained assets and the disposition ofless-SVA-attractive loans. Management expects to continue to manage commercialloans for shareholder value rather than revenue growth. Revenues and cashoperating earnings increased 8% and 24%, respectively, for the 1999 firstquarter when compared with the same 1998 period.Chase Capital PartnersChase Capital Partners ("CCP") is one of the largest global private equityorganizations with approximately $7.1 billion under management, including $4.3billion in direct equity and equity-related investments and $1.4 billion in fundinvestments.

Earnings reflected continued strength in the equity markets, a favorableenvironment for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) and the positiveimpact of maturing investments within the portfolio, partially offset by highercosts to support a higher level of investments.Global Private BankThe Global Private Bank serves a global client base of high net worthindividuals and families, offering a full range of private banking services aswell as access to the broad product capabilities of the Global Bank. Servicesinclude investment management, global capital market products and services, riskmanagement, alternative investments such as private equity funds, trust andestate planning, global custody, mutual funds, credit and banking, andphilanthropic advisory services. Revenues increased 4% from the 1998 firstquarter reflecting double digit growth in the U.S., particularly in investmentmanagement and trust fees, offset by lower revenues in selected internationalmarkets.Middle MarketsChase is the premier provider of financial services to middle-market companies(companies with sales ranging from $10 million to $500 million) regionally, witha national focus in selected industries. It is the market leader in the New Yorkmetropolitan tri-state area. Cash operating earnings decreased slightly in the1999 first quarter, reflecting lower spreads and an increase in expenses. -14-  15NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICESNational Consumer Services ("NCS") serves more than 30 million customersnationwide offering a wide variety of financial products and services through adiverse array of channels. Characterized by significant scale, and operatingunder the strong Chase brand, NCS combines nationwide presence with a leadingconsumer and small business banking franchise in the New York metropolitantri-state region and key Texas markets. NCS's strategy is driven by informationtechnology, which provides insights into customer behavior, requirements andpreferences, and enables the franchise to develop financial solutions that bestmeet customer needs.Cash operating earnings for the first quarter of 1999 increased $63 million, or22%, over the same period in 1998. Revenue growth of 12% contributed to theincrease in cash operating earnings and reflects higher revenues and volumesacross all of NCS's businesses. SVA increased $62 million, or 86%, in the firstthree months of 1999 from the same period in 1998.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within NCS.(a) All product revenues and expenses for Chase Texas have been allocated to the appropriate business units.NM - Not meaningfulbp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Chase Cardmember ServicesChase Cardmember Services ("CCS") ranks as the fourth-largest bank card issuerin the United States. CCS also reflects the results of Chase's internationalconsumer business, which includes Chase Manhattan Card Company Limited, thethird largest credit card issuer in Hong Kong, as well as consumer bankingactivities in Hong Kong, Panama and the Eastern Caribbean. CCS's operatingrevenues for the three months ended March 31, 1999 were $1.0 billion,representing an 8% increase from the first quarter 1998, reflecting increasedpurchase volume and the positive impact of pricing initiatives starting in the1998 second quarter. Cash operating earnings reflect a higher level of marketingexpense.Regional Consumer BankingRegional Consumer Banking has a leading share of primary bank relationshipsamong consumers and small businesses in the New York metropolitan tri-statearea. It is also a leading retail institution in key Texas markets. RegionalConsumer Banking offers customers convenient access to financial servicesthrough their choice of distribution channels, including the largest branch andproprietary ATM networks in the New York metropolitan region, plusstate-of-the-art telephone, PC and Internet services. For the first quarter1999, cash operating earnings increased 25% to $101 million, compared with thesame period in 1998, benefiting from higher net interest income and increasedfee income as a result of strong performance of the Chase debit banking card. -15-  16Chase Home FinanceChase Home Finance serves more than 2 million customers nationwide and is thelargest originator and third-largest servicer of residential mortgage loans inthe U.S. It is also a leading provider of home-equity secured lending andmanufactured housing financing. During the first three months of 1999, $28billion in residential first-mortgage loans, home-equity and manufacturedhousing financing were originated, a 73% increase over the same period lastyear. Chase Home Finance's servicing portfolio increased 27% from first quarter1998 and totaled $226 billion at March 31, 1999. Operating revenues rose 13% inthe first quarter of 1999 compared with the first quarter of 1998 due to higherorigination volume and servicing balances. Partially offsetting this increase inoperating revenue was lower net interest income as a result of higher fundingcosts associated with the increase in servicing balances. Cash operatingearnings decreased 2% in the first three months of 1999, reflecting higherexpenses stemming from greater business volume and technology investments.Diversified Consumer ServicesDiversified Consumer Services ("DCS") is the largest bank originator of autoloans and leases in the United States and a leading provider of student loansand unsecured consumer lending. In addition to its financing activities, DCSoffers brokerage services and investment products nationwide and is one of themost diversified bank insurance providers in the U.S. During the first quarter1999, auto finance originations were strong, increasing 14% when compared to thesame period in 1998. At March 31, 1999, Chase Auto Finance had $23 billion inmanaged loans and $18 billion in balance sheet receivables. Cash operatingearnings for DCS in the first quarter of 1999, were driven by the strong growthin auto finance and by higher revenues in Chase's investment and insurancebusinesses. Also included in revenues was a gain on a sale of a student loanportfolio.CHASE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSChase Technology Solutions ("CTS") is composed of Chase's Global Servicesbusinesses, Information Technology and Operations, and Electronic Commerceinitiatives. Global Services is a leading provider of information andtransaction services globally and includes custody and other investor services,treasury and cash management, trade finance, debt, agency and other fiduciaryservices. As the world's largest provider of global custody and a leader intrust and agency services, Global Services was custodian for over $5.0 trillionin assets and serviced over $3.0 trillion in outstanding debt at March 31, 1999.Global Services also operates the largest U.S. dollar funds transfer business inthe world and is a market leader in FedWire, ACH and CHIPS volume.For the three months ended March 31, 1999, cash operating earnings and SVA forGlobal Services decreased $5 million and $29 million, respectively, whencompared with the same period in 1998. Revenue growth increased 9% in the firstquarter 1999, driven by acquisitions and growth in core custody products.Revenue growth was negatively affected by a decline in balance-related revenues,the revaluation and reallocation of investment portfolios from emerging todeveloped markets, and by a reduction in structured financings. Expenses in thequarter grew more than revenues, reflecting ongoing investment spending andcosts related to Year 2000. Management anticipates that over the remainder of1999, Global Services operating results should improve when compared to thecurrent quarter, primarily as a result of expense discipline and increasingrevenues from rebounding financial markets.CORPORATECorporate includes Chase's Global Asset Management and Mutual Funds business,which provides investment management for institutional investors globally andmanages the Chase Global Mutual Funds. Total assets under management amounted to$208 billion at March 31, 1999. Corporate also includes Chase Business Services,the shared services company created in 1998, and the effects remaining at theCorporate level after the implementation of management accounting policies suchas credit provision and tax expense. For the three months ended March 31, 1999,Corporate had a cash operating loss (including the non-Global Services portionof CTS) of $62 million compared with a cash operating loss of $53 million in thefirst quarter of 1998.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following section provides a discussion of Chase's results of operations asreported under generally accepted accounting principles as well as on theoperating basis that is used by management in measuring Chase's financialperformance.To further facilitate its analysis of Chase's financial results, managementcategorizes Chase's revenue components as market-sensitive revenues or asless-market-sensitive revenues. Market-sensitive revenues include tradingrevenues (including trading-related net interest income), investment bankingfees, securities gains and private equity gains. The remaining revenuecomponents of the income statement are categorized as less-market-sensitiverevenue. -16-  17The following table provides a reconciliation between Chase's results asreported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and as presented on anoperating basis.(a) Represents results as reported in Chase's financial statements, except that revenues are categorized between market-sensitive revenues and less-market-sensitive revenues and restructuring costs have been separately displayed.(b) For purposes of operating basis presentation, the provision for risk management instrument credit losses is reclassified from noninterest revenue to credit costs and foreclosed property expense is reclassified from noninterest expense to credit costs.(c) This column excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. For securitized receivables, amounts that would previously have been reported as net interest income and as provision for loan losses are instead reported as components of noninterest revenue (credit card revenue and other revenue).(d) Includes restructuring costs and special items. For a description of special items, see Glossary of Terms on page 37.================================================================================ -17-  18MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUEMarket-sensitive revenues are, in management's view, typically more sensitive tochanges in general market conditions than those revenue components managementconsiders as less-market-sensitive. While components of market-sensitiverevenues experience volatility (particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis),over the past ten years total market-sensitive revenue has increased at acompound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 14% and has exhibited limited annualvolatility around the regression trendline.For the first quarter, market-sensitive revenues in 1999 increased 14% over1998, reflecting increases in trading-related revenues and securities gains. Adiscussion of the components within market-sensitive revenue is presented below.Investment Banking FeesInvestment banking fees were $317 million, 12 percent lower than in the same1998 quarter, reflecting the overall market decline in leveraged financings,offset in part by stronger fees in mergers and acquisitions advisory activityand investment grade bond underwriting. Chase continues to be a leading providerof corporate debt, ranking first in global loan syndications, while improvingits market share in public debt underwriting. Management anticipates thatrevenues from Investment Banking should rebound next quarter, as a result ofincreased leveraged financing activities.Trading-Related RevenueTrading revenues and related net interest income rose 21 percent to $837million, a new record, benefiting from strong performance in traditionalproducts, including interest rate derivatives, and newer products, such asequity derivatives.(a) Trading-related net interest income includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(b) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures and options, forward rate agreements and related hedges.(c) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.(d) Includes U.S. and foreign government and government agency securities, corporate debt instruments, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives, equity securities, equity derivatives and commodity derivatives.================================================================================Interest rate contract revenues increased as a result of Chase havingsuccessfully positioned itself for the commencement of the euro and frominterest rate movements in the European markets in the 1999 first quarter.Foreign exchange spot and option revenue declined this quarter, due to reducedvolume because of lower liquidity in the Asian markets.The increase in debt instruments, equities and commodities revenue resulted fromcontinued improvement in emerging markets activities and high-grade bonds aswell as from increased revenues from Chase's equity derivative products as aresult of favorable market conditions in the 1999 first quarter. Equities andcommodities revenue was $115 million in the 1999 first quarter compared with$74 million in the prior year quarter.Securities GainsSecurities gains realized for the 1999 first quarter were $156 million comparedwith $83 million in the prior year's first quarter. These gains were largelyfrom sales of U.S. Government and agency securities. Unrealized net losses inChase's available-for-sale securities portfolio were approximately $226 million,before taxes, at March 31, 1999, a decrease from a net unrealized gain ofapproximately $600 million, before taxes, at year-end 1998, reflecting a rise ininterest rates during the current quarter.Private Equity GainsPrivate equity gains include income from a wide variety of investments in theUnited States and, to a lesser extent, abroad. Private equity gains in the 1999first quarter were $325 million, 11 percent higher than in the first quarter of1998, reflecting continued strength in the equity markets and a more favorableenvironment for technology IPOs, as well as the positive impact of maturinginvestments within the portfolio. -18-  19LESS-MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUEThe less-market-sensitive revenue captions are generally subject to less marketvolatility than market-sensitive revenues. However, certain components withinless-market-sensitive revenue are subject to market volatility, particularlyassets that are held-for-sale and are accounted for on either a mark-to-marketbasis or lower-of-cost-or-market basis.Less-market-sensitive revenues increased by 8% in the 1999 first quarterreflecting increases across all categories. A discussion of the componentswithin less-market-sensitive revenue is presented below.Net Interest IncomeReported net interest income for the 1999 first quarter was $2.20 billion, anincrease of 2% from the 1998 first quarter. Reported results includetrading-related net interest income of $219 million, an increase of 3% from theprior year. For purposes of internal analysis, management combinestrading-related net interest income with trading revenue, as discussed under theTrading-Related Revenue caption in the Market-Sensitive Revenue section.The following table provides a reconciliation between reported net interestincome as presented on the Consolidated Statement of Income and operating netinterest income, which excludes trading-related net interest income and theimpact of credit card securitizations.(a) Disclosed on a taxable equivalent basis.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Operating net interest income was $2.31 billion in the 1999 first quarter, anincrease of 1% from 1998. The increase was primarily due to higher averagemanaged interest earning assets, particularly securities, domestic consumerloans (auto financings and residential mortgages), and domestic commercialloans. This increase was partially offset by a decline in the foreign commercialloan portfolio, as Chase significantly reduced its exposure to emerging marketsduring 1998. The growth in managed interest-earning assets in 1999 was funded byinterest-bearing deposits.The net yield on a managed basis was 3.62%, a decrease of 13 basis points incomparison with 1998. As a result of decreases in both the volume and rateearned on interest-free funds, interest-free funds contributed 62 basis pointsto the net yield in the first quarter of 1999, compared to 85 basis points inthe first quarter of 1998. -19-  20Trust, Custody and Investment Management FeesTrust, custody and investment management fees continued their strong performanceby increasing 19% to $414 million in the 1999 first quarter. These favorableresults were largely attributable to portfolio acquisitions of custody andcorporate trust businesses in late 1998 and growth in core custody products.Credit Card RevenueCredit card revenue on a reported basis rose $79 million, or 26%, in the 1999first quarter as a result of increased purchase volume and the implementation ofpricing initiatives starting in the 1998 second quarter.The following table provides a reconciliation between reported credit cardrevenue as presented on the Consolidated Statement of Income and operatingcredit card revenue, which excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.Fees for Other Financial Services(a) Insurance amount excludes certain insurance fees related to credit cards and mortgage products, which are included in those revenue captions.================================================================================ -20-  21The rise in fees in lieu of compensating balances reflects, in part, higher feesfor services paid by customers, rather than the customer maintaining a higherlevel of compensating balances. Mortgage servicing fees increased in the 1999first quarter largely due to a larger servicing balance. The servicing portfolioapproximated $226 billion at March 31, 1999, a 27% increase from prior yearlevels. Brokerage and investment services rose $11 million due to a significantincrease in transaction volume as a result of favorable market conditions, aswell as a price reduction implemented late in the first quarter of 1998. Higherfees related to insurance products reflected increased volume. Other fees rose21% for the first quarter 1999, when compared to the same period in 1998, mainlydue to increased business volume, ATM fees for non-Chase customers and new cashmanagement products.Other RevenueThe 1999 first quarter operating and reported results included higher revenuefrom residential mortgage originations and sales activities, a reflection of thecontinued favorable interest-rate environment. All other operating revenueincreased by $37 million in the 1999 first quarter as a result of a $25 milliongain from the sale of a student loan portfolio. Also contributing to theincrease was higher revenues from a portfolio of assets that had been previouslytransferred into a trust, the shares of which are being sold to institutionalinvestors. This trust was established late in the 1998 first quarter.NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal reported noninterest expense was $2.95 billion in the 1999 first quarter,a decrease of 6% from the prior year's first quarter. Operating noninterestexpense was $2.94 billion in the first quarter of 1999, 12% above the comparable1998 quarter, reflecting technology-related costs, incentive costs tied tohigher market-sensitive revenues and the impact of a change in the components ofthe long-term compensation program of the Global Bank. This change in thecompensation program (replacing options with restricted stock) contributed 2% tothe growth rate of salaries and employee benefits. Management of Chase expectsmoderating expense growth for the remainder of the year.(a) Included within Other Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. For purposes of reviewing the results on an operating basis, these expenses are reflected in Credit Costs.(b) Excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed property expense, provision for risk management instrument credit losses, costs associated with the REIT and special items.(c) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.================================================================================ -21-  22The increase in salaries and employee benefits for the first quarter 1999 wasdue to higher incentive costs, mainly driven by higher market-sensitive revenuesand the aforementioned change in the long-term compensation program of theGlobal Bank. Also contributing to the increase was the net addition of 3,063full-time equivalent employees as a result of growth in select businesses andacquisitions (particularly in the mortgage, credit card, and custody andfiduciary services businesses).Occupancy and Equipment ExpenseOccupancy expense increased $29 million in the 1999 first quarter, primarily dueto increased amortization of leasehold improvements from renovations resultingfrom business expansions and acquisitions. The higher level of equipment expenseduring the 1999 first quarter was due to an increase in depreciation expensefrom the capitalization of costs relating to more advanced hardware systemsacross all business units. Also contributing to the increase was higher softwareexpenses associated with Year 2000 efforts. For a further discussion of Year2000 efforts, see Operating Risk Management Section on page 32.Other Expense(a) Includes REIT minority interest expense of $11 million in each quarter.================================================================================Other expense for the 1999 first quarter increased $101 million when comparedwith the first quarter of 1998. Professional services costs for the firstquarter of 1999 reflects a higher level of contract computer professionalsassociated with Year 2000 efforts. The $24 million increase in marketing expensein the first three months of 1999 is primarily due to higher marketing costs atChase Cardmember Services. The $14 million rise in telecommunications costs inthe 1999 first quarter covers both installation and usage and reflects thegrowth in business volume at all of Chase's major business franchises. Thepurchase of a global custody business during the fourth quarter 1998 contributedto the increase in amortization of intangibles expense. All other expensesincreased $31 million, reflecting a growth in business volume at ChaseCardmember Services and the global custody acquisition.Restructuring CostsFor a discussion of Chase's restructuring costs, see Note Four on page 8 of thisForm 10-Q. It is anticipated that savings from the one-time charge of $510million, taken in the first quarter of 1998 in connection with initiatives tostreamline support functions and realign certain business functions, will amountto approximately $460 million annually. Depending on its view of revenueopportunities, Chase may or may not reinvest all or a portion of these savingsinto its revenue-generating activities. -22-  23CREDIT COSTSCredit costs include provisions for loan losses and for risk managementinstrument credit losses, foreclosed property expense and credit costsassociated with credit card securitizations.The following table shows the components of credit costs.(a) Included in Noninterest Revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(b) Included in Other Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.================================================================================Credit costs in the 1999 first quarter were $655 million, an increase of $27million from the 1998 level, primarily due to higher credit losses in thedomestic commercial portfolio and the credit card portfolio. For a discussion ofChase's net charge-offs, see page 25.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $645 million in the first quarter of 1999compared with $425 million in the first quarter of 1998. The effective tax rateswere 35.5% and 37.0%, respectively. -23-  24- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1998 and should be read in conjunction withpages 29-35 and 50-51 of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Represents the portion of Chase's credit card receivables that have been securitized.NM - Not meaningful================================================================================ -24-  25Chase's managed credit-related assets totaled $220 billion at March 31, 1999, adecrease of $4 billion, or 2%, compared with year-end 1998. The decrease wasprimarily due to lower derivative and foreign exchange receivables, while loanbalances remained relatively stable.Chase's nonperforming assets at March 31, 1999 increased $68 million, or 4%,from the 1998 year-end level primarily due to an increase in the nonperformingdomestic commercial loan portfolio. The foreign commercial loan portfolioremained stable during the 1999 first quarter.Total net charge-offs on a retained basis increased by $36 million during the1999 first quarter. Total net charge-offs on a managed basis were $649 millionin the 1999 first quarter, compared with $624 million in the first quarter of1998. The increases in net charge-offs on both a managed and retained basis aredue to increased charge-off levels in the retained credit card portfolio andlower recoveries in the domestic commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Theseincreases were partially offset by lower levels of securitized credit card andforeign commercial net charge-offs.Management expects that credit costs in 1999, on a managed basis, will remainrelatively stable over the remainder of 1999 and will be of a similar magnitudeto total credit costs incurred in 1998. For the consumer portfolio, managementexpects net charge-off rates will be approximately the same as in 1998; however,reported net charge-offs will vary depending on the level of credit cardsecuritizations completed during the year. The commercial charge-off rate variesmore than the consumer charge-off rate, and over time Chase expects annualcommercial net charge-offs to be in a range of 30-50 bp.Consumer Loan PortfolioResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans outstanding remainedstable at March 31, 1999, when compared with year-end balances, as did the levelof nonperforming domestic residential mortgage loans. The loss rate of .01% forthe 1999 first quarter was unusually low due to exceptionally high recoveries.This portfolio's asset quality continues to be strong.Credit Card Loans: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managed basis,which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well as creditcard receivables that have been securitized.Average managed credit card receivables for the three months ended March 31,1999 decreased 1% when compared with the same period in 1998. The increase inthe net charge-off percentage rate for the first quarter of 1999 was due toslower growth in credit card outstandings, driven by increased consumerliquidity. While credit costs increased from first quarter 1998, the charge-offrate declined from 1998 fourth quarter level, as a result of lower bankruptcylevels, higher recoveries and improvement in the credit quality of a portfolioacquired in 1998.Managed Credit Card Portfolio (a)(a) Includes domestic and international credit card activity.================================================================================Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased 7%, reflecting continuedstrong consumer demand due to favorable pricing programs. Total originationswere $3.4 billion in the first three months of 1999, an increase of 14% whencompared with the same 1998 period. The 1999 charge-off rate of .45% isindicative of the selective approach to asset origination. -25-  26Commercial PortfolioThe domestic commercial portfolio had net charge-offs of $36 million during the1999 first quarter, compared with $6 million in the prior year period. While thenet charge-off amount did increase during the 1999 first quarter, the netcharge-off rate of .27% for the portfolio remained at a low level, indicative ofthe portfolio's diversification and strong credit quality.The foreign commercial portfolio totaled $34.2 billion at March 31, 1999 andremained relatively stable when compared with the 1998 year-end. Nonperformingloan levels at March 31, 1999 also remained stable. Net charge-off levels forthe 1999 first quarter decreased in comparison with the prior year by $19million, or 27%, due to stabilizing financial conditions in Asia.Country ExposureThe following table presents Chase's country exposure to Asia and Latin America.Country disclosure is based on the Federal Financial Institutions ExaminationCouncil ("FFIEC") guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk.For a further discussion of Chase's country exposure, see pages 33-34 of Chase's1998 Annual Report.(a) Country exposure is based on the FFIEC guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. Under FFIEC guidelines, resale agreements are reported by the country of the issuer of the underlying security. Chase, however, does not consider the cross border risk of resale agreements to depend upon the country of the issuer of the underlying security and as a result, has presented these amounts separately in the above table.(b) Includes loans and accrued interest, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit and undrawn commitments to extend credit.(c) Includes cross-border trading debt and equity instruments and the mark-to-market exposure of foreign exchange and derivative contracts. The amounts associated with foreign exchange and derivative contracts are presented after taking into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.(d) Excludes Bermuda and Cayman Islands.================================================================================ -26-  27At March 31, 1999, Chase had approximately $97 million in lending and tradingrelated exposure to Russia. Chase also had approximately $83 million in resaleagreements with non-Russian counterparties collateralized by non-rubledenominated Russian debt.Chase significantly reduced its exposure to emerging markets in Asia and LatinAmerica from a year ago (by 35% and 20%, respectively) and further lowered itsexposure to Asia from year-end (by 6%). Total nonperforming assets in Asiaincreased by $27 million from 1998 year-end to $528 million at March 31, 1999.Asian commercial net charge-offs for the 1999 first quarter were $59 million,compared with $92 million, including derivatives, in 1998. There were nocharge-offs for Latin American commercial loans during the 1999 first quarter.Chase's management has recently completed a strategic review of its cross-borderactivities. As a result of that review, management believes that Chase's currentlevels of cross-border exposure reflect appropriate levels of business, market,credit and capital risk in light of Chase's cross-border business activitiesand, accordingly, management currently does not expect there will be significantchanges in Chase's cross-border exposures over the balance of 1999.Derivative and Foreign Exchange ContractsFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized inconnection with Chase's trading and ALM activities, see pages 34-35 and NotesOne and Nineteen of Chase's 1998 Annual Report. Chase's counterparties inderivatives and foreign exchange are primarily investment grade financialinstitutions, most of which are dealers in these products. The following tableprovides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreign exchange contractsoutstanding at March 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998. The lengthening of thematurity profile since year-end is the result of the improved creditworthinessof Chase over the last several years (as evidenced by credit rating upgrades)and the maturation of the derivatives market where longer maturities arebecoming more commonplace.Chase had no net charge-offs arising from derivative and foreign exchangetransactions in the 1999 first quarter compared with $12 million for the same1998 period. At March 31, 1999, nonperforming derivative contracts were $32million, compared with $50 million at December 31, 1998. The decreases in bothnet charge-offs and nonperforming derivative contracts were due to thestabilizing of financial conditions in Asia since the 1998 fourth quarter. -27-  28Allowance for Credit LossesThe following discussion of Chase's allowance for credit losses focusesprimarily on developments since December 31, 1998 and should be read inconjunction with page 35 and Notes One and Five of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.(a) During the third quarter of 1998, as part of the trading valuation process, the allowance for risk management instrument credit losses was increased by $75 million through the provision for credit losses, in response to the adverse market conditions in Asia and Russia.================================================================================Chase deems its allowance for credit losses at March 31, 1999 to be adequate(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that may currently exist for all creditactivities, but are not yet identifiable). Estimating losses is inherentlyuncertain and depends on many factors, including general macroeconomic andpolitical conditions, rating migration, structural changes within industrieswhich alter competitive positions, event risk, unexpected correlations withinthe portfolio, and other external factors such as legal and regulatoryrequirements. Chase periodically reviews such factors and reassesses theadequacy of the allowance for credit losses. -28-  29- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1998 and should be read in conjunction withpages 36-39 and Notes One and Nineteen of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.The total VAR for Chase's trading portfolio, market risk-related ALM portfolio,and aggregate portfolio as of and for the twelve-month period ended March 31,1999 were as follows:NM: Because the minimum and maximum VARs may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect.================================================================================Chase's average aggregate VAR (VAR for both trading and ALM activities) for thetwelve-month period ended March 31, 1999 was $64.0 million and at March 31, 1999was $76.5 million. Chase's aggregate average and period-end VARs are less thanthe sum of the respective trading and ALM VARs shown in the above table (by$21.9 million and $16.6 million, respectively) due to risk offsets, resultingfrom portfolio diversification which occurs across the trading and ALMportfolios.Chase conducts daily VAR backtesting for both regulatory compliance with theBasle Committee on Banking Supervision market risk capital rules and forinternal evaluation of VAR against trading revenues. For mark-to-marketactivities, there were 2 days during the twelve months ended March 31, 1999 inwhich a daily trading loss exceeded that day's VAR. These losses occurred duringthe third quarter of 1998 and resulted from the adverse market conditions ineffect at that time.The following chart contains a histogram of Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of mark-to-market tradingportfolios plus any trading-related net interest income or other revenue. Basedon actual trading results for the twelve months ended March 31, 1999, Chaseposted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 226 out of 259 businesstrading days, with 56 business days exceeding positive $20 million. Chaseincurred six daily trading losses in excess of negative $20 million over thepast twelve months. Five of the six daily trading losses occurred in the 1998third quarter and resulted from the adverse global market conditions of thatperiod. -29-  30 [Graphic of Daily Changes in Market Risk-Related Revenue - See Appendix I]Asset/Liability ManagementMeasuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: As noted in the 1998 Annual Report,oversight of Chase's ALM interest rate risk and Market Risk Management functionswas consolidated under the Market Risk Committee at the beginning of 1999. Atthat time, Chase began to extend the market risk procedures and measurementsutilized for its trading and investment portfolios to its ALM activities.Chase, as part of its ALM process, employs a variety of instruments, includingsecurities and derivatives in managing its exposure to fluctuations in interestrates. In the past, Chase has presented its market risk exposure in the form ofan aggregate net gap position. In net gap analysis, assets, liabilities andderivative instruments are placed in gap intervals based on their repricingdates. For a more complete discussion of gap analysis, see page 38 of the 1998Annual Report. Although gap analysis is a widely used representation of interestrate risk, it is limited in that it does not include the impact of factors suchas basis risk. Basis risk results from the fact that assets may be repriced on adifferent interest rate index than liabilities (for instance, LIBOR vs. primerate repricing). In addition, the position risk presented in gap analysis cannotreveal the impact of other factors, such as pricing strategies on consumer andbusiness deposits or changes in balance sheet mix, on Chase's earnings oreconomic value.In order to improve its management of interest rate exposure and as part of theconvergence of the ALM and market risk management processes, Chase implementedduring the first quarter of 1999 a new measure to estimate the potential changein value to Chase's ALM portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Thisnew measure is used in conjunction with existing earnings simulation measures.The new measure, which is called "Basis Point Value" (BPV), quantifies thechange in the value of Chase's non-trading on- and off- balance sheet positionsthat would result from a 1 basis point change in interest rates. This samemeasure is also used to quantify the economic value sensitivity of thenon-trading on- and off- balance sheet positions to basis risk.At March 31, 1999, Chase had a BPV value of $4.0 million (pre-tax), indicatingthat the economic value of Chase's non-trading on- and off- balance sheetpositions would decline $4.0 million for every 1 basis point increase ininterest rates, assuming all rates moved in parallel together. This compareswith a BPV of $6.4 million at December 31, 1998. The BPV measure is generally"symmetrical"; that is, a 1 basis point decrease in interest rates at March 31,1999 would result in a $4.0 million (pre-tax) increase in Chase's economicvalue. The BPV measure includes exposure to U.S. dollar interest rates as wellas exposure to non-U.S. dollar interest rates in currency markets in which Chasedoes business. Since U.S. dollar interest rates and non-U.S. dollar interestrates may not move in tandem, the reported BPV value may not represent theactual change in economic value of Chases' ALM portfolio. -30-  31At March 31, 1999, based on Chase's simulation models and applying immediateincreases to various market interest rates, earnings at risk over the nexttwelve months are estimated to be approximately 3% of projected 1999 net income.Chase's earnings at risk to an immediate rise in interest rates was on averageless than 4% of projected net income for 1998. The hypothetical rate shocks areused to calculate risk that Chase believes to be reasonably possible ofoccurring in the near term, but these scenarios do not necessarily representmanagement's current view of future market interest rate developments.Impact of ALM Derivative Activity:The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's ALM activities at March 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.(a) These net unrecognized gains/(losses) do not include the net unfavorable/(favorable) impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following liquidity and capital discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 40-41 and Note Eighteen ofChase's 1998 Annual Report.LiquidityDuring the first quarter of 1999, Chase issued $1.1 billion of long-term debt,offsetting $950 million of long-term debt that matured and $127 million that wasredeemed.CapitalChase's capital levels at March 31, 1999 remained strong, with capital ratioswell in excess of regulatory guidelines. At March 31, 1999, the Tier 1 and TotalCapital ratios were 8.4% and 12.2%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 6.6%.Management believes a reasonable long-term growth rate for balance sheet assetsis approximately 6% - 7%. However, management anticipates that growth in balancesheet assets in the near term will be below these levels as a result ofcontinued focus on removing non-positive SVA assets from the balance sheet. Inthe 1999 first quarter, the Tier 1 capital ratio increased from year-end 1998,notwithstanding net equity purchases during the quarter of approximately $885million. Management intends to continue Chase's disciplined approach to assetgrowth utilizing SVA. Management's current intention is to target a Tier 1 ratioin the range of 8% to 8.25% over the long term, recognizing that the Tier 1ratio may be outside that range from time to time, as it was at the end of thefirst quarter of 1999. Capital generated in excess of this target ratio will beused to purchase Chase common stock or for future reinvestment and acquisitionopportunities.The following table shows the sources and uses of Chase's free cash flow. -31-  32In the first quarter of 1999, Chase raised the cash dividend on its common stockto $.41 per share from $.36 per share. Chase has over the past several yearsbeen paying a common stock dividend that has generally been equal toapproximately 25% to 35% of Chase's operating net income, less preferred stockdividends. Chase's future dividend policies will be determined by its Board ofDirectors taking into consideration Chase's earnings and financial condition andapplicable governmental regulation and policies.Under a new repurchase program, effective January 4, 1999, Chase may repurchaseup to $3 billion of its common stock in the open market or through negotiatedtransactions, in addition to any amounts that may need to be purchased toprovide for issuances under Chase's dividend reinvestment plan and its variousstock-based employee benefit plans. As of March 31, 1999, Chase repurchasednet $885 million.At March 31, 1999, the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier2 capital) was $34.9 billion, an increase of $114 million from December 31,1998. This increase reflects retained earnings (net income less common andpreferred dividends) generated during the period and new debt issuancesqualifying as Tier 2 capital, partially offset by common stock repurchases.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's operating risk management focuses primarilyon developments since December 31, 1998.Year 2000: Chase's Year 2000 efforts, including a description of each of theitems listed in the table below, are discussed on pages 41-42 of Chase's 1998Annual Report. The information below updates Chase's Year 2000 disclosures.During the 1999 first quarter, Chase continued to make progress on its Year 2000remediated and testing efforts. The following table sets forth Chase's progressin the first quarter, as compared with its forecast as reported in the 1998Annual Report, and its forecast of progress for June 30, 1999.(a) The actual percent remediated is 99.7%.(b) While activities are scheduled to be completed by the dates indicated, efforts will continue around external testing and certification throughout the year.(c) For Business Software Applications, of the 99% of the systems remediated, 95% have also been tested to be Year 2000 compliant. For the remaining types of systems listed in the table, the percent remediated also indicates the percent tested to be Year 2000 compliant.================================================================================As remediation of systems is completed, attention is being directed to ensuringthat those software application systems that have been remediated, tested andcertified as Year 2000-compliant remain compliant. This entails continuedre-certification of systems throughout the remainder of the year. In addition,Chase is increasing its tracking and risk management of third party providers.Another major focus of 1999 will be continued customer and "street" (i.e.,industry-wide) testing. Chase expects to participate in industry tests as theyare scheduled throughout 1999. As just one example, in the second weekend ofJune, the Federal Reserve Board, The New York Clearing House and the Society forWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication will conduct a cross-border testof the major global payments systems. Testing with third parties is critical,since a failure of a major external interface could have a material adverseeffect on Chase's operations. -32-  33 Chase's Year 2000 testing methods include a technique for future datesimulation, testing in the isolated environments of time machines, and theselected use of independent validation and verification. Time machines arecomputer configurations created to allow systems to be tested in an environmentwhere the system clock has been set to a date in the future. These environmentsallow the operation of all system components together to confirm they willinteract and operate properly before, through, and after the century datechange. Independent validation and verification is a means of uncoveringpotential Year 2000 errors in remediated code that may have been missed intesting. Independent systems analysts, utilizing sophisticated Year 2000 codeanalytic tools, have been contracted by Chase to identify remaining potentialYear 2000 errors for a majority of Chase's internal mission-critical softwareapplications. If any are found, the affected programs will be corrected immediately and retested.Chase's Business Risk Council, established January 1, 1999, has also been activeduring the 1999 first quarter in identifying potential business risks andcoordinating business planning and readiness efforts related to the Year 2000.The Council's focus this quarter has been on: business continuity andcontingency planning; procedures for early identification of any operational,credit, liquidity, market or legal risks that may arise as a result of the Year2000; and communication plans that will enable appropriate business units tocoordinate their contingency efforts.At March 31, 1999, Chase's cost estimate to remediate its Year 2000 issuesremains at approximately $363 million. This includes costs incurred during 1997and 1998 as well as costs expected to be incurred during 1999. Chase currentlyestimates that full year 1999 Year 2000 costs will be approximately $127million. Chase's Year 2000 cost estimate includes remediation, testing, thirdparty assessment, and contingency planning, but do not include approximately $33million of depreciation costs for Year 2000-compliant equipment that will beexpensed beyond December 31, 1999.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-4 of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.DividendsChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $2.9 billion atMarch 31, 1999.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------DerivativesIn June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, which establishes accounting andreporting standards for all derivative instruments, including certain derivativeinstruments embedded in other financial instruments (collectively referred to asderivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that an entitymeasure all derivatives at fair value and recognize those derivatives as eitherassets or liabilities in the balance sheet. The change in a derivative's fairvalue is generally recognized in current period earnings. However, if certainconditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of anexposure to changes in fair value, variability of cash flows, or certain foreigncurrency exposures. Based on the hedge designation, special hedge accountingrules allow the derivative's change in value to be recognized either in currentperiod earnings together with the offsetting change in value of the risk beinghedged, or, to the extent the hedge is effective, in comprehensive income andsubsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999(calendar year 2000), with early adoption permitted.
