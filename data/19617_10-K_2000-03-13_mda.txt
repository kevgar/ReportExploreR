For a discussion of nonaccrual loan and past due loan policies, see NoteOne on page 61. Renegotiated loans are those for which concessions, such as thereduction of interest rates or the deferral of interest or principal payments,have been granted due to a deterioration in the borrowers' financial condition.Interest on renegotiated loans is accrued at the renegotiated rates. Certainrenegotiated loan agreements call for additional interest to be paid on adeferred or contingent basis. Such interest is recognized in income only ascollected.Impact of Nonperforming Loans on Interest IncomeThe following table presents the amount of interest income recorded by Chase onits nonperforming loans and the amount of interest income on the carrying valueof these loans that would have been recorded if these loans had been current inaccordance with their original terms (i.e., interest at original rates). Theincreases in both 1999 and 1998 in total negative impact on interest incomereflect a higher level of interest that was not recognized in income due to theincreased levels of nonperforming loans. 97  99SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCEFor a further discussion, see Note One on page 61 and Note Five on page 67.Allowance for Loan LossesThe table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses duringthe periods indicated.(a) Includes $160 million in 1997 related to the purchase of a credit card portfolio and $28 million related to the sale of banking operations in southern and central New Jersey in 1995.(a) Includes a charge of $102 million related to conforming credit card charge-off policies.98  100DEPOSITSThe following data provides a summary of the average balances and averageinterest rates of Chase's various deposits for the years indicated:(a) The majority of foreign deposits were in denominations of $100,000 or more.At December 31, 1999, other domestic time deposits in denominations of $100,000or more totaled $18,401 million, substantially all of which mature in 3 monthsor less.
