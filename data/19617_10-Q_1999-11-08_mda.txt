MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) OPERATING BASIS excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs and special items. For a further discussion, see Glossary of Terms on page 41.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Chase's 1999 third quarter operating earnings were $1.19 billion, dilutedearnings per share on an operating basis were $1.37, and return on averagecommon equity was 22%. Operating earnings and diluted earnings per shareincreased 61% and 67%, respectively, from the third quarter of 1998. For thenine months of 1999, operating earnings and diluted earnings per share rose 29%and 33%, respectively, from the nine months of 1998.Reported diluted earnings per share were $1.37 in the 1999 third quarter, anincrease of 46% from the same period in 1998. For the nine months of 1999,reported diluted earnings per share were $4.30, 47% higher than the same prioryear period. Reported net income in the 1999 third quarter and for the firstnine months of 1999 increased 42% from the same 1998 periods. For areconciliation of Chase's results as reported in its consolidated financialstatements and as presented on an operating basis, see page 19.Operating highlights for the third quarter of 1999 included: - Operating revenues of $5.4 billion, an increase of 26%. - Operating earnings per share of $1.37, an increase of 67%. - Return on average common stockholders' equity ("ROCE") of 22%, with Shareholder Value Added (SVA) of $539 million. - Common stock repurchases of $780 million, on a net basis, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.2%.The strong 1999 third quarter results continued to demonstrate Chase'sdisciplined approach to managing capital and making investments that propelfuture growth. BUSINESS FRANCHISES: Each of Chase's three business franchises, GlobalBanking, National Consumer Services and Global Services, produced third quartercash operating earnings growth of 25% or more and a return on equity in excessof 20%. In Global Banking, the efficiency ratio was better than 50%, with a cashROCE of 21%, for the 1999 third quarter. Chase's investment banking businessescontinued to gain market share and improve its rankings in league tables. Forthe nine months of 1999 in the U.S., Chase ranked #1 in loan syndications, #3 inboth high yield and investment grade corporate debt securities, and #8 in mergerand acquisition advisory. In Global Services, revenue and cash operatingearnings growth for the 1999 third quarter were 13% and 25%, respectively.National Consumer Services had revenue growth of 9%, and when combined withimprovements in asset quality and expense management, resulted in income growthof 25%. -12-  13 FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE: Expense, credit and capital discipline also contributedto the results. Total operating noninterest expense for the third quarter wasalmost flat when compared to the 1999 second quarter. Chase continues to manageits operating noninterest expense to support its revenue growth. Credit costsremained stable with second quarter 1999. Although nonperforming assetsincreased from the second quarter due to a single foreign customer,nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets remained low at .54%.Finally, the capital discipline imposed by Chase's Shareholder Value Added("SVA") methodology enabled Chase to repurchase $780 million of its common stockon a net basis during the 1999 third quarter, while maintaining a Tier 1capital ratio at 8.2%.STRATEGIC PRIORITIES: Actions during the third quarter continue to demonstrateChase's strategic priorities: a commitment to use resources to strengthenits competitive positions where it has leadership positions. Recent investmentsby Chase include an acquisition of a major mortgage business, a private-labelcredit card acquisition and the pending acquisition of Hambrecht & Quist.Progress also continued on Chase.com initiatives, including an initial publicoffering by Shopnow.com, an internet company in which Chase has both an equityinvestment and a credit card alliance; and an equity investment in Intellisys,an e-commerce procurement company.Chase has targeted its financial performance goals over time as: -average ROCE of 18% or higher -growth in operating revenues accelerating to 10% per year -double-digit growth in operating earnings per shareThis Management's Discussion and Analysis contains certain forward-lookingstatements, including without limitation, statements related to credit, market,liquidity and operating risk. These forward-looking statements are subject torisks and uncertainties and Chase's actual results may differ materially fromthose included in these statements. Reference is made to Chase's reports filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the 1998 AnnualReport, for a discussion of factors that may cause such differences to occur.See Glossary of Terms on page 41 for a definition of terms used throughout thisForm 10-Q.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basis forChase's three major business franchises. For a description of the basis ofpresentation that management uses to measure and evaluate business unitprofitability, see page 19 of the 1998 Annual Report.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) CASH OPERATING EARNINGS represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles.(b) Total column includes Corporate results.

See description of Corporate results on page 18.bp - Denotes basis points; 100bp equals 1%.Note: The Middle Market business, which previously reported into the Global Bank franchise, now reports into the National Consumer Services franchise. The Global Assets Management and Mutual Funds business, which previously was in Corporate, now reports into the Global Bank franchise. Prior periods have been restated.================================================================================GLOBAL BANKGlobal Bank combines the strengths of a leading commercial bank and a leadinginvestment bank to meet the needs of corporations, institutions, governments andwealthy individuals around the world. With operations in approximately 50countries, including major operations in all key international financialcenters, Global Bank integrates a broad range of leading product capabilities,industry knowledge and geographic reach to produce superior customer solutions.Cash operating earnings in the 1999 third quarter were more than double theamount in the same quarter of the prior year, but less than the record breakingsecond quarter 1999, when Chase benefited from unusually high market-sensitiverevenues. For the Global Bank, the 1999 third quarter results were significantlyhigher than the prior year quarter, as the 1998 third quarter results reflectedthe adverse market conditions in effect at that time. The 1999 third quarterresults continued to reflect Chase's strong competitive position. The efficiencyratio was better than 50%, with a cash ROCE of 21%, for the 1999 third quarter.For the nine months of 1999, operating revenues and cash operating earningsincreased 25% and 37%, respectively, over the same period in 1998. Thesefavorable results were driven by strong trading-related revenue, investmentbanking fees and private equity gains, partially offset by lower securitiesgains. Chase anticipates that the financial markets may slow down later in the1999 fourth quarter, as corporations and customers prepare for the Year 2000implementation. -14-  15================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Other Global Bank includes Chase's Global Asset Management and Mutual Funds business and discontinued operations. Total assets under management amounted to $211 billion at September 30, 1999.NM - Not meaningfulbp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================GLOBAL MARKETSGlobal Markets' activities are diverse, by product and geography, and encompassthe trading and sale of foreign exchange, derivatives, fixed income securitiesand commodities. Chase trades 24 hours a day covering the major cross-borderfinancial markets, as well as many local markets. Also included within GlobalMarkets are Chase's domestic and international treasury units, which have theprimary responsibility for managing Chase's interest rate risk exposures andinvestment securities activities. Treasury results are managed on a total returnbasis with one of the primary objectives being the creation of economic valueover time. Total return combines reported revenues (net interest income andsecurities gains/losses) and the change in the net unrealizedappreciation/depreciation of all financial instruments and underlying balancesheet items.Chase's trading-related revenues for the third quarter and nine months of 1999were $679 million and $2,249 million, respectively. The results reflect strongperformance in traditional products, including interest rate derivatives, and inother products such as equity derivatives. The total return (pretax beforeexpenses) from interest rate risk management activities amounted to $(14)million and $226 million for the third quarter and nine months of 1999, comparedwith $351 million and $529 million for the third quarter and nine months of1998, respectively. The decline in total return is due to the significant risein interest rates during 1999.GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKINGGlobal Investment Banking advises corporations, financial institutions,financial sponsors and governments by providing integrated financial solutionsand industry expertise to clients globally. Chase's corporate finance clientbase is extensive and is managed through global client industry groups. Productofferings encompass syndicated finance, high yield securities, mergers andacquisitions advisory, project finance, real estate advisory and placement,restructuring and private placements. Chase is the largest arranger of U.S.corporate debt, with a major presence in both the public and private debtmarkets, and has built a strong presence in the advisory area by leveraging itsdebt market leadership. -15-  16Cash operating earnings for Global Investment Banking rose 571% in the thirdquarter of 1999 to $94 million, when compared with the same quarter in 1998,reflecting continued growth in market share in mergers and acquisitionsadvisory, high-yield bond underwriting, and loan syndications. For the ninemonths of 1999, cash operating earnings increased 13%, reflecting the stronggrowth over the past two quarters partially offset by the impact of lowertrading results on high-yield securities during the first quarter of 1999.CORPORATE LENDINGCorporate Lending provides credit and lending services to clients globallywithin a strategy that emphasizes origination for distribution. An activeportfolio management effort is an integral part of corporate lending activitiesand is focused on managing concentrations by product, borrower, risk grade,industry and geography. The use of SVA for product and customer decisionsresulted in higher spreads on retained assets and the disposition ofless-SVA-attractive loans. Management expects to continue to manage thecommercial loan portfolio for shareholder value rather than revenue growth. Inaddition, as the largest structurer and syndicator of commercial loans, Chaseoriginates loans for distribution to other financial institutions. In thisprocess, Chase targets retaining, for its own account, approximately 9% of theprincipal amount of the loan. Revenues and cash operating earnings in the thirdquarter of 1999 remained flat when compared with the 1998 third quarter. For thenine months of 1999, revenues increased 1%, while cash operating earningsincreased 7%, reflecting lower credit costs.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERSChase Capital Partners ("CCP") is one of the largest global private equityorganizations with approximately $8.5 billion under management, including $5.7billion in direct equity and equity-related investments and $1.6 billion in fundinvestments. CCP provides equity and mezzanine financing for a wide variety ofinvestment opportunities in the United States and, to a lesser extent, abroad.During the nine months of 1999, CCP's direct investments totaled approximately$1.5 billion in 102 venture capital, management buyout, recapitalization, growthequity and mezzanine transactions, compared with approximately $1.2 billion in84 direct investments for the nine months of 1998. Earnings reflected continuedstrength in the equity markets, a favorable environment for technology andinternet initial public offerings (IPOs) (particularly in the second and thirdquarters of 1999), and the positive impact of maturing investments within theportfolio, partially offset by higher costs to support a higher level ofinvestments.GLOBAL PRIVATE BANKThe Global Private Bank serves a global client base of high net worthindividuals and families, offering a full range of private banking services aswell as access to the broad product capabilities of the Global Bank. Servicesinclude investment management, global capital market products and services, riskmanagement, alternative investments such as private equity funds, trust andestate planning, global custody, mutual funds, credit and banking, andphilanthropic advisory services. Revenues for the third quarter and the ninemonths of 1999 grew 8% and 4%, when compared with the same 1998 periods. Therevenue growth in the business continues to reflect strong growth rates in theU.S. Cash operating earnings increased 7% and decreased 5% for the third quarterand nine months of 1999, respectively, from comparable 1998 periods, reflectingan increase in expenses due primarily to on-going technology and productivityinitiatives.NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICESNational Consumer Services ("NCS") serves more than 30 million customersnationwide offering a wide variety of financial products and services through adiverse array of channels. Characterized by significant scale, and operatingunder the strong Chase brand, NCS combines nationwide presence with a leadingconsumer and small business banking franchise in the New York metropolitantri-state region and key Texas markets.For the third quarter and nine months of 1999, NCS's cash operating earningsincreased $87 million and $227 million, respectively, over the same 1998periods. These increases in cash operating earnings are attributable to growthin origination and servicing volume of residential mortgages and auto loans,higher deposit levels and higher fees including increased level of customeractivity through Brown & Company, Chase's discount brokerage firm.Management expects that the rate of growth in NCS revenues for the fourthquarter of 1999 (in comparison to the same quarter of 1998) to be somewhat lowerthan the 10% year-to-date growth rate. This anticipated moderation in growthrate will be due, in part, to pricing initiatives in the latter part of 1998. -16-  17================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------NM - Not meaningfulbp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICESChase Cardmember Services ("CCS") ranks as the fifth-largest card issuer in theUnited States. CCS also reflects the results of Chase's international consumerbusiness, which includes Chase Manhattan Card Company Limited, the third largestcredit card issuer in Hong Kong, as well as consumer banking activitiesprimarily in Hong Kong. At September 30, 1999, CCS had a $33 billion world-widemanaged credit card portfolio. CCS's cash operating earnings for the thirdquarter of 1999 were $133 million, a 36% increase over 1998. Cash operatingearnings for the nine months of 1999 rose 17% to $383 million. The increases incash operating earnings reflect higher card usage, pricing initiatives startedin late 1998 and improved credit quality. These favorable results were partiallyoffset by higher marketing costs.REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKINGRegional Consumer Banking has a leading share of primary bank relationshipsamong consumers and small businesses in the New York metropolitan tri-state areaand is a leading retail institution in key Texas markets. Regional ConsumerBanking offers customers convenient access to financial services through theirchoice of distribution channels, including the largest branch and proprietaryATM networks in the New York metropolitan region, plus telephone, PC andInternet services. For the third quarter and nine months of 1999, cash operatingearnings increased 11% to $103 million and 18% to $304 million, respectively,compared with the same periods in 1998, benefiting from higher deposit levelscoupled with growth in consumer banking fees and strong expense discipline.CHASE HOME FINANCEChase Home Finance serves more than 3.2 million customers nationwide and is thelargest originator and servicer of residential mortgage loans (after theacquisition of the Mellon Mortgage business on September 30, 1999) in the U.S.It is also a leading provider of home-equity secured lending and manufacturedhousing financing. During the nine months of 1999, $79 billion in residentialfirst-mortgage loans, home-equity and manufactured housing financing wereoriginated, a 40% increase over the same period last year. Managementanticipates a decline in origination volume for the fourth quarter of 1999compared with the same period in the prior year, as a result of increasinginterest rates. Chase Home Finance's servicing portfolio increased 58% over thepast twelve months and totaled $301 billion at September 30, 1999. Cashoperating earnings increased 18% to $73 million and 15% to $205 million for thethird quarter and nine months of 1999, respectively. The increases were fueledby growth in originations and servicing revenue, partially offset by lower netinterest income as a result of higher funding costs associated with the increasein servicing balances and higher expenses stemming from greater business volumeand technology investments. -17-  18DIVERSIFIED CONSUMER SERVICESDiversified Consumer Services ("DCS") is one of the largest bank originator ofauto loans and leases in the United States and a leading provider of studentloans and unsecured consumer lending. In addition to its financing activities,DCS offers brokerage services and investment products nationwide and is one ofthe most diversified bank insurance providers in the U.S. At September 30, 1999,Chase Auto Finance had $24 billion in managed receivables including $21 billionin balance sheet receivables. Cash operating earnings increased 80% in the firstnine months of 1999 and was driven by the strong growth in auto finance and byhigher revenues in Chase's investment and insurance businesses, offset partiallyby higher expenses due to increased business volumes. Also included in revenuesfor the nine months of 1999 were $49 million of gains on sales of student loans,which occurred in the first half of 1999 and reflected a shift to a loanorigination and sale strategy.MIDDLE MARKETSChase is the premier provider of financial services to middle-market companies(companies with sales ranging from $10 million to $500 million) regionally, witha national focus in selected industries. It is the market leader in the New Yorkmetropolitan tri-state area. Cash operating earnings increased in the thirdquarter and nine months of 1999, compared with the respective 1998 periods,reflecting growth in loan volume along with improved credit quality anddisciplined expense management.GLOBAL SERVICESGlobal Services is a leading provider of information and transaction servicesglobally and includes custody, cash management, trust and other fiduciaryservices. As the world's largest provider of global custody and a leader intrust and agency services, Global Services was custodian for over $5 trillion inassets and serviced over $3 trillion in outstanding debt at September 30, 1999.Global Services also operates the largest U.S. dollar funds transfer business inthe world and is a market leader in FedWire, ACH and CHIPS volume.For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999, cash operatingearnings for Global Services increased $30 million and $48 million,respectively, when compared with the same periods in 1998. Revenue growth was13% in the third quarter and 12% for the nine months of 1999, driven in part byacquisitions completed in 1998. These increases were offset partially by adecline in excess deposit balances in cash management services. Expenses for thenine months of 1999 were higher than the same period in 1998, reflecting ongoinginvestment spending and costs related to Year 2000 initiatives.Management expects that the rate of growth in Global Services revenue for thefourth quarter of 1999 (in comparison to the same quarter of 1998) may be lowerthan the 12% year-to-date growth rate. This anticipated moderation in thegrowth rate is due to the inclusion of revenues from an acquisition in the 1998fourth quarter and the possibility of lower business transaction volume as aresult of customer concerns involving the Year 2000.CORPORATECorporate includes Chase.com and the effects remaining at the Corporate levelafter the implementation of management accounting policies. Chase.com has adirect management responsibility for new internet related ventures and forworking with Chase's lines of businesses to capitalize on internetopportunities.For the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999, Corporate had acash operating loss of $2 million and $89 million, respectively, compared withcash operating earnings of $32 million and a cash operating loss of $45 millionfor the same periods in 1998. Prior periods have been restated to reflectrefinements in management reporting policies or changes to the managementorganization.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following section provides a discussion of Chase's results of operations asreported under generally accepted accounting principles as well as on theoperating basis that is used by management in measuring Chase's financialperformance. -18-  19The following table provides a reconciliation between Chase's results asreported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and as presented on anoperating basis. Charge-offs and provisions for risk management instruments,included in credit costs prior to 1999, are now netted against trading revenue.All prior periods have been restated.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Represents results as reported in Chase's financial statements, except that revenues are categorized between market-sensitive and less-market-sensitive revenues, foreclosed property expense is reclassified from noninterest expense to credit costs, and restructuring costs have been separately displayed. Market-sensitive revenues include trading revenues (including trading-related net interest income), investment banking fees, securities gains and private equity gains.(b) This column excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. For securitized receivables, amounts that would previously have been reported as net interest income and as provision for loan losses are instead reported as components of noninterest revenue (credit card revenue and other revenue).(c) Includes restructuring costs and special items. For a description of special items, see Glossary of Terms on page 41.================================================================================ -19-  20MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUEMarket-sensitive revenues are, in management's view, typically more sensitive tochanges in general market conditions than those revenue components managementconsiders as less-market-sensitive. While components of market-sensitiverevenues experience volatility (particularly on a quarter-to-quarter basis),over the past ten years total market-sensitive revenues have increased at acompound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of approximately 14% and have exhibitedlimited annual volatility around the regression trendline.For the third quarter and nine months, market-sensitive revenues in 1999increased 114% and 41%, respectively, over the same 1998 periods, reflectingincreases in trading-related revenues, investment banking fees and privateequity gains. Chase anticipates that the financial markets in the latter part ofthe 1999 fourth quarter may slow down, as corporations and customers preparefor the Year 2000 implementation.INVESTMENT BANKING FEESInvestment banking fees of $486 million in the 1999 third quarter were up 51%from the prior-year quarter and represent the second highest quarter for Chase,immediately following the record 1999 second quarter results. Fees of $1,388million for the nine months of 1999 were 24% higher than the nine months of1998. These strong results reflect market share gains in loan syndications,mergers and acquisitions advisory, and corporate bond underwriting, as Chaseleverages its broad customer base and leadership positions in attractivemarkets.TRADING-RELATED REVENUETrading revenues and related net interest income increased to $679 million forthe 1999 third quarter and to $2,249 million for the first nine months of 1999.The results reflect strong performance across a wide variety of tradingproducts.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Charge-offs for risk management instruments are included in trading revenue. All prior periods have been restated.(b) Trading-related net interest income includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(c) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures and options, forward rate agreements and related hedges.(d) Includes equity securities, equity derivatives, commodities and commodity derivatives.(e) Includes U.S. and foreign government agency securities, corporate debt instruments, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives and credit derivatives.================================================================================Interest rate contract revenue increased in the third quarter and nine months of1999 as a result of interest rate movements in the European markets. Foreignexchange spot and option contract revenue declined in the third quarter and forthe nine months of 1999, due to reduced volume because of a return to normalvolatility in the Asian markets. Equities and commodities revenue increased forboth 1999 periods as a result of favorable market conditions for equityderivative products throughout the nine months of 1999. The increase in debtinstruments and other resulted from continued improvement in emerging marketsactivities and high-grade bonds due to the unsettled markets in the 1998third quarter.Chase disclosed on November 1, 1999 that trading revenues in the fourth quarterwould be reduced by approximately $60 million before tax ($40 million after tax)as a result of a correction of trading revenues from previous periods. -20-  21SECURITIES GAINSSecurities losses realized for the 1999 third quarter were $1 million, comparedwith securities gains of $261 million in the prior year's third quarter. The1998 third quarter gains were largely from sales of U.S. Government and agencysecurities. Due to adverse market conditions during the 1998 third quarter, manyinvestors chose safer investments, such as U.S. Treasuries. Total securitiesgains for the nine months of 1999 were $160 million, a 64% decrease over thesame period in 1998. The decline in securities gains was due to a lower level ofsales as a result of higher market interest rates, which reduced the marketvalue of these securities. Unrealized net losses in Chase's available-for-salesecurities portfolio were approximately $1.8 billion, before taxes, at September30, 1999, a decrease from a net unrealized gain of approximately $.6 billion,before taxes, at year-end 1998, reflecting a rise in interest rates during 1999.The market valuation does not include the favorable impact of changes ininterest rates on related funding.PRIVATE EQUITY GAINSPrivate equity gains include income from a wide variety of investments in theUnited States and, to a lesser extent, abroad. Private equity gains in the thirdquarter and nine months of 1999 were $317 million higher and $492 million higher(an increase of 68%) than the same periods in the prior year. These resultsreflect gains on investments in companies that had initial public offerings in1999 and on sales of companies in the telecommunications and internetmarketplace. The 1999 third quarter results, while less than the 1999 secondquarter, continued to be strong, despite a decline in the market value of alarge investment.LESS-MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUEThe less-market-sensitive revenue captions are generally subject to less marketvolatility than market-sensitive revenues. However, certain components withinless-market-sensitive revenue are subject to market volatility, particularlyassets that are held-for-sale and are accounted for on either a mark-to-marketbasis or lower-of-cost-or-market basis.Less-market-sensitive revenues increased by 8% in both the 1999 third quarterand first nine months reflecting across the board increases in all categoriesfor both periods.NET INTEREST INCOMEReported net interest income ("NII") was $2.17 billion for the 1999 thirdquarter and $6.52 billion for the 1999 nine months. Excluding the impact of $191million of interest income resulting from prior years' tax refunds which wasrecognized in the 1998 third quarter, NII increased 8% for the quarter and 5%for the first nine months when compared with the 1998 periods. For purposes ofinternal analysis, management combines trading-related NII with trading revenue.Therefore, trading-related NII is excluded from the following analysis. -21-  22The following table provides a reconciliation between reported NII as presentedon the Consolidated Statement of Income and operating NII.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Disclosed on a taxable equivalent basis.bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Operating NII of $2.29 billion in the 1999 third quarter and $6.88 billion inthe 1999 nine months increased 2% from both the 1998 comparable periods. Theincreases were primarily due to higher average managed interest-earning assets,particularly domestic consumer loans (notably auto financings), and domesticcommercial loans. These increases were partially offset by a decline in theaverage foreign commercial loan portfolio, as Chase reduced its exposure toemerging markets over the past twelve months.The net yield on a managed basis was 3.58% for the 1999 third quarter, stablewith the 1998 third quarter. For the nine months of 1999, it was 3.59%, a fivebasis point decline from the net yield for the nine months of 1998. A slightimprovement in commercial loan spreads was offset by a decline in interest- freebalances. As a result of decreases in both the volume and rate earned oninterest-free funds, interest-free funds contributed 59 basis points to the netyield in the 1999 third quarter, compared to 83 basis points in the 1998 thirdquarter, and contributed 61 basis points to the net yield in the nine months of1999, compared to 83 basis points in the nine months of 1998.TRUST, CUSTODY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEESTrust, custody and investment management fees continued their strong performancein the 1999 third quarter and nine months by increasing 15% and 18% over thesame periods in 1998. These favorable results were largely attributable toportfolio acquisitions of custody and corporate trust businesses in late 1998and internally generated growth in investor services and structured financeactivities.CREDIT CARD REVENUEThe following table provides a reconciliation between reported and operatingcredit card revenue. Operating credit card revenue excludes the impact of creditcard securitizations.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------================================================================================ -22-  23Reported credit card revenue rose $60 million, or 16%, in the 1999 third quarterand for the 1999 nine months, revenue increased $212 million, or 20%. Theseincreases were the result of higher late charges and increased credit cardcustomer purchase volume.FEES FOR OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Insurance amounts exclude certain insurance fees related to credit cards and mortgage products, which are included in those revenue captions.================================================================================SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS increased 13% for the third quarter 1999, due tohigher fees charged on overdrafts. FEES IN LIEU OF COMPENSATING BALANCESincreased 25% for the third quarter 1999, due to an increase in the feestructure and customer volume. MORTGAGE SERVICING FEES increased by 123% and 60%for the third quarter and nine months of 1999, respectively, due to a largerservicing balance. The servicing portfolio increased 58% from prior year levelsdue to higher origination volume and an acquisition of mortgage servicingrights. BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES rose $8 million in the third quarterand $34 million in the nine months, due to a significant increase in customeractivity through Brown & Company, Chase's discount brokerage firm. In the pastyear, Brown & Company has tripled its average trades per day to approximately35,000, two-thirds of which are now on-line. HIGHER INSURANCE FEES in both the1999 third quarter and nine months reflected increased business volume, a directresult of increased marketing. LOAN COMMITMENT FEES increased 42% for the thirdquarter of 1999, due to increased volume in investment banking activity. OTHERFEES rose in both the third quarter and for the nine months of 1999 due to ATMfees charged to non-Chase customers, new cash management products and higherbusiness volume across a number of products.OTHER REVENUE================================================================================================================================================================Operating other revenue increased 18% for the third quarter of 1999 (over thesame period in 1998), due to improved results from the Octagon Credit InvestmentFund and a gain on the sale of upstate New York branches. Partially offsettingthese increases were lower revenue from residential mortgage activities (whichincludes origination and sale of loans and selective disposition of mortgageservicing rights) as a result of higher interest rates during the quarter and again in the 1998 third quarter from the sale of a foreign operation.The 1999 nine months included gains from the sales of student loans, higherrevenue from residential mortgage activities, a reflection of the favorableinterest-rate environment in early 1999, as well as improved results from theOctagon Credit Investment Fund, which was established late in the 1998 firstquarter.The 1999 nine month reported results included two special gains: $95 millionfrom the sale of One New York Plaza and $71 million from the sale of branches inBeaumont, Texas. -23-  24NONINTEREST EXPENSEOperating noninterest expense increased 14% and 12% for the third quarter andfirst nine months of 1999. Both increases were driven primarily by incentivecosts tied to higher market sensitive revenues and ongoing technology-relatedinvestments. Chase continues to manage its operating noninterest expense tosupport its revenue growth.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Represents a $100 million special contribution to The Chase Manhattan Foundation in the 1999 second quarter.(b) Included within Other Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. On an operating basis, these expenses are reflected in Credit Costs.(c) Excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed property expense, costs associated with the REIT and special items.(d) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.================================================================================The increase in salaries and employee benefits for the 1999 third quarter andnine months was due to higher incentive costs, mainly driven by highermarket-sensitive revenue. Also contributing to the increase was the net additionof almost 1,700 full-time equivalent employees as a result of acquisitions (inthe mortgage, credit card, and custody and fiduciary services businesses) andgrowth in certain businesses.================================================================================================================================================================OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSEOccupancy expense increased $20 million in the 1999 third quarter and $64million during the first nine months of 1999 when compared with same periods in1998. The increases were primarily due to higher rental costs resulting frombusiness expansions and acquisitions occurring in late 1998 and during 1999. Thehigher level of equipment expense during the 1999 third quarter and nine monthswas due to the increase in depreciation expense from the capitalization of costsrelated to more advanced hardware systems across all businesses. The increasewas also related to higher rental costs for Year 2000 compliant computerequipment. For a further discussion of Year 2000 efforts, see Operating RiskManagement section on page 34. -24-  25OTHER EXPENSE================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Includes REIT minority interest expense of $11 million in each quarter.(b) Represents a $100 million special contribution to The Chase Manhattan Foundation.================================================================================OPERATING OTHER EXPENSE for the 1999 third quarter and nine months increased $39million and $181 million, respectively, when compared with the third quarter andnine months of 1998. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COSTS for the first nine monthsreflect a higher level of contract computer professionals associated with theYear 2000 efforts. The increase in MARKETING EXPENSE was due to higher costs atChase Cardmember Services. Additionally, costs incurred for the Chase brandcampaign and sponsorship of various events also increased marketing expenses.The rise in TELECOMMUNICATIONS COSTS primarily reflects both installation andusage stemming from the growth in business volume at all of Chase's majorfranchises. The purchase of a global custody business during the fourth quarter1998 contributed to the increase in the AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES. For the1999 third quarter and first nine months, ALL OTHER EXPENSE increased $20million and $60 million, respectively, when compared to the same periods of1998, reflecting growth in business volume at Chase Cardmember Services andthe global custody acquisition.RESTRUCTURING COSTSFor a discussion of Chase's restructuring costs, see Note Four on page 8 of thisForm 10-Q.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs include provision for loan losses, credit costs associated withcredit card securitizations and foreclosed property expense.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Included in Other Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(b) Excludes provision for risk management instrument credit losses of $183 million in the third quarter of 1998 and $205 million for the nine months of 1998, which are netted against trading revenue. Prior periods have been restated.================================================================================Credit costs in 1999 increased from the respective 1998 levels, primarily due tohigher credit losses and lower recoveries in the domestic commercial loanportfolio.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $625 million in the third quarter of 1999compared with $462 million in the third quarter of 1998. The effective tax ratefor each period was 34.5% and 35.6%, respectively. For the nine months, Chaserecorded income tax expense of $2.04 billion in 1999, compared with $1.52billion in 1998, at an effective tax rate of 35.2% and 36.5%, respectively. -25-  26- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments in 1999 and should be read in conjunction with pages 29-35 and50-51 of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.================================================================================================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Represents the portion of Chase's credit card receivables that have beensecuritized. (b) Excludes charge-offs for risk management instruments, which arenetted against trading revenues. -26-  27Chase's managed credit related assets totaled $223 billion at September 30,1999, a slight decrease of $1 billion or 1% during the nine months of 1999reflecting lower derivatives and foreign exchange receivables and foreigncommercial loans. Chase's nonperforming assets at September 30, 1999 increased$409 million, or 25%, from the 1998 year-end level. This increase occurredprimarily in the foreign commercial loan portfolio, due to one customer.RETAINED NET CHARGE-OFFS increased $48 million during the 1999 third quarter and$156 million for the nine months of 1999, when compared to the same periods in1998. MANAGED NET CHARGE-OFFS decreased in the 1999 third quarter by $12 millionand increased by $45 million for the first nine months of 1999, as compared to1998. The increase in retained net charge-offs was due primarily to highercharge-off levels in the retained credit card portfolio and lower recoveries onthe domestic commercial portfolio. On a managed basis, these increases wereoffset by lower charge-offs on securitized credit cards.Management expects that credit costs, on a managed basis, will remain relativelystable over the remainder of 1999 and for the full year 1999 will be of asimilar magnitude to credit costs incurred in 1998. For the consumer portfolio,management expects net charge-off rates will be slightly lower than in 1998. Thecommercial charge-off rate varies more than the consumer charge-off rate and,over time, Chase expects annual commercial net charge-offs to be in the range of40-60 basis points.AVERAGE ANNUAL NET CHARGE-OFF RATES================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Includes domestic and foreign credit card activity.(b) Includes foreign loans.================================================================================CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans outstanding remainedstable at September 30, 1999, when compared with year-end balances, while thelevel of nonperforming domestic residential mortgage loans decreased by 2%. Theloss rate of .08% for the 1999 third quarter was up slightly from the previousyear. However, for the nine months of 1999, net charge-offs decreased by $3million when compared to the same period in 1998. This portfolio's asset qualitycontinues to be strong.Credit Card Loans: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managed basis,which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well as creditcard receivables that have been securitized.Average managed credit card receivables increased slightly for the three andnine month periods ended September 30, 1999, compared with the same periods lastyear. The decrease in the net charge-off rate for the third quarter of 1999 andthe first nine months was a result of lower customer bankruptcy levels.Management has been targeting net charge-offs, as a percentage of average creditcard receivables, to range from 5 1/2 - 6% for the 1999 full year andanticipates continuing improvement in credit quality in the credit cardportfolio into next year.MANAGED CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO (a)================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Includes domestic and foreign credit card activity.================================================================================ -27-  28Auto Financings: Auto financings increased 12%, reflecting continued strongcustomer demand due to favorable pricing programs. The charge-off rates of .41%for the third quarter and .42% for the nine months of 1999 are indicative of theselective approach to asset origination.Other Consumer: Other domestic consumer loans decreased 22% from the year-endlevel due to the sale of student loans during the first half of 1999. Theincrease in the net charge-off rates in 1999 reflects the sale ofgovernment-guaranteed student loans and higher losses in certain new andexisting product lines.COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIOThe DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL portfolio increased $1.7 billion from the 1998 year-end.Net charge-offs were $66 million during the 1999 third quarter and $132 millionfor the nine months of 1999, compared with net recoveries in the same prior yearperiods. Net charge-offs for the portfolio remain at a low level, indicativeof the portfolio's diversification and strong credit quality.The FOREIGN COMMERCIAL portfolio totaled $33.9 billion at September 30, 1999 andoutstandings declined slightly from 1998 year-end levels as Chase continued toreduce its exposure to emerging markets. Nonperforming assets increased $275million due primarily to a single foreign credit. Net charge-off levels for the1999 third quarter and nine months decreased in comparison with the prior yearby $118 million, or 77%, and $183 million, or 56%, respectively, due to theadverse market conditions in the third quarter of 1998.COUNTRY EXPOSUREThe following table presents Chase's country exposure to Asia and Latin America.Country exposure is based on the Federal Financial Institutions ExaminationCouncil ("FFIEC") guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk.For a further discussion of Chase's country exposure, see pages 33-34 of Chase's1998 Annual Report.SELECTED COUNTRY EXPOSURE (a)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Country exposure is based on FFIEC guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. Under FFIEC guidelines, resale agreements are reported by the country of the issuer of the underlying security. Chase, however, does not consider the cross-border risk of resale agreements to depend upon the country of the issuer of the underlying security and, as a result, has presented these amounts separately in the above table.(b) Includes loans and accrued interest, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit and undrawn commitments to extend credit.(c) Includes cross-border trading debt and equity instruments and the mark-to-market exposure of foreign exchange and derivative contracts. The amounts associated with foreign exchange and derivative contracts are presented after taking into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.(d) Excludes Bermuda and Cayman Islands. -28-  29At September 30, 1999, Chase had approximately $44 million in lending andtrading related exposure to Russia, a decrease of $52 million from December 31,1998. Chase also had at September 30, 1999 approximately $33 million in resaleagreements with non-Russian counterparties collateralized by non-rubledenominated Russian debt, a decrease of $54 million during 1999.Chase reduced its exposure to emerging markets in Asia and Latin America fromyear-end (by 20% and 4%, respectively). Total nonperforming assets in Asiaincreased by $292 million from 1998 year-end to $793 million at September 30,1999. Asian commercial loan net charge-offs for the 1999 third quarter and ninemonths were $22 million and $152 million, respectively, compared with $29million and $221 million, respectively, in the same 1998 periods. There were netrecoveries of $1 million and $3 million for Latin American commercial loansduring the third quarter and first nine months of 1999, respectively.Management believes that Chase's current levels of cross-border exposure reflectappropriate levels of business, market, credit and capital risk in light ofChase's cross-border business activities and, accordingly, management currentlydoes not expect there will be significant changes in Chase's cross-borderexposures over the balance of 1999 and into early next year.DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized inconnection with trading and ALM activities, see pages 34-35 and Notes One andNineteen of Chase's 1998 Annual Report. Counterparties in derivatives andforeign exchange are primarily investment grade financial institutions, most ofwhich are dealers in these products. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September30, 1999 and December 31, 1998.================================================================================================================================================================At September 30, 1999, nonperforming derivative contracts were $36 million,compared with $50 million at December 31, 1998. -29-  30ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with page 35 and NotesOne and Five of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) During the second quarter of 1999, Chase reclassified the Allowance for Credit Losses on Risk Management Instruments to be included as part of the valuation of its Trading Assets: Risk Management Instruments.================================================================================Chase deems its allowances for credit losses at September 30, 1999 to beadequate. Estimating losses is inherently uncertain and depends on many factors,including general macroeconomic and political conditions, rating migration,structural changes within industries which alter competitive positions, eventrisk, unexpected correlations within the portfolio, and other external factorssuch as legal and regulatory requirements. Chase periodically reviews suchfactors and reassesses the adequacy of the allowances for credit losses. -30-  31- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion focuses primarily on developments during 1999 andshould be read in conjunction with pages 36-39 and Notes One and Nineteen ofChase's 1998 Annual Report.The table that follows provides information on Chase's value-at-risk on itstrading and asset/liability management ("ALM") portfolios.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------NM: Because the minimum and maximum VARs may occur on different days fordifferent risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfoliodiversification effect.Average aggregate VAR (VAR for both trading and ALM activities) for thetwelve-month period ended September 30, 1999 was $81.5 million and at September30, 1999 was $90.5 million. Chase's aggregate average and period-end VARs areless than the sum of the respective trading and ALM VARs shown in the abovetable (by $20.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively) due to risk offsets,resulting from portfolio diversification which occurs across the trading and ALMportfolios. The increase in the aggregate VAR levels through September 30, 1999were primarily due to the increase in interest rate volatility over the pasttwelve months, and the increase in net risk resulting from the Mellon MortgageServicing Portfolio acquisition.Chase conducts daily VAR backtesting for both regulatory compliance with theBasle Committee on Banking Supervision market risk capital rules and internalevaluation of VAR against trading revenues. For trading activities, there wereno days during the twelve months ended September 30, 1999 in which a dailytrading loss exceeded that day's VAR. This compares to an expected number ofapproximately 3 days under Chase's VAR model.The following chart contains a histogram of daily market risk-related revenue,which is defined as the daily change in value of mark-to-market tradingportfolios plus any trading-related net interest income or other revenue. Chaseposted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 244 out of 259 businesstrading days, with 61 business days exceeding positive $20 million. Chaseincurred no daily trading losses in excess of $20 million over the past twelvemonths. -31-  32 [Graphic of Daily Market Risk-Related Revenue - See Appendix I]ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTMEASURING INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY: Oversight of Chase's ALM interest rate riskand Market Risk Management functions was consolidated under the Market RiskCommittee at the beginning of 1999. At that time, Chase began to extend themarket risk procedures and measurements utilized for its trading and investmentportfolios to its ALM activities.In order to improve its management of interest rate exposure and as part of theconvergence of the ALM and market risk management processes, Chase implementedduring the first quarter of 1999 a new measure to estimate the potential changein value to Chase's ALM portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Thisnew measure is used in conjunction with existing earnings simulation measures.The new measure, which is called "Basis Point Value" (BPV), quantifies thechange in the economic value of Chase's ALM portfolio (non-trading on- andoff-balance sheet positions) that would result from a 1 basis point change ininterest rates. This same measure is also used to quantify the economic valuesensitivity of the ALM positions to basis risk.At September 30, 1999, Chase had a BPV value of $4.1 million (pre-tax),indicating that the economic value of Chase's ALM positions would decline $4.1million for every 1 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming all ratesmoved in parallel together. This compares with a BPV of $6.4 million at December31, 1998. The BPV measure is generally "symmetrical"; that is, a 1 basis pointdecrease in interest rates at September 30, 1999 would result in a $4.1 million(pre-tax) increase in economic value. The BPV measure includes exposure to U.S.dollar interest rates as well as exposure to non-U.S. dollar interest rates incurrency markets in which Chase does business. Since U.S. dollar interest ratesand non-U.S. dollar interest rates may not move in tandem, the reported BPVvalue may not represent the actual change in economic value of Chases' ALMportfolio.At September 30, 1999, based on Chase's simulation models and applying immediateincreases to various market interest rates (100 bp increase for USdollar-denominated positions and a range from 100 bp to 1500 bp increases fornon-US dollar-denominated positions), earnings at risk over the next twelvemonths are estimated to be approximately 3% of projected 1999 net income. During1998, Chase's earnings at risk to an immediate rise in interest rates averagedless than 4% of net income for 1998. The hypothetical rate shocks are used tocalculate risk that Chase believes to be reasonably possible of occurring in thenear term, but these scenarios do not necessarily represent management's currentview of future market interest rate developments. -32-  33Impact of ALM Derivative Activity:The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's ALM activities.================================================================================(a) These net unrecognized gains/(losses) do not include the netunfavorable/(favorable) impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by thesederivative contracts.================================================================================LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following liquidity and capital discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 40-41 and Note Eighteen ofChase's 1998 Annual Report.LIQUIDITYDuring the nine months of 1999, Chase issued $3.4 billion of long-term debt andcapital securities of subsidiaries, more than offsetting $2.1 billion oflong-term debt that matured and $0.5 billion that was redeemed.For a discussion of liquidity risk related to Year 2000, see the Operating RiskManagement section of this Form 10-Q on pages 35 and 36.CAPITALChase's capital levels at September 30, 1999 remained strong, with capitalratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. At September 30, 1999, the Tier1 and Total Capital ratios were 8.2% and 11.8%, respectively, and the Tier 1leverage ratio was 6.7%.During the nine months of 1999, Chase's balance sheet assets increased by only1% as a result of continued focus on SVA. Management believes a reasonablelong-term growth rate for balance sheet assets is approximately 6% - 7%.The following table shows the impact Chase's disciplined approach to balancesheet management has had on the growth in risk-weighted assets.================================================================================At September 30, 1999, the Tier 1 capital ratio was within management's intendedlong-term target range of 8% to 8.25%, notwithstanding net equity purchasesduring the third quarter of approximately $780 million and for the nine monthsof approximately $2.6 billion, and a slight increase in risk-weighted assets.Capital generated in excess of this target ratio will be used to purchase Chasecommon stock or for future reinvestment and acquisition opportunities. As aresult of the pending Hambrecht & Quist acquisition, management anticipates thatit will be reducing the pace of its stock repurchases for the remainder of theyear. -33-  34The following table shows the sources and uses of Chase's free cash flow forthe periods indicated.================================================================================================================================================================During the nine months of 1999, $2.3 billion of free cash flow was generated,more than that generated during the full year 1998 and more than double for thefull year 1997. During 1999, less capital was needed for internal growth (as wasthe case in 1997), or to bolster capital ratios (as was the case in 1998). Theexcess cash in 1999 was primarily used for stock repurchases.In the first quarter of 1999, Chase raised the cash dividend on its common stockto $.41 per share from $.36 per share. Chase has over the past several yearsbeen paying a common stock dividend that has generally been equal toapproximately 25% to 35% of Chase's operating net income, less preferred stockdividends. Chase's future dividend policies will be determined by its Board ofDirectors taking into consideration Chase's earnings and financial condition andapplicable governmental regulation and policies.Under its equity repurchase program, which became effective January 4, 1999,Chase may repurchase up to $3 billion of its common stock in the open market orthrough negotiated transactions, in addition to any amounts that may need to bepurchased to provide for issuances under Chase's dividend reinvestment plan andits various stock-based employee benefit plans. As of September 30, 1999, Chasehad repurchased approximately net $2.6 billion. Management anticipates that itwill be reducing the pace of its stock repurchases for the remainder of the yearto offset the capital impact of the acquisition of Hambrecht & Quist.At September 30, 1999, the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 andTier 2 capital) was $35.1 billion, an increase of $234 million from December 31,1998. This increase reflects retained earnings (net income less common andpreferred dividends) generated during the period and new issuance of capitalsecurities of subsidiaries qualifying as Tier 1 capital, partially offset bycommon stock repurchases, the redemption of $100 million of preferred stock anda net decline in debt issuances qualifying as Tier 2 capital.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's operating risk management focuses primarilyon developments since December 31, 1998.Chase, like all large financial institutions, is exposed to many types ofoperating risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders,unauthorized transactions by employees, and errors relating to computer andtelecommunications systems. Chase maintains systems of controls that it believesare reasonably designed to provide senior management and the Board of Directorswith timely and accurate information about the operations of Chase. Thesesystems have been designed to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in viewof Chase's financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses and themarkets in which it operates, and the competitive and regulatory environment towhich it is subject. However, Chase has suffered losses from operating risk fromtime to time as discussed below, and there can be no assurance that Chase willnot suffer such losses in the future. -34-  35Chase has identified some deficiencies in the computerized bond recordkeepingsystem in the bond paying agency function within Chase's Capital MarketsFiduciary Services group. These deficiencies include an overstatement by thecomputer system of the amount of outstanding bonds and matured unpresented bondsand other items. Because of these deficiencies, Chase is currently unable toconfirm through a complete reconciliation of the relevant accounts that thevalue of bonds that could potentially be presented for payment does not exceedthe amount of cash on hand for payment of such bonds. Chase has underway aproject to correct the system's deficiencies and to reconcile the affectedaccounts. In the third quarter of 1999, in the course of this project, certainpast operating errors in bond administration were discovered, which required awrite-off of an immaterial amount. While management considers it likely thatother write-offs will be taken in the remaining course of the project, it doesnot expect them to be material. The staff of the Securities and ExchangeCommission has initiated an inquiry relating to the question of whether, inconnection with this matter, there have been violations of its transfer agencyrecordkeeping or reporting regulations.YEAR 2000: Chase's Year 2000 efforts are discussed on pages 41-42 of Chase's1998 Annual Report, on pages 32-33 of Chase's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q forthe quarter ended March 31, 1999 ("First Quarter 10-Q") and on pages 33-34 ofChase's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1999("Second Quarter 10-Q"). The information below updates Chase's Year 2000disclosures.As of September 30, 1999, Chase's computer systems applications currentlyin operation have been remediated and tested for Year 2000 compliance. Chase'sinformation technology teams are now managing systems changes to ensure thatChase's computer systems applications remain Year 2000 compliant. Chase hasalso imposed a "freeze" on technology changes from October 1, 1999 through theend of January 2000. The freeze is intended to ensure that Chase's technologyenvironment will be highly stable at year-end.Due diligence efforts of external Year 2000 risks are continuing. This includesdue diligence on settlement counterparties, business partners (such ascorrespondents, sub custodians, and investment advisors), and customers. Inaddition, stress testing, on at least a monthly basis, of Chase'smarket-sensitive portfolios is being performed. The stress test scenarioscontinue to be updated as more information about worldwide Year 2000 readinessbecomes available. Chase continues to evaluate potential Year 2000 impacts uponits funding capability and has taken actions to incorporate such risks into itscapital and liquidity planning in order to meet anticipated funding needs atyear end.The results of Chase's due diligence and other assessment efforts are utilizedby Chase to help it manage its Year 2000 business risks. Under the auspices ofChase's Year 2000 Business Risk Council, contingency plans have been developed,refined and tested. Approximately 250 different risk scenarios have beenidentified across all geographies and Chase businesses, resulting in thedevelopment of approximately 1,400 individual Year 2000 contingency plans. Theseplans include identification of possible alternative methods by which to provideservice, alternative locations for operations, increased staff support toservice customers, as well as ways for Chase to maintain critical services inthe event of environmental infrastructure outages.Chase's Year 2000 program is now focused almost entirely on final preparationsfor the event. Year 2000 command centers have been created; problem tracking andreporting tools designed; key operational and service performance measuresidentified for tracking; "wellness checks" of facilities, services, and systemshave been planned; and training of "rapid response teams" is in process. Threedress rehearsals have been scheduled during the fourth quarter of 1999. Thefirst dress rehearsal, scheduled for October 15, 1999, tested command centerconnectivity and processes. The second dress rehearsal, scheduled for October 29and 30, 1999, tested Chase's Year 2000 tracking, monitoring and communicationsprocesses. These dress rehearsals were successful in identifying areas forimproved communication and more efficient decision making at the event. Thethird dress rehearsal, scheduled for early December 1999, is intended to refinebusiness status reporting and test back-up command center infrastructure andprocesses. The Year 2000 command center structure will become operational inlate December and will continue in place until a stable operating environment isachieved.Chase continues to estimate that full year 1999 Year 2000 costs will beapproximately $158 million. -35-  36- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-4 of Chase's 1998 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $3.5 billion atSeptember 30, 1999.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------DERIVATIVESIn September 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, which establishes accounting andreporting standards for all derivative instruments, including certain derivativeinstruments embedded in other financial instruments (collectively referred to asderivatives), and for hedging activities. During the second quarter of 1999, theFASB issued SFAS 137, which delayed the effective date of SFAS 133 for one year,with early adoption permitted. Chase will, therefore, not be required to adoptSFAS 133 until calendar year 2001. For a further discussion of the requirementsof SFAS 133, see the Accounting and Reporting Developments section on page 43 ofthe 1998 Annual Report.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER EVENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------On September 28, 1999, Chase and Hambrecht & Quist Group announced an agreementunder which Chase would acquire Hambrecht & Quist for $50 per share in cash ora total consideration of $1.35 billion. The boards of directors of bothcompanies have approved the agreement and Chase expects the acquisition to becompleted by the end of the year. Revenues and expenses associated with theacquisition of Hambrecht & Quist will be integrated into Chase's Global Bankline of business. -36-  37 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA AND RATIOS)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Based on annualized amounts.(b) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs andspecial items.

Legal Proceedings The following discussion of certain legal proceedings focuses primarily on developments since December 31, 1998 and updates the discussion entitled "Legal Proceedings" appearing on page 6 of Chase's 1998 Annual Report. As previously reported in the 1998 Annual Report, in 50-Off Stores, Inc. v. Banque Paribas (Suisse) S.A., a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas alleging conversion of shares of common stock held in a custody account of The Chase Manhattan Bank, judgment was entered against the Bank for $148.6 million in punitive and compensatory damages, plus post-judgment interest. On appeal by Chase, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the punitive damage award of $138 million, resulting in a remaining award of $10.6 million in compensatory damages. Both the plaintiff and Chase filed petitions for rehearing with the Fifth Circuit which petitions were denied. Plaintiff has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 1999, Sumitomo Corporation filed a lawsuit against The Chase Manhattan Bank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that during the period from 1994 to 1996, the Bank assisted a Sumitomo employee in making copper trades by funding unauthorized loans to the Sumitomo employee. The complaint alleges that the Bank knew the employee did not have authority to enter into the transactions on behalf of Sumitomo. The complaint asserts claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Practices Act ("RICO") and New York common law and alleges damages of $532 million (subject to trebling under RICO), plus punitive damages. Chase Securities Inc. ("CSI") has been named as a defendant in three of seven actions that were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma in October 1999 arising out of the failure of Commercial Financial Service, Inc. ("CFS"). Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchased over $1.6 billion in original face amount of asset-backed securities issued by CFS. The securities were backed by delinquent credit card receivables. In addition to CSI, the defendants in various of the actions are the founders and key executives of CFS, as well as its auditors, its outside counsel and the rating agencies that rated the securities. CSI is alleged to have been the investment banker to CFS and to have acted as an initial purchaser and as placement agent in connection with the issuance of certain of the securities. Plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or were reckless in not knowing that the securities were sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleading misrepresentations and omissions of material facts. The complaints against CSI assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Oklahoma Securities Act, and under common law theories of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. In the actions against CSI, plaintiffs seek approximately $500 million in damages allegedly suffered as a result of defendants' misrepresentations and omissions. A date for CSI to answer or move with respect to the complaints has not yet been set. In addition to the matters described above, Chase and its subsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various legal actions and proceedings arising in connection with their respective businesses and have been involved from time to time in investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, Chase cannot state what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be. Chase is contesting the allegations made in each pending matter and believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Chase, but may be material to Chase's operating results for any particular period, depending on the level of Chase's income for such period. -42-  43Item 2.
