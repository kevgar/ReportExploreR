Upon consummation of the merger,Chemical Banking Corporation changed its name to "The Chase ManhattanCorporation". (See Note One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements onpage 67 for a more complete description of the merger). The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, theinformation presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K presents the combinedresults of Chase and Chemical as if the merger had been in effect for allperiods presented.================================================================================OverviewThe Chase Manhattan Corporation (the "Corporation") is a bank holding companyorganized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1968 and registered underthe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). The Corporation conducts domestic and international financial servicesbusinesses through various bank and non-bank subsidiaries. At December 31, 1996,the principal bank subsidiaries of the Corporation were: The Chase ManhattanBank ("Chase Bank"), a New York banking corporation headquartered in New YorkCity, Texas Commerce Bank National Association ("Texas Commerce"), a nationalbank headquartered in Texas, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, National Association("Chase USA"), a national bank headquartered in Delaware. The principal non-banksubsidiary of the Corporation is Chase Securities Inc. ("CSI"), theCorporation's "Section 20" subsidiary, which is engaged in securitiesunderwriting and dealing activities. At December 31, 1996, the Corporation wasthe largest bank holding company in the United States in terms of total assetsand Chase Bank was the largest bank in the United States in terms of totalassets. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of the Corporation operate nationally aswell as through overseas branches and an international network of representativeoffices, subsidiaries and affiliated banks. The financial services provided by the Corporation's domestic subsidiariesinclude personal and commercial checking accounts, savings and time depositaccounts, personal and business loans, consumer financing, leasing, real estatefinancing, investment banking, mortgage banking, money transfer, cashmanagement, safe deposit facilities, personal trust and estate administration,corporate and institutional trust and securities processing services, fullinvestment services, discount brokerage, insurance, United States Government and Federal agency securities dealership, corporate debt and equity securities dealership and underwriting, and United States corporate tax depository facilities. Internationally, services also include correspondent banking arrangements,merchant banking, and underwriting and trading of Eurosecurities. The Corporation also provides products to ensure that a customer will have aspecific currency-exchange or interest rate at some future date. These productsinclude interest rate and currency swaps, interest rate options, forward rateagreements, forward interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts andfinancial futures. The Corporation retains a 20% interest in The CIT Group Holdings, Inc.("CIT"). CIT, directly or through its subsidiaries, engages in diversifiedfinancial services activities, primarily in the United States. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to thecurrent presentation.================================================================================Lines-of-BusinessThe Corporation's activities are internally organized, for management reportingpurposes, into two major business franchises (Global Wholesale Banking andRegional and Nationwide Consumer Banking). A description of the Corporation'sbusiness franchises are discussed in the section of Management's Discussion andAnalysis entitled "Lines of Business Results" beginning on page 43.================================================================================CompetitionThe Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in a highlycompetitive environment. The Corporation's bank subsidiaries compete with otherdomestic and foreign banks, thrift institutions, credit unions, and money marketand other mutual funds for deposits and other sources of funds. In addition, theCorporation and its bank and non-bank subsidiaries face increased competitionwith respect to the diverse financial services and products they offer.Competitors include finance companies, brokerage firms, investment bankingcompanies, merchant banks, insurance companies, leasing companies, and a varietyof other financial services and advisory companies. Many of these competitorsare not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as are domestic bank holdingcompanies and banks, such as the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries.================================================================================Government Monetary Policies and Economic ControlsThe earnings and business of the Corporation are affected by general economicconditions, both domestic and international. In addition, fiscal or otherpolicies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the UnitedStates, by foreign governments, and by international agencies can have importantconsequences on the financial performance of the Corporation. The Corporation isparticularly affected by the policies of the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), which regulates the nationalsupply of bank credit. An important purpose of these policies is to curbinflation and moderate recessions through the control of the supply of money andcredit. The Federal Reserve Board uses its powers to establish reserverequirements of insured depository institutions and to conduct open marketoperations in United States government securities so as to influence the supplyof money and credit. These policies have a direct effect on the amounts of bankloans and deposits and on interest rates charged 1  4on loans and paid on deposits, with the result that Federal Reserve Boardpolicies can have a material effect on bank earnings. The Corporation has economic, credit, legal, and other specialists whomonitor economic conditions, and domestic and foreign government policies andactions. However, since it is difficult to predict changes in macroeconomicconditions and in governmental policies and actions relating thereto, it isdifficult to foresee the effects of any such changes on the business andearnings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.================================================================================Supervision and RegulationGeneral: The Corporation is subject to regulation as a registered bank holdingcompany under the BHCA. As such, the Corporation is required to file with theFederal Reserve Board an annual report and other information required quarterlypursuant to the BHCA. The Corporation is also subject to the examination powersof the Federal Reserve Board. Under the BHCA, the Corporation may not engage in any business other thanmanaging and controlling banks or furnishing certain specified services tosubsidiaries, and may not acquire voting control of non-banking corporations,except those corporations engaged in businesses or furnishing services which theFederal Reserve Board deems to be so closely related to banking as "to be aproper incident thereto". Further, the Corporation is prohibited, with certainexceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than5% of the voting shares of any corporation that is engaged in activities thatare not closely related to banking, and may not acquire direct or indirectownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any domestic bankwithout the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.Dividend Restrictions: Federal law imposes limitations on the payment ofdividends by the subsidiaries of the Corporation that are state member banks ofthe Federal Reserve System (a "state member bank") or national banks. Non-banksubsidiaries of the Corporation are not subject to such limitations. The amountof dividends that may be paid by a state member bank, such as Chase Bank, or bya national bank, such as Chase USA or Texas Commerce, is limited to the lesserof the amounts calculated under a "recent earnings" test and an "undividedprofits" test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if thetotal of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess ofthe current-year's net income combined with the retained net income of the twopreceding years unless the bank obtains the approval of its appropriate Federalbanking regulator (which, in the case of a state member bank, is the FederalReserve Board and, in the case of a national bank, is the Office of theComptroller of the Currency (the "Comptroller of the Currency")). Under theundivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank's"undivided profits". In accordance with the foregoing restrictions, the Corporation's banksubsidiaries could, during 1997, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay aggregate dividends of approximately $1.5 billion to theirrespective bank holding companies, plus an additional aggregate amount equal totheir net income from January 1, 1997 through the date in 1997 of any suchdividend payment. In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the Federal ReserveBoard, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation ("FDIC") have authority under the Financial Institutions SupervisoryAct to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the bankingorganizations they supervise, including the Corporation and its subsidiariesthat are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator'sopinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice inlight of the financial condition of the banking organization.Capital Requirements: The Federal banking regulators have also adoptedrisk-based capital and leverage guidelines, which require that the Corporation'scapital-to-assets ratios meet certain minimum standards. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by allocating assets and specifiedoff-balance sheet financial instruments into four weighted categories, withhigher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived asrepresenting greater risk. Under the guidelines, a banking corporation's capitalis divided into two tiers. Tier 1 Capital includes common equity, qualifyingperpetual preferred stock, minority interests in the equity accounts ofconsolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other non-qualifying intangiblesand other assets. Tier 2 Capital includes, among other items, perpetualpreferred equity not qualifying for Tier 1, limited-life preferred stock with anoriginal maturity of greater than 20 years, mandatory convertible debt,subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock with an originalweighted-average maturity of at least five years, and qualifying allowance forcredit losses, less required deductions as provided by regulation. The amount ofTier 2 Capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is thesum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital. Banking organizations are required to maintain a Total risk-based capitalratio (Total Capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8%, of which at least 4% mustbe Tier 1 Capital. The Federal banking regulators have also established minimum leverage ratioguidelines. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 Capital divided by averagetotal assets (net of allowance for credit losses, goodwill and certainintangible assets). The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for banking organizationsthat have well-diversified risk (including no undue interest rate risk);excellent asset quality; high liquidity; good earnings; and, in general, areconsidered strong banking organizations. Other banking organizations areexpected to have ratios of at least 4%-5% depending upon their particularcondition and growth plans. Higher capital ratios could be required if warrantedby the particular circumstance or risk profile of a given banking organization. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")required each Federal banking regulator to revise its risk-based capitalstandards within 18 months of enactment of the statute to ensure that thosestandards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of creditrisk and the risk of non-traditional activities, as well as reflect the actualperformance and expected risk of loss on multi-family mortgages. On December 15,1994, the Federal banking regulators adopted amendments to their respectiverisk-based capital requirements that explicitly identify concentration of creditrisk and certain risks 2  5arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, asimportant factors to consider in assessing an institution's overall capitaladequacy. The amendments do not, however, mandate any specific adjustments tothe risk-based capital calculations as a result of such factors. In May 1996, the Federal banking agencies announced that they were going torefrain from imposing a separate, explicit capital charge for interest raterisk, although they might do so in the future. In August 1996, the Federalbanking agencies adopted amendments to their risk-based capital rules toincorporate a measure for market risk in foreign exchange and commodityactivities and in the trading of debt and equity instruments. These amendments,which become effective at year-end 1997, will require banking organizations withrelatively large trading activities, such as the Corporation, to maintaincapital for market risk in an amount that may be calculated by using the bankingorganizations' own internal value-at-risk models (subject to parameters set bythe regulators). The effect of these amendments is that, in addition to existingcapital requirements for credit risk, the Corporation will be required tomaintain additional capital for market risk. This additional requirement may besatisfied, in part, by issuing short-term subordinated debt that qualifies as"Tier 3 Capital". The Corporation does not anticipate that these amendments tothe risk-based capital rules will have a material effect on its operations.FDICIA: FDICIA also required the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessmentsystem for FDIC deposit insurance and revised certain provisions of the FederalDeposit Insurance Act, as well as certain other Federal banking statutes. Ingeneral, FDICIA provides for expanded regulation of depository institutions andtheir affiliates, including parent holding companies, by such institutions'Federal banking regulators, and requires the Federal banking regulator to take"prompt corrective action" with respect to a depository institution if suchinstitution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards.Prompt Corrective Action: Pursuant to FDICIA, the Federal Reserve Board, theFDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted regulations setting forth afive-tier scheme for measuring the capital adequacy of the depositoryinstitutions they supervise. Under the regulations (commonly referred to as the"prompt corrective action" rules), an institution would be placed in one of thefollowing capital categories: (i) well capitalized (an institution that has aTotal risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capitalratio of at least 6% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%); (ii)adequately capitalized (an institution that has a Total risk-based capital ratioof at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a Tier 1leverage ratio of at least 4%); (iii) undercapitalized (an institution that hasa Total risk-based capital ratio of under 8% or a Tier 1 risk-based capitalratio under 4% or a Tier 1 leverage ratio under 4%); (iv) significantlyundercapitalized (an institution that has a Total risk-based capital ratio ofunder 6% or a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio under 3% or a Tier 1 leverageratio under 3%), and (v) critically undercapitalized (an institution that has aratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less). Supervisory actions by the appropriate Federal banking regulator will dependupon an institution's classification within the five categories. Allinstitutions are generally prohibited from declaring any dividends, making anyother capital distribution, or paying a management fee to any controllingperson, if such payment would cause the institution to become undercapitalized.Additional supervisory actions are mandated for an institution falling into oneof the three "undercapitalized" categories, with the severity of supervisoryaction increasing at greater levels of capital deficiency. For example,critically undercapitalized institutions are, among other things, restrictedfrom making any principal or interest payments on subordinated debt withoutprior approval of their Federal banking regulator. The regulations apply only tobanks and not to bank holding companies, such as the Corporation; however, theFederal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holdingcompany level based on the undercapitalized status of such holding company'ssubsidiary banking institution. In certain instances relating to anundercapitalized banking institution, the bank holding company would be requiredto guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary and may beliable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on suchguarantee. As of the date hereof, each of the Corporation's banking subsidiaries were"well capitalized".Brokered Deposits: The ability of depository institutions to accept brokereddeposits is regulated under FDICIA. The term "brokered deposits" is defined toinclude deposits that are solicited by a bank's affiliates on its behalf. Asignificant portion of Chase Bank's and Chase USA's wholesale deposits aresolicited on their behalf by broker-dealer affiliates and are consideredbrokered deposits. Under the rule, (i) an "undercapitalized" institution isprohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits, (ii) an"adequately capitalized" institution must obtain a waiver from the FDIC beforeaccepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits and is not permitted topay interest on brokered deposits accepted in such institution's normal marketarea at rates that "significantly exceed" rates paid on deposits of similarmaturity in such area, and (iii) a "well capitalized" institution may accept,renew or roll over brokered deposits without restriction. The definitions of"well capitalized", "adequately capitalized", and "undercapitalized" are thesame as those utilized in the "prompt corrective action" rules described above.FDIC Insurance Assessments: Under the FDIC's risk-based insurance premiumassessment system, each depository institution is assigned to one of nine riskclassifications based upon certain capital and supervisory measures and,depending upon its classification, is assessed insurance premiums on itsdeposits. Depository institutions insured by the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF")which are ranked in the top risk classification category were required to payonly the statutory minimum of $2,000 annually for deposit insurance during 1996,while all other banks were required to pay premiums ranging from 3 basis pointsto 27 basis points of domestic deposits. Each of the Corporation's banks,including Chase Bank, Chase USA and Texas Commerce, paid the statutory minimumpremium in 1996. As a result of the enactment on September 30, 1996 of theEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (the "DepositFunds Act"), the statutory minimum annual assessment of $2,000 was eliminatedfor top-ranked depository institutions. However, the Deposit Funds Act imposedan annual assessment on all depository institutions in order to pay interest onbonds issued by the Financing 3  6Corporation ("FICO") in connection with the resolution of savings associationinsolvencies occurring prior to 1991. The FICO assessment will be 1.3 basispoints of domestic deposits in the case of BIF-insured institutions such asChase Bank, Chase USA and Texas Commerce. These rate schedules are subject tofuture adjustments by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC has authority to imposespecial assessments from time to time, subject to certain limitations specifiedin the Deposit Funds Act.Powers of the FDIC Upon Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution: TheFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA")imposes liability on an FDIC-insured depository institution (such as theCorporation's bank subsidiaries) for costs incurred by the FDIC in connectionwith the insolvency of other FDIC-insured institutions under common control withsuch institution (commonly referred to as "cross-guarantees" of insureddepository institutions). An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a depositoryinstitution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company andits affiliates against such depository institution. In the event an insured depository institution becomes insolvent, or upon theoccurrence of certain other events specified in the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct, whenever the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of such insureddepository institution, the FDIC has the power: (i) to transfer any of suchbank's assets and liabilities to a new obligor (including, but not limited to,another financial institution acquiring all or a portion of the bank's business,assets or liabilities), without the approval of such bank's creditors; (ii) toenforce the terms of such bank's contracts pursuant to their terms, or (iii) torepudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which such depositoryinstitution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to beburdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by theFDIC to promote the orderly administration of such depository institution. Suchprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act would be applicable toobligations and liabilities of those of the Corporation's subsidiaries that areinsured depository institutions, such as Chase Bank, Chase USA and TexasCommerce, including without limitation, obligations under senior or subordinateddebt issued by such banks to investors (hereinafter referred to as "publicnoteholders") in the public markets. In its resolution of the problems of an insured depository institution indefault or in danger of default, the FDIC is not permitted to take any actionthat would have the effect of increasing the losses to a deposit insurance fundby protecting depositors for more than the insured portion of their deposits orby protecting creditors of the insured depository institution (including publicnoteholders), other than depositors. In addition, the FDIC is authorized tosettle all uninsured and unsecured claims in the insolvency of an insuredinstitution by making a final settlement payment after the declaration ofinsolvency based upon a percentage determined by the FDIC reflecting an averageof the FDIC's receivership recovery experience, regardless of the assets of theinsolvent institution actually available for distribution to creditors. Such apayment would constitute full payment and disposition of the FDIC's obligationsto claimants. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included a "depositorpreference" provision, which provided that the claims of a receiver of aninsured depository institution for administrative expenses and the claims ofholders of deposit liabilities (including the FDIC, as subrogee of such holders)have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of such institution,including public noteholders, in the event of the liquidation or otherresolution of such institution. As a result of the provisions described above, whether or not the FDIC eversought to repudiate any obligations held by public noteholders of any subsidiaryof the Corporation that is an insured depository institution, such as ChaseBank, Chase USA or Texas Commerce, the public noteholders would be treateddifferently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than,holders of deposit obligations of such depository institution.Other Supervision and Regulation: Under Federal Reserve Board policy, theCorporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each banksubsidiary and to commit resources to support such bank subsidiary incircumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Any loans by a bankholding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right ofpayment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary banks.In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bankholding company to a Federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of asubsidiary bank at a certain level will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee andentitled to a priority of payment. The bank subsidiaries of the Corporation are subject to certain restrictionsimposed by Federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain othertransactions with, the Corporation and certain other affiliates and oninvestments in stock or securities thereof. Such restrictions prevent theCorporation and other affiliates from borrowing from a bank subsidiary unlessthe loans are secured in specified amounts. Without the prior approval of theFederal Reserve Board, secured loans, other transactions and investments by anybank subsidiary are generally limited in amount as to the Corporation and as toeach of the other affiliates to 10% of the bank's capital and surplus and as tothe Corporation and all such other affiliates to an aggregate of 20% of thebank's capital and surplus. Federal law also requires that transactions betweena bank subsidiary and the Corporation or certain non-bank affiliates, includingextensions of credit, sales of securities or assets and the provision ofservices, be conducted on terms at least as favorable to the bank subsidiary asthose that apply or that would apply to comparable transactions withunaffiliated parties. The Corporation's bank and non-bank subsidiaries are subject to directsupervision and regulation by various other Federal and state authorities. ChaseBank, as a New York State-chartered bank and member bank of the Federal ReserveSystem, is subject to supervision and regulation of the New York State BankingDepartment as well as by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. TheCorporation's national bank subsidiaries, such as Chase USA and Texas Commerce,are subject to substantially similar supervision and regulation by theComptroller of the Currency. Supervision and regulation by each of the foregoingregulatory agencies generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all majoraspects of the relevant bank's business and condition, as well 4  7as the imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations oninvestments and other powers. The operations of The Vista Funds, theCorporation's mutual funds, including the means by which they may be distributedin the United States, are subject to regulation by the Securities and ExchangeCommission ("SEC") and the Federal Reserve Board. The types of activities inwhich the foreign branches of Chase Bank and the international subsidiaries ofthe Corporation may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by theFederal Reserve Board. Such foreign branches and international subsidiaries arealso subject to the laws and banking authorities of the countries in which theyoperate. The Corporation also conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerageactivities through various broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subjectto the regulations of the SEC and the National Association of SecuritiesDealers, Inc. CSI, the Corporation's "Section 20" subsidiary, is also subject tothe supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal ReserveBoard has generally required Section 20 subsidiaries to operate under a largenumber of conditions, commonly referred to as "firewalls", that separate Section20 companies from affiliated banks and, to a certain degree, from other bankholding company affiliates. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board required thatno more than 10% of a Section 20 subsidiary's gross revenues be derived fromunderwriting and dealing in "ineligible" securities (i.e., securities in which anational bank may not underwrite or deal). On December 20, 1996, the FederalReserve Board increased, effective March 6, 1997, the ineligible revenue limitto 25% of total revenues. The effect of this regulatory action will be to enablethe Corporation to substantially expand CSI's underwriting and dealingcapabilities. On January 9, 1997, the Federal Reserve Board proposed eliminatingmost of the firewalls and incorporating the remaining firewalls in a statementof operating standards. The proposal, if adopted, would enable CSI to operatesomewhat more efficiently. The activities of Chase Bank, Chase USA and Texas Commerce as consumerlenders are also subject to regulation under various Federal laws including theTruth-in-Lending, the Equal Credit Opportunity, the Fair Credit Reporting, theFair Debt Collection Practice and the Electronic Funds Transfer Acts, as well asvarious state laws. These statutes impose requirements on the making,enforcement and collection of consumer loans and on the types of disclosuresthat need to be made in connection with such loans. During 1996, the UnitedStates Supreme Court decided two cases involving the consumer lending activitiesof banks. In January 1996, the Court held that Federal law pre-empted state lawsprohibiting a credit card issuing bank located in one state from assessingvarious fees and charges (such as late fees, over-the-limit fees, returned checkfees and annual membership fees) on credit card holders residing in anotherstate. In March 1996, the Court held that the Federal statute authorizingnational banks to sell insurance in small towns pre-empts a state statuteforbidding national banks from selling insurance in that state. The effect ofthese decisions should be to enhance the Corporation's ability to conduct itsconsumer banking businesses.================================================================================Important Factors Relating to Forward-Looking Statements.Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within themeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statementsare subject to risks and uncertainties and the Corporation's actual futureresults may differ materially from those set forth in such forward-lookingstatements. The Corporation notes that the forward-looking statements containedin this report speak only as of the date of this report and the Corporationundertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflectevents or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or toreflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Factors that might cause the Corporation's future financial performance tovary include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the "Management'sDiscussion and Analysis" and "Supervision and Regulation" sections of thisreport, as well as the following:The Merger: Because of the inherent uncertainties associated with merging twolarge companies, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will be ablefully to realize the cost savings it currently expects to realize as a result ofthe merger or that such savings will be realized at the times currentlyanticipated. Currently unforeseen changes in real estate markets or personnelrequirements, if they occur, could affect the timing and magnitude of theanticipated savings. In addition, there is no assurance that the remaining workthat needs to be accomplished in order to complete fully the technologyintegration and systems conversions undertaken with the merger will be done onthe originally contemplated time schedule or at the originally estimated cost.Currently unanticipated problems in the merger integration process could, ifthey occur, delay the cost savings or increase the expenses of the merger beyondthe level originally anticipated.Competition: As noted above in Item 1 of this report, the Corporation operatesin a highly competitive environment. The Corporation expects that competitiveconditions will continue to intensify as a result of technological advances.Technological advances have, for example, made it possible for non-depositoryinstitutions to offer customers automatic transfer systems and other automatedpayment systems services that have been traditional banking products.Competition is also expected to increase as a result of legislation enacted in1994 permitting interstate banking. Legislation pending in Congress, which wouldpermit new types of affiliations between banks and financial service companies,including securities firms, could, if enacted, also have increased competitiveeffects (See, "Legislation and Pending Litigation" below).Foreign Operations: The Corporation does business throughout the world,including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets.The Corporation also invests in the securities of corporations located in suchemerging markets. The Corporation's businesses and revenues derived fromemerging markets securities are subject to risk of loss from unfavorablepolitical and diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, socialinstability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationaliza- 5  8tion, confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to foreignownership. In addition, foreign trading markets, particularly in emerging marketcountries, are often smaller, less liquid, and more volatile than the U.S.trading markets.Government Monetary Policies and Economic Controls: As noted above in Item 1 ofthis report, the earnings and business of the Corporation are affected bygeneral economic conditions, both domestic and international, and by the fiscalor other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of theUnited States, foreign governments, and international agencies. The nature andimpact of future changes in economic and market conditions and fiscal policiesare not predictable and beyond the Corporation's control. In addition, thesepolicies and conditions can impact the Corporation's customers andcounterparties, which may increase the risks of default on their obligations tothe Corporation.Legislation and Pending Litigation: Federal and state legislation affecting thebanking industry has played, and will continue to play, a significant role inshaping the nature of the financial services industry. For example, during 1994,the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the"Riegle Act") was enacted. The Riegle Act permitted, commencing September 29,1995, interstate banking under certain conditions relating to concentration ofdeposits. The Riegle Act also permits, commencing June 1, 1997 (subject toenactment by any state of "opt-out" legislation), interstate branching byconsolidation across state lines, of banks under the common control of a bankholding company. The States of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have"opted-in" early to the provisions of the Riegle Act. As a result, theCorporation was able to integrate the branches of its New Jersey and Connecticutbanks into Chase Bank, thereby increasing the operational efficiency of suchbranches. However, another effect of the early "opt-in" by New York, New Jerseyand Connecticut may be to increase competition within the tri-state region,although the Corporation cannot predict whether and to what extent suchcompetition will increase. The State of Texas has "opted-out" of the provisionsof the Riegle Act. Legislation is pending in Congress that would, if enacted, substantiallyreform the regulatory structure under which U.S. bank holding companies andother financial services institutions operate and could, therefore, haveimportant implications for the Corporation and other financial servicescompanies. Given the current status of these legislative efforts, it is notpossible for the Corporation to predict the extent to which the Corporation andits subsidiaries may be affected by any of these initiatives.Business Conditions and General Economy: The Corporation is a leading providerof services in the global markets, global services, investment banking, privatebanking and national consumer businesses. The profitability of these businesses,as well as the Corporation's credit quality, could be adversely affected by aworsening of general economic conditions, particularly by a higher domesticinterest rate environment, as well as by foreign and domestic trading marketconditions. An economic downturn or significantly higher interest rates couldincrease the risk that a greater number of the Corporation's customers wouldbecome delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Corporation, orwould refrain from securing additional debt. In addition, a higher level ofdomestic interest rates could affect the amount of assets under management bythe Corporation (for example, by affecting the flows of moneys to or from themutual funds managed by the Corporation), impact the willingness of financialinvestors to participate in loan syndications and underwritings managed by theCorporation's corporate finance business, adversely impact the Corporation'sloan and deposit spreads and affect its domestic trading revenues. Revenues fromforeign trading markets may also be subject to negative fluctuations as a resultof the impact of unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, socialinstability and changes in the policies of central banks or foreign governments,and the impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated by the volatility andlack of relative liquidity in some of these foreign trading markets.================================================================================Foreign OperationsFor geographic distributions of average assets, total revenue, total expense,income before income tax expense and net income, see Note Twenty Two of theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 89.
