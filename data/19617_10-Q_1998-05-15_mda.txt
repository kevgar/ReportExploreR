Chase's actual results may differ materially from those set forthin such forward-looking statements. Reference is made to Chase's reports filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the 1997 AnnualReport, for a discussion of factors that may cause such differences to occur.See Glossary of Terms on page 34 for a definition of terms used throughout the10-Q.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Operating net income for the 1998 first quarter increased to $1,053 million from$949 million in the first quarter of 1997. Diluted operating earnings per sharewere $2.35 in the first quarter of 1998, a 16% increase when compared with $2.02in the 1997 first quarter. The 1998 first quarter was marked by growing trading,investment banking, equity-related and Global Services revenues, as well as bysolid performance in National Consumer Services.For the first quarter of 1998, reported net income was $725 million or $1.59 pershare on a diluted basis, compared with $927 million or $1.97 per share in the1997 first quarter. The results for the 1998 first quarter reflected apreviously-announced, one time charge of $510 million ($320 million after-tax)taken in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions and realigncertain business functions. It is anticipated that annual savings from theseactions will amount to approximately $460 million, which will be reinvested inChase's high-growth businesses.First quarter 1998 financial highlights: - Operating diluted earnings per share rose 16%. - Total managed revenues increased 14% to $4.9 billion. - Return on common stockholders' equity rose to 20.3% from 19.6%.Total noninterest operating expenses were $2,610 million in the 1998 firstquarter, a 10% increase from the prior-year quarter, reflecting increasedincentives related to higher Global Banking revenues and increased investmentspending on new product offerings.The impact of economic conditions in Asia on 1998 first quarter results includedan increase in total nonperforming assets related to Asia (includingderivatives) to $243 million at March 31, 1998 and Asian commercial netcharge-offs for the 1998 first quarter of $92 million. Total exposure toIndonesia, Korea and Thailand was reduced by 26% to $7.5 billion at March 31,1998 from $10.1 billion at December 31, 1997. Total nonperforming assets atMarch 31, 1998 were $1,335 million compared with $1,018 million at December31,1997.As part of its Business Effectiveness Review Project, Chase launched ChaseBusiness Services on April 6th. Chase Business Services is Chase's "sharedservices" entity, intended to provide support services for Chase moreefficiently and at lower cost. Additionally, business restructuring in all threemajor lines of business was well underway by the end of the 1998 first quarter.In the first quarter of 1998, Chase raised the cash dividend on its common stockto $.72 per share, from $.62 per share.At March 31, 1998, Chase's Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were 8.1% and11.9%, respectively, and at March 31,1998, Chase and each of its depositoryinstitutions were "well capitalized". -13-  14- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------As of January 1,1998, Chase adopted Shareholder Value Added (SVA) as its primarymeasure of business unit performance. SVA represents operating earningsexcluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles (i.e., cashoperating earnings) less an explicit charge for allocated capital. For a furtherdiscussion of Chase's line of business franchises and its capital allocationmethod under SVA, reference is made to pages 21 and 24-25 of the 1997 AnnualReport.Lines of Business ResultsManagement measures Chase's financial performance and that of its business unitsbased on managed operating earnings, which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations, restructuring costs and special items.Note: Lines-of-business results are subject to restatement as appropriate whenever there are refinements in management reporting policies or changes to the management organization.(a) Only the global banking portion of Chase Texas is reported in the total Global Banking line of business results. The consumer- and global services-related results for Chase Texas are reported as part of National Consumer Services ("NCS") and Chase Technology Solutions ("CTS") lines of business results, respectively.(b) Total column includes Corporate results. See description of Corporate on page 17.(c) Trading-related net interest income is reflected in Noninterest Revenue - Managed.(d) Operating Earnings exclude restructuring costs and special items.(e) Cash Operating Earnings represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles.================================================================================Chase's financial performance goals over the next several years include anaverage return on common equity of 18% or higher, growth in managed operatingrevenues accelerating to 10% per year and double-digit growth in operatingearnings per share. -14-  15- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------GLOBAL BANKING- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Global Banking managed revenues rose 16% in the first quarter, with cashoperating earnings rising 18%. SVA increased by 42% to $317 million. Theseimprovements were driven by higher investment banking fees, trading-relatedrevenue and revenue from equity-related investments.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within Global Banking for the periods indicated.Global MarketsGlobal Markets' activities encompass the trading and sales of foreign exchange,derivatives, fixed income securities and commodities. As a leader in capitalmarkets, Chase operates 24 hours a day covering the major internationalcross-border financial markets, as well as many local markets, in both developedand emerging countries. Global Markets is a recognized world leader in such keyactivities as foreign exchange, interest rate swaps and emerging markets debt.Trading-related revenue for the first quarter of 1998 was $713 million, anincrease of 23% from 1997 first quarter's results. Improved conditions incapital markets worldwide enabled Chase to take advantage of an attractiveforeign exchange environment as well as fixed income opportunities, particularlywithin non-Asian emerging markets. The 1998 first quarter results reflectedhigher incentive costs. Also included within Global Markets are Chase's domesticand international treasury units, which have the primary responsibility forChase's asset/liability management activities ("ALM"). ALM activities in thetreasury units are managed on a total return basis with one of the primaryobjectives being the creation of economic value over time. Total return combinesthe reported revenues (net interest income and securities gains/losses) and thechange in the net unrealized appreciation/depreciation of all financialinstruments and underlying balance sheet items. In the first quarter of 1998,the total return from ALM activities amounted to $85 million pre-tax beforeexpenses.Global Investment Banking and Corporate LendingGlobal Investment Banking and Corporate Lending finances and advisescorporations, financial institutions, financial sponsors and governments byproviding integrated one-stop financial solutions and industry expertise toclients globally. Client industries include broker/dealers, chemicals,healthcare, insurance, media and telecommunications, multinationals, naturalresources, oil and gas, power and environmental, real estate, retail andtransportation. The product offerings encompass syndicated finance, high-yieldsecurities, mergers and acquisitions, project finance, restructuring, privateplacements, lease financing, trade finance and lending. Chase continues tomaintain its lead position in loan syndications and in leveraged finance. Cashoperating earnings in the first quarter of 1998 were $217 million, a $71 millionincrease when compared with 1997. The 1998 first quarter results reflectsignificant activity in loan syndications, as well as the growing contributionsof newer businesses, such as high-yield and investment-grade underwriting andmergers and acquisitions. -15-  16Chase Capital PartnersChase Capital Partners ("CCP") is a global private equity organization withapproximately $5.4 billion under management, including $4.0 billion inequity-related investments. CCP provides equity and mezzanine financing for awide variety of investment opportunities in the United States and abroad. Duringthe first quarter of 1998, CCP's direct investments totaled $371 million in 34venture capital, management buyout, recapitalization, growth equity andmezzanine transactions, compared with $124 million in 13 direct investmentsduring the same period in 1997. CCP cash operating earnings rose $77 million to$149 million for the 1998 first quarter, marking a continuation of favorableprivate and public equity markets and CCP's accelerated pace of investmentactivities over the last several years.Global Asset Management and Private BankingThe Global Asset Management and Private Banking Group serves a global clientbase of high net worth individuals, families, institutional and mutual fund andself-directed investors. Services include investment management forinstitutional investors globally, Chase Vista Mutual Funds (at March 31, 1998,the third largest bank-managed mutual fund family in the U.S.) and a full rangeof integrated private banking capabilities, investment management and advisoryservices, trust and estate planning, global custody, global mutual funds, creditand banking, and philanthropic advisory services. Total assets under managementamounted to $167 billion at March 31, 1998. Earnings for the first quarter of1998 were driven by a 9% growth in revenue reflecting higher trust fees.Middle MarketChase is the premier provider of financial services to middle-market companies(companies with sales ranging from $10 million to $500 million) regionally, witha national focus in selected industries. It is also the market leader in the NewYork metropolitan tri-state area where it has relationships with 53% of middlemarket companies and is lead bank for 25% of these companies. Cash operatingearnings for the first quarter of 1998 were $46 million, a $10 million decreasewhen compared with the 1997 results reflecting lower deposit volume and spreadsand a 12% increase in expenses.Chase TexasChase Texas is the primary bank for more large corporations and middle marketcompanies than any other bank in Texas. Chase Texas also maintains a strongconsumer banking presence through its 125 locations. Additionally, Chase Texasis the largest bank for personal and corporate trust services in the Southwest.Managed revenues for the first quarter of 1998 increased 14% from the 1997 firstquarter, reflecting continuing growth in fee-based activities, higher loan anddeposit volumes, and securities gains.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICES (NCS)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------For the first quarter of 1998, NCS's cash operating earnings were $287 million,a $17 million increase over the 1997 first quarter. The increase in cashoperating earnings is attributable to a 9% increase in revenue due primarily tothe acquisition of The Bank of New York's ("BONY") credit card portfolio inNovember 1997. NCS's expenses increased in the 1998 first quarter, primarily asa result of higher credit costs for credit cards and auto loans. SVA for the1998 first quarter was $54 million, compared with $81 million in the 1997 firstquarter. The decline in SVA is due to more capital being allocated to NCS as aresult of recent acquisitions.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within NCS for the periods indicated.(a) Insurance products, which are managed within Diversified Consumer Services, but included for reporting purposes in Cardmember Services, Regional Consumer Banking, and Chase Home Finance, generated revenues of $29 million and $24 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively.================================================================================ -16-  17Cardmember ServicesChase Cardmember Services ("CCS") ranks as the fourth largest bank card issuerin the United States with a $31 billion managed portfolio at March 31, 1998. CCSalso reflects the results of Chase's international consumer business, whichincludes The Manhattan Card Company Limited, the third-largest credit card issuer in Hong Kong (which became wholly owned in 1998), and includes consumer banking activities in Hong Kong, Panama and the Eastern Caribbean. CCS's cash operating earnings for the first quarter of 1998 were $111 million, a $31 million or 39% increase, over 1997. The increase was driven by a 20% revenue growth in the domestic portfolio, which benefited from the aforementioned BONY acquisition and increased co-branded activities. These positive results were partially offset by increased charge-offs and the effect of the economic environment in Asia on Chase's international consumer businesses.Regional Consumer BankingAt March 31, 1998, Regional Consumer Banking has a leading share of primary bankrelationships among consumers and small businesses in the New York metropolitantri-state area. It is also a leading retail institution in key Texas markets.Regional Consumer Banking offers customers convenient access to financialservices through the largest branch and proprietary ATM networks in the NYmetropolitan region plus state-of-the-art telephone, PC and Internet services.Cash operating earnings for the first quarter of 1998 were $84 million, a 9%decrease from first quarter 1997, reflecting higher expenses related to systemsintegration and enhancements, particularly within Chase Texas' retailbusinesses.Chase Home FinanceAt March 31, 1998, Chase Home Finance is the third-largest originator andservicer of residential mortgage loans in the U.S., serving more than 1.9million customers nationwide. It is also a leading provider of home-equitysecured lending and manufactured housing financing. At March 31, 1998, Chase'sresidential mortgage servicing portfolio totaled $171 billion. During the firstquarter of 1998, $16 billion in residential mortgage loans were originated. Cashoperating earnings improved to $66 million in the 1998 first quarter, a $4million increase from the comparable 1997 quarter, reflecting the continuedgrowth in mortgage originations partially offset by higher prepayments resultingfrom greater refinancing activity. Excluding the impact of two discontinuedproduct lines, cash operating earnings would have risen 14%.Diversified Consumer ServicesDiversified Consumer Services ("DCS") is a leading provider of automobilefinancing, student lending, and unsecured consumer lending. At March 31, 1998,Chase Auto Finance had $14 billion in retained outstandings with $3 billion innew originations for the first quarter of 1998. In addition to its financingactivities, DCS offers brokerage services, insurance and investment productsnationwide. DCS's revenues for the first quarter of 1998 increased 11% as aresult of loan growth. However, cash operating earnings of $25 million for thefirst quarter of 1998 declined 7%, when compared with the 1997 first quarter, asa result of higher expenses and an increase in the credit provision associatedwith the business volume growth.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CHASE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chase Technology Solutions ("CTS") combines Chase's global services businesses,information technology and operations, and electronic commerce initiatives intoa single group. Global Services is a leading provider of information andtransaction services globally and includes custody, cash management, trust andother fiduciary services. As the world's largest provider of global custody anda leader in trust and agency services, Global Services was custodian for over$4.7 trillion in assets and serviced over $3.0 trillion in outstanding debt atMarch 31, 1998. Global Services also operates the largest U.S. dollar fundstransfer business in the world and is a market leader in FedWire, ACH and CHIPSvolume. Cash operating earnings for Global Services in the first quarter of 1998was $119 million, an increase of $22 million or 23% from first quarter 1997. SVAfor Global Services in the 1998 first quarter was $73 million, a 52% increasewhen compared with first quarter 1997. These improvements resulted from revenuegrowth across all three businesses within Global Services (Chase TreasurySolutions, global investor services and global trust) reflecting increasedassets under trust and custody, higher deposit levels and the benefit of ongoingproductivity initiatives.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CORPORATE- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Corporate includes the effects remaining at the Corporate level after theimplementation of management accounting policies, including residual creditprovision and tax expense. Corporate also includes unallocated special items.For the first quarter of 1998, Corporate had a cash operating loss of $85million compared to a cash operating loss of $45 million in 1997. -17-  18Reconciliation of Reported Results to Managed Operating ResultsThe following supplemental information provides a reconciliation between Chase'sreported results and Chase's results on a managed operating basis.(a) Represents results reported in Chase's financial statements, except restructuring costs have been separately displayed and foreclosed property expense is included in credit costs.(b) Represents the impact of credit card securitizations. The line items on the income statement impacted are net interest income ($348 million in 1998 and $298 million in 1997), provision for credit losses ($280 million in 1998 and $214 million in 1997), credit card revenue ($66 million in 1998 and $68 million in 1997) and other revenue ($2 million in 1998 and $16 million in 1997).(c) Includes restructuring costs and special items. Restructuring costs reflect the $510 million pre-tax charge ($320 million after-tax) taken in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions, and residual costs of $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) related to the merger restructuring charge.(d) Includes restructuring costs and special items. Special items reflect a $44 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a partially-owned foreign investment and a $50 million pre-tax charge for the accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards.================================================================================ -18-  19- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The section below primarily discusses Chase's reported results of operations.Reported results include the impact of credit card securitizations,restructuring costs and special items.Net Interest Incomebp - Denotes basis points================================================================================Reported net interest income for the 1998 first quarter was $2,164 million, anincrease of $96 million from the 1997 first quarter reflecting a higher level ofinterest-earning assets, primarily loans (both consumer and commercial) andsecurities. The 20 basis point decline in net yield is primarily due togenerally narrower spreads on commercial and consumer loans and a higher levelof lower-yielding available-for-sale securities.Average interest-earning assets retained on the balance sheet increased by 12%in the first quarter of 1998 principally as a result of the increase in loanvolume and securities. The $17.5 billion increase in average loans retained wasequally divided between the consumer and commercial portfolios, while theincrease in securities was principally from the domestic available-for-saleportfolio. The growth in interest-earning assets was funded by higher depositlevels coupled with an increase in Federal funds purchased and securities soldunder repurchase agreements, which provided short-term funding fortrading-related positions.Provision for Credit LossesChase's provision for credit losses, which equaled net charge-offs, amounted to$344 million in the 1998 first quarter and $220 million in the 1997 firstquarter. For a discussion of Chase's net charge-offs, see the Credit RiskManagement Section on pages 24-27.Management expects that the provision for credit losses for full-year 1998 willbe higher than the full-year 1997 provision as a result of a higher volume ofcredit card outstandings as well as increased charge-offs from the Asiancommercial portfolio. -19-  20Noninterest RevenueThe 1998 first quarter was particularly strong (18% increase) with record ornear-record results in several key areas (notably trading, investment bankingand equity-related revenues as well as trust fees and credit card revenue).Investment banking fees of $361 million in the 1998 first quarter were more thandouble the $176 million of fees earned in the 1997 first quarter. These resultsreflect significant activity in loan syndications, as well as the growingcontribution of newer businesses such as high-yield and investment-gradeunderwriting and mergers and acquisitions. During the first quarter of 1998,Chase moved into the top ten in worldwide mergers and acquisitions advisorybusiness.(a) For the definitions of the above captions, see page 26 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.================================================================================Trust, custody and investment management fees rose 12% to a record $348 millionin the 1998 first quarter. These favorable results were largely attributable togrowth in assets under custody, expanded securities lending activity, and ahigher level of assets under management (including at Chase Vista mutualfunds).Credit card revenue rose $39 million, or 15%, in the 1998 first quarter as aresult of continued growth in managed outstandings, including the acquisition ofBONY's credit card portfolio in late 1997 and increased co-branded activities(notably Wal-Mart). The increase in revenue was partially offset by a rise innet charge-offs on the securitized portfolio, which reduced the excess servicingfees Chase received from the securitizations. Average managed credit cardreceivables grew to $31.8 billion in the first quarter of 1998, compared with$25.3 billion for the prior year's first quarter. For a further discussion ofthe credit card portfolio see page 25 of this Form 10-Q. -20-  21The higher level of loan commitment fees for the 1998 first quarter was largelya reflection of increased activity in Chase's acquisition financing business.Higher fees related to insurance products, investment services and from loanssecuritized during the latter half of 1997 contributed to the increase in otherfees.(a) Trading-related net interest income includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(b) For the classes of financial instruments included, see Note Two of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.================================================================================Trading-related revenues of $713 million for the 1998 first quarter representsanother record quarter, rebounding sharply from the fourth quarter 1997 leveland 23% above last year's first quarter results. Improved conditions in capitalmarkets worldwide enabled Chase to take advantage of a favorable foreignexchange environment, as well as fixed income opportunities, particularly withinnon-Asian emerging markets.Interest rate contract revenues declined modestly, mainly due to weaker resultsin the U.S., especially in several structured products. The rise in foreignexchange revenue reflected strong earnings across a broad spectrum ofcurrencies, with particular emphasis on Asian markets where volatility continuedto remain high. The improvement in debt instruments and other revenue wasattributable to strong performances from various non-interest rate derivativeproduct lines, as well as strong markets in Eastern European and Latin Americandebt instruments.Trading revenues are affected by many factors, including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by Chase onbehalf of its customers, volatility associated with the introduction of theeuro, Chase's success in proprietary positioning, the credit standing of Chase,and the steps taken by central banks and governments which affect financialmarkets. Chase expects its trading revenues will fluctuate as these factors varyfrom period to period.Securities gains of $83 million were realized in connection with Chase'sasset/liability management activities. There were lower gains on sales ofsecurities overseas during the 1998 first quarter when compared with the prioryear's first quarter, which were partially offset by higher gains in the currentquarter from sales of U.S. Government and agency securities. -21-  22 Revenue from equity-related investments includes income from a wide variety ofinvestments both in the United States and abroad. The 1998 first quarter resultsof $287 million were a record for Chase and were significantly higher than theprior year's quarter and the quarterly average of approximately $192 million forthe previous eight quarters. The higher revenue reflects continued favorableconditions in the private and public equity markets and Chase's accelerated paceof investment activities over the last several years. At March 31, 1998, thecarrying value of Chase's equity-related investments approximated $4.0 billion.Chase believes that equity-related investments will continue to makecontributions to its earnings, although the timing of the recognition of gainsis unpredictable and revenues could vary significantly from period to period.Other revenue, which includes gains and losses from the sale of nonstrategicassets and from securitizations, amounted to $96 million, a decline of $95million from the prior year's first quarter. The 1998 first quarter resultsincluded higher revenue from residential mortgage origination and salesactivities, a result of a favorable interest rate environment. The 1997 firstquarter results included a $44 million gain on the sale of a partially-ownedforeign investment, as well as gains on sales of other nonstrategic assets andon asset securitizations. The 1997 first quarter also include $14 million ofequity income from Chase's investment in CIT Group Holdings, Inc. (Chase'sremaining 20% interest in CIT was sold in the fourth quarter of 1997).Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense, excluding restructuring costs, was $2,614 million in the1998 first quarter, an increase of 8% from the first quarter of 1997. Increasedrevenues across a spectrum of Global Banking businesses contributed to anincrease in incentive costs. The balance of the increase reflects operatingcosts related to portfolio acquisitions, investment spending on new productofferings and Year 2000, Economic and Monetary Union ("EMU") integration andother technology spending. Noninterest expense including restructuring costs was$3,135 million in the 1998 first quarter, a 28% increase from the 1997 firstquarter.(a) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.================================================================================The increase in salaries for the 1998 first quarter was primarily due to higherincentive costs as a result of higher earnings across a number of businesses,investments in selected growth businesses, and competitive market pressuresacross many segments of Global Banking. Included in the 1997 first quarterresults was a charge of $50 million reflecting the accelerated vesting ofstock-based incentive awards. -22-  23The increased staff levels during the 1998 first quarter were primarily in NCS,reflecting increased activities, primarily due to portfolio acquisitions andvolume growth.The higher level of equipment expense was primarily the result of increasedsoftware expense to integrate and enhance processing systems throughout Chase,and technology expenditures necessary to support targeted growth businesses.Other expense for the 1998 first quarter increased by $44 million due toincreases in the amortization of intangibles and all other expenses. Thepurchase of the BONY credit card portfolio in late 1997 contributed to theincrease in amortization expense. In addition, increased servicing costs for theportfolio contributed to an increase in all other expense. Professional servicescosts reflected higher levels of contract computer professionals associated withplanned Year 2000 and the EMU efforts. Lower credit card marketing costs, and adecline in minority interest expense due to the consolidation of a foreigninvestment in the 1998 first quarter, partially offset these increases.For a further discussion of Chase's Year 2000 and the EMU efforts, see pages 28-29 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.For a discussion of Chase's restructuring costs, see Note Four on page 8.Income TaxesChase recognized income tax expense of $425 million (at a 37% effective taxrate) in the first quarter of 1998, compared with $556 million (at a 37.5%effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 1997. -23-  24- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1997 and should be read in conjunction withpages 29-37 and 52 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans secured by mortgages on 1-4 family residential properties.(b) Total loans on a managed basis at March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997 were $186,067 million and $185,306 million, respectively.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -24-  25Loan SummaryThe slight decrease in loans outstanding is a result of a reduction incommercial loans. Based upon industry classifications utilized by Chase, therewere no commercial and industrial industry segments which exceeded 5% of totalcommercial and industrial loans outstanding.Chase's nonperforming assets at March 31, 1998 increased $317 million from the1997 year-end level primarily due to an increase in nonperforming Asian assetsand in nonperforming domestic commercial loans. Management expects that duringthe remainder of 1998, there will be an increase in nonperforming assets fromthe March 31, 1998 level, primarily as a result of continuing uncertainty in thefinancial conditions of certain Asian countries.Total net charge-offs on a retained basis increased $124 million during the 1998first quarter. Total net charge-offs on a managed basis (which excludes theimpact of credit card securitizations) were $624 million in the 1998 firstquarter, compared with $434 million in the first quarter of 1997. The increasein net charge-offs on both a managed and retained basis is due to the generallylower credit quality of a recently acquired credit card portfolio, a factorwhich was anticipated at the time of its acquisition, and increased foreigncommercial charge-offs primarily as a result of conditions in Asia.Consumer PortfolioDomestic ConsumerResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $42.6 billion atMarch 31, 1998, a $3.9 billion increase during 1998, reflecting a lower interestrate environment which has increased consumer demand. At March 31, 1998,nonperforming domestic residential mortgage loans, as a percentage of theportfolio, was 0.88%, unchanged from the 1997 year-end level.Credit Card Loans: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a "managedbasis", which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well ascredit card receivables that have been securitized.The following table presents credit-related information for Chase's manageddomestic credit card receivables.The $6.5 billion increase in average managed credit card receivables is largelythe result of the purchase of a credit card portfolio in late 1997, totalingapproximately $4.0 billion in outstandings. The increase in net charge-offpercentage is due to the generally lower credit quality of that portfolio.Management expects that domestic credit card net charge-offs, as a percentage ofaverage managed credit card receivables, will increase modestly in 1998 whencompared with 1997.Auto Financings: The increase in retained auto financings outstanding reflectedcontinued strong consumer demand due to favorable pricing programs, partiallyoffset by the impact of auto loan securitizations. Total originations were $3.0billion in the first three months of 1998, compared with $2.8 billion in 1997.Net charge-offs related to auto financings were $23 million in the 1998 firstquarter, compared with $12 million in 1997. The increased level of netcharge-offs related to auto financings in 1998 primarily reflects growth in theportfolio and the unfavorable performance in a discontinued product line. -25-  26Commercial PortfolioDomestic CommercialThe solid performance in the domestic commercial portfolio continued during the1998 first quarter as net charge-off levels remained low and the portfoliocontinued to maintain its strong credit quality.Foreign CommercialThe foreign commercial portfolio totaled $37.3 billion at March 31, 1998, adecrease of $1.5 billion from the 1997 year-end. Nonperforming loan levels atMarch 31, 1998, as well as net charge-off levels for the 1998 first quarter,increased in comparison with the respective prior year periods, due to financialconditions in Asia.Total nonperforming assets in Asia, including derivatives, increased by $161million from year-end levels to $243 million at March 31, 1998. Asian commercialnet charge-offs, including derivatives, for the 1998 first quarter were $92million compared with a net recovery of $1 million in the 1997 first quarter.Derivative and Foreign Exchange Financial InstrumentsFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instrumentsutilized in connection with Chase's trading and ALM activities, see pages 35-36and Notes One and Eighteen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. At March 31, 1998, themajority of these transactions were with commercial bank and financialinstitution counterparties, most of which are dealers in these products. Thefollowing table provides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreignexchange contracts outstanding at March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997.Chase's net charge-offs arising from derivative and foreign exchangetransactions were $12 million in the 1998 first quarter compared with none in1997. At March 31,1998, nonperforming derivative contracts were $40 millioncompared with none in 1997. The increases in both net charge-offs andnonperforming derivative contracts were due to the financial conditions in Asia.Cross-Border ExposureCredits denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which aborrower is located, such as dollar-denominated loans made overseas, are called"cross-border" credits. The Asian financial turmoil, which started in July 1997,affected many countries where Chase has had long-standing banking relationships.The following table presents Chase's cross-border exposure to selected Asiancountries. For a further discussion of Chase's cross-border exposure to Asiancountries, see pages 34-35 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.(a) Includes loans and accrued interest, interest-bearing deposits with banks, trading debt and equity instruments, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit, undrawn commitments to extend credit and local currency assets, net of local currency liabilities.(b) Foreign exchange largely represents the mark-to-market exposure of spot and forward contracts. Derivatives largely represent the mark-to-market exposure of risk management instruments. Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the value of a foreign exchange or derivative contract in the open market. The impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements on these foreign exchange and derivative contracts reduced exposure by $0.9 billion at March 31,1998 and $0.7 billion at December 31, 1997.================================================================================ -26-  27Allowance for Credit LossesThe following discussion of Chase's allowance for credit losses focusesprimarily on developments since December 31, 1997 and should be read inconjunction with pages 36-37 and Note Five of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The accompanying tables reflect the activity in and composition of Chase'sallowance for credit losses and certain coverage ratios related to the allowancefor credit losses on loans for the periods indicated.Chase deems its allowance for credit losses at March 31, 1998 to be adequate(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that may currently exist in the portfolio,but are not yet identifiable). The allowance is a general allowance availablefor all credit activities. Estimating potential future losses is inherentlyuncertain and depends on many factors, including general macroeconomic andpolitical conditions, rating migration, structural changes within industrieswhich alter competitive positions, event risk, unexpected correlations withinthe portfolio, and other external factors such as legal and regulatoryrequirements. Chase periodically reviews such factors and reassesses theadequacy of the allowance for credit losses. -27-  28- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1997 and should be read in conjunction withpages 37-41 and Notes One and Eighteen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.Chase uses both historic simulation and Monte Carlo statistical techniques toestimate a daily value-at-risk ("VAR"). The VAR calculation is performed for allmaterial trading portfolios and market risk-related ALM portfolios, with resultsreported by business unit and in the aggregate. The total VAR for Chase'strading portfolio and market risk-related ALM portfolio as of or for the twelvemonth period ended March 31, 1998 was as follows:NM: Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect.================================================================================Chase's average aggregate VAR (VAR for both trading and ALM activities), for thetwelve month period ended March 31, 1998, was $56.3 million. Chase's aggregateVAR at March 31, 1998 was $48.6 million. Chase's aggregate average and periodend VAR are less than the sum of the respective trading and ALM VARs shown inthe above table due to risk-offsets resulting from portfolio diversificationwhich occur across the trading and ALM portfolios.Chase was among the earliest adopters of the Basle market risk capital rules.Both for regulatory compliance with the Basle rules and for internal evaluationof VAR, Chase conducts daily backtesting of its VAR against trading revenues.For aggregate mark-to-market activities, there were no days in the first quarterof 1998 in which VAR was exceeded by a daily trading loss.Management believes stress tests are an essential complement to VAR. At Chase,stress tests are an integral part of an effective risk management process, andhave assumed an equal standing to VAR as a risk measurement and controltechnique for market risk. As of March 31, 1998, Chase conducted monthly stresstests, consisting of five historical and three hypothetical scenarios, for allmaterial trading portfolios and market risk-related ALM portfolios. SinceDecember 31, 1997, stress test results have been incorporated into Chase'sinternal capital allocation methodology, which provides a significant incentivefor active management of aggregate exposures to difficult market environments. -28-  29Trading ActivitiesThe following chart contains a histogram of Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of marked-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income. [GRAPHIC OF DAILY CHANGES IN MARKET RISK-RELATED TRADING REVENUE - SEE APPENDIX I]Based on actual trading results for the twelve months ended March 31, 1998,Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 229 out of 259business trading days with 85 days exceeding positive $15 million over the pasttwelve months. This compares with 42 days exceeding positive $15 million for thetwelve months ended March 31, 1997. The large increase in days exceedingpositive $15 million reflected continued efforts to build key tradingactivities. Chase incurred five daily trading losses in excess of negative $15million over the past twelve months. Four of these five losses resulted fromsharp price declines and a loss of liquidity for certain securities,particularly emerging market debt instruments, during the difficult andunusually volatile trading markets in late October 1997.Asset/Liability ManagementMeasuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: Chase, as part of its ALM process, employsa variety of cash (primarily securities) and derivatives instruments in managingits exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. In managing exposure,Chase uses quantifications of net gap exposure and measurements of earnings atrisk (the risk to earnings from adverse movements in interest rates) based onearnings simulations. An example of aggregate net gap analysis is presentedbelow.Condensed Interest-Rate Sensitivity Table -29-  30At March 31, 1998, Chase had $24.0 billion more liabilities than assetsrepricing within one year (including the net repricing effects of derivativepositions), or 7% of total assets. This compares with $17.8 billion moreliabilities than assets repricing within one year, or 5% of total assets, atDecember 31, 1997.At March 31, 1998, based on Chase's simulation model and applying immediateincreases in various market interest rates (100 bp increase for USdollar-denominated positions and 100 bp to 1500 bp increases for non-USdollar-denominated positions), earnings at risk over the next twelve months areestimated to be approximately 5.5% of projected 1998 after-tax income (beforerestructuring costs). At December 31, 1997, Chase's earnings at risk to animmediate rise in interest rates was estimated to be approximately 3.5% ofafter-tax income. The increase in earnings at risk from year-end reflects ahigher level of fixed-rate investment securities funded by floating-rateliabilities. The hypothetical rate shocks are used to calibrate risk that Chasebelieves to be reasonably possible of occurring in the near-term, but thesescenarios do not necessarily represent management's current view of futuremarket developments.Impact of ALM Derivative Activity:The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's ALM activities at March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997.(a) These net unrecognized losses do not include the net favorable impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.================================================================================- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chase, like all large financial institutions, is exposed to many types ofoperating risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders,unauthorized transactions by employees, and errors relating to computer andtelecommunications systems. Chase maintains a system of controls that isdesigned to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of the financialstrength of Chase, the characteristics of the businesses and markets in whichChase operates, competitive circumstances and regulatory considerations.However, from time to time in the past, Chase has suffered losses from operatingrisk and there can be no assurance that Chase will not suffer such losses in thefuture.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 41-43 and NoteSeventeen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.CapitalChase's capital levels at March 31, 1998 remained well in excess of regulatoryguidelines. At March 31, 1998, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 8.1% and11.9%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.0%. At March 31, 1998,the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was$33.3 billion, the same level as at December 31, 1997. The amount of retainedearnings (net income less common and preferred dividends) generated during thefirst quarter of 1998 and the issuance of $200 million (net of discount) ofcapital securities issued during the quarter by certain Chase subsidiaries (seeNote 7 of this Form 10-Q), was offset by the redemption of preferred stock. -30-  31In the first quarter of 1998, Chase raised the cash dividend on its Common Stockto $.72 per share from $.62 per share. Management currently expects that Chase'sdividend policy will generally be to pay a Common Stock dividend equal toapproximately 25% to 35% of Chase's operating net income, less the amount ofpreferred stock dividends. Chase's future dividend policies will be determinedby its Board of Directors, taking into consideration Chase's earnings andfinancial condition and applicable governmental regulations and policies.From inception of a stock buy-back program authorized by Chase's Board ofDirectors in October 1996 through March 31, 1998, Chase repurchased 33.2 millionshares of its Common Stock ($3.3 billion) and reissued from treasuryapproximately 18.4 million shares of its Common Stock ($1.5 billion) under itsbenefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of 14.8 million shares.Management is committed to maintaining a disciplined capital policy for Chase.That policy is intended to increase SVA, to employ capital to support growth,including through acquisitions or other investment opportunities, and to returnexcess capital to stockholders. In light of management's current target ratiofor Tier 1 Capital of 8% to 8.25%, and Chase's pending acquisition of a globalcustody business (see "Other Events" below), management currently believes Chasemay not repurchase the full amount of shares permitted to be purchased under thestock buy-back program, which expires at year-end. The extent to which CommonStock is purchased by Chase during the remainder of the year will depend onChase's future earnings, internal asset growth and future investmentopportunities.On March 17, 1998, Chase's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stocksplit, subject to stockholder approval at Chase's annual meeting on May 19th. Ifapproved by the stockholders, the stock split is intended to be effective at theclose of business on May 20, 1998.LiquidityChase manages its liquidity in order to ensure the availability of sufficientcash flows to meet all of Chase's financial commitments and to capitalize onopportunities for Chase's business expansion. Chase is an active participant inthe capital markets and issues commercial paper, medium-term notes, long-termdebt, and common and preferred stock. At March 31, 1998, Chase's long-term debtwas $14,355 million. Chase issued $1,631 million of long-term debt during thefirst three months of 1998; during the same period, $534 million of long-termdebt matured and $128 million was redeemed. During the first quarter of 1998,Chase redeemed $200 million of its 7.92% cumulative preferred stock and $172million of its 8.40% cumulative preferred stock and called for redemption $200million of its 7.58% cumulative preferred stock (which was redeemed April 1,1998). An additional $340 million of Chase's fixed-rate preferred stock becomescallable in 1998. Chase constantly evaluates the opportunities to redeem itsoutstanding debt and preferred stock in light of current market conditions.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-5 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.DividendsChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $1.7 billion atMarch 31, 1998.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER EVENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------On May 7, 1998, Chase and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. ("Morgan Stanley")reached a definitive agreement under which Chase will acquire the global custodybusiness of Morgan Stanley, which has more than $400 billion of assets undercustody. The acquisition is expected to be completed during the latter part of1998. The clients and staff joining Chase will be integrated into Chase GlobalInvestor Services, which is part of Chase's Global Services Business included inCTS. -31-  32 The Chase Manhattan Corporation and Subsidiaries Average Consolidated Balance Sheet, Interest and Rates (Taxable-Equivalent Interest and Rates; in millions)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the three months ended March 31, 1998 and March 31, 1997, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.55% and 6.69%, respectively.(c) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -32-  33 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION and Subsidiaries QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (in millions, except per share data) -33-  34- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GLOSSARY OF TERMS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The page numbers included after each definition represents the pages in the 10-Qwhere the term is primarily used.1997 Annual Report: Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,1997.
