Forward-looking statementsprovide JPMorgan Chase's current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, resultsor aspirations. JPMorgan Chase's disclosures in this report contain forward-looking statementswithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may makeforward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the Securities andExchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). In addition, the Firm's senior management may make forward-lookingstatements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. JPMorganChase's actual future results may differ materially from those set forth in its forward-lookingstatements. Factors that could cause this difference&#150;many of which are beyond the Firm'scontrol&#150;include the following: local, regional and international business, political or economicconditions; changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws; technological changesinstituted by the Firm and by other entities which may affect the Firm's business; mergers andacquisitions, including the Firm's ability to integrate acquisitions; ability of the Firm todevelop new products and services; acceptance of new products and services and the ability of theFirm to increase market share; ability of the Firm to control expenses; competitive pressures;changes in laws and regulatory requirements; changes in applicable accounting policies; costs,outcomes and effects of litigation and regulatory investigations; changes in the credit quality ofthe Firm's customers; and adequacy of the Firm's risk management framework.Additional factors that may cause future results to differ materially from forward-lookingstatements are discussed in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1A: Risk Factors in the Firm's 2005 Annual Report, towhich reference is hereby made. There is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties orrisk factors is complete.Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they aremade and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect theimpact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.The reader should, however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-looking nature the Firmmay make in any subsequent Annual Reports on Form&nbsp;10-K, itsQuarterly Reports on Form&nbsp;10-Q andits Current Reports on Form&nbsp;8-K.104 Table of ContentsItem&nbsp;3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the MarketRisk Management section of the MD&A on pages 64&#150;66 of thisForm&nbsp;10-Q.Item&nbsp;4 Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under thesupervision and with the participation of the Firm's management, including its Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of itsdisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a&#150;15(e) under the Securities Exchange Actof 1934). See Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certification statements issued by the Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer andChief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls andprocedures were effective.OnAugust&nbsp;3, 2006, the Firm filed an amended 2005 Form&nbsp;10-K to restate the Consolidated statementsof cash flows for the annual periods of 2005, 2004 and 2003 and anamended Form&nbsp;10-Q to restatethe Consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the quarterly periods of 2005 and the firstquarter of 2006. The restatements did not affect the Firm's Consolidated statements of income,Consolidated balance sheets or Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity for anyof the affected periods. Accordingly, the Firm's historical revenues, net income, earnings pershare, total assets and regulatory capital remained unchanged.The restatements resulted solely from the misclassification of cash flows related to certainresidential mortgages and other loans that had been originated or purchased with the intent tosell. The cash flows from these loans had been classified as investing activities. However, inaccordance with SFAS 102, cash flows from these loans should have been, and in the future will be,classified as operating activities, rather than investing activities. Accordingly, the restatementssolely affected the classification of these activities and the subtotals of cash flows fromoperating and investing activities presented in the affected Consolidated statements of cash flows,but they had no impact on the net increase (decrease)&nbsp;in total Cash and due from banks set forth inthe Consolidated statements of cash flows for any of the previously reported periods.There was no change in the Firm's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule13a&#150;15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the third quarter of 2006that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm's internalcontrol over financial reporting.Part II Other InformationItem&nbsp;1 Legal proceedingsThe following information supplements and amends the disclosure set forth under Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3&#147;Legal proceedings&#148; in the Firm's 2005 Annual Report; Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Legal proceedings&#148; in theFirm's Quarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarterly period ending March&nbsp;31, 2006; and Part&nbsp;II,Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; in the Firm'sQuarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarterly periodending June&nbsp;30, 2006.Enron litigation. On September&nbsp;29, 2006, in the putative class action on behalf of JPMorgan Chaseemployees who participated in the Firm's 401(k) plan alleging claims under the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act, the Untied States District Court for the Southern District of New York grantedsummary judgment to defendants with respect to certain claims and ordered plaintiffs to show causewhy the remaining claims should not be dismissed as well. On September&nbsp;20, 2006, the plaintifffiled an amended complaint in the shareholder derivative action originally filed in March&nbsp;2006 inthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The defendants filed amotion to dismiss this amended complaint on October&nbsp;11, 2006.National Century Financial Enterprises litigation. The June&nbsp;28, 2006, settlement with the NYCPension Funds Noteholders has been completed. On October&nbsp;2, 2006, the MDL court issued rulings onsome of the motions to dismiss filed on behalf of the Firm and its affiliates, granting the motionsin part and denying the motions in part.In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations discussed above, JPMorgan Chaseand its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of other legal actions and governmentalproceedings arising in connection with their businesses. Additional actions, investigations orproceedings may be brought from time to time in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty ofpredicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large orindeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legal theories, involve a large number ofparties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what theeventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution ofthese matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending mattermay be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counseland after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the outcome of the legalactions, proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material,adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Firm. However, in light of theuncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions and investigations, there is no assurance thatthe ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currentlyaccrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase's results for a particular period, depending upon, among other factors, the size of the lossor liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.105 Table of ContentsItem&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of the risk factors affecting the Firm, see Part&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;1A, Risk Factors, onpages 4&#150;6 and Forward-Looking Statements on page 135 of JPMorganChase's 2005 Form&nbsp;10-K.Additionally, certain additional risks and uncertainties should be considered in connection withthe Firm's October&nbsp;1, 2006 acquisition of The Bank of New York's consumer, small business andmiddle market banking business in exchange for selected portions of the Firm's corporate trustbusiness plus a cash payment of $150&nbsp;million. These additional risks and uncertainties include:changes in the financial performance of the businesses the Firm has purchased; adjustment paymentsor other post-closing requirements; difficulties or delays in converting the businesses between theparties' information systems, or any inability to integrate thebusinesses being purchased asfully, or in as timely or cost-efficient a manner, as expected; and costs associated with thetransaction, or employee or customer attrition being greater than expected.Item&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the third quarter of 2006, there were no shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant toSection&nbsp;4(2) thereof.On March&nbsp;21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program which authorizes therepurchase of up to $8&nbsp;billion of the Firm's common shares. The new stock repurchase programreplaces the Firm's previous repurchase authorization. The amount authorized includes shares to berepurchased to offset issuances under the Firm's employee stock-based plans. The actual amount ofshares repurchased is subject to various factors, including: market conditions; legal considerationsaffecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking intoaccount goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative potentialinvestment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets ortimetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions orutilizing Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.For the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2006, under the respective stock repurchaseprograms then in effect, the Firm repurchased a total of 20.0&nbsp;million shares and 69.5&nbsp;millionshares for $900&nbsp;million and $2.9&nbsp;billion at an average price per share of $44.88 and $42.22,respectively.

As of September&nbsp;30, 2006, $6.2&nbsp;billion of authorized repurchasecapacity remained under the new stock repurchase program.The Firm has determined that it may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate the repurchase of common stock inaccordance with the repurchase program. A Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 repurchase plan would allow the Firm torepurchase shares during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common stock &#150; forexample, during internal trading &#147;black-out periods.&#148; All purchases under a Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 plan mustbe made according to a predefined plan that is established when the Firm is not aware of materialnonpublic information.106 Table of ContentsThe Firm's repurchases of equity securities during the third quarter and the first nine months of2006 were as follows:In addition to the repurchases disclosed above, participants in the Firm's stock-basedincentive plans may have shares withheld to cover income taxes.
