Excluding these items, net income was $2,615 million, primary earnings per share was $5.50, fully-diluted earnings per share was $5.42 and return on common stockholders' equity was 18.43%. -16-  17Certain forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to risks anduncertainties. Chase's actual results may differ materially from those set forthin such forward-looking statements. Reference is made to Chase's reports filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the Form 8-K datedOctober 21, 1997, and the 1996 Annual Report for a discussion of factors thatmay cause such differences to occur. See Glossary of Terms on page 47 for adefinition of terms used throughout the 10-Q.OVERVIEWChase's net income before restructuring costs for the 1997 third quarter was$1,027 million, an increase of 17%, when compared with the 1996 third quarter.Primary earnings per share ("primary EPS") and fully diluted earnings per share("fully-diluted EPS") in the third quarter of 1997 both rose 23% from thecomparable 1996 quarter. Reported net income in the 1997 third quarter was $982million, up 14% from the 1996 third quarter. Primary and fully-diluted EPS onreported net income were $2.17 and $2.16, respectively, in 1997, both up 21%from the 1996 third quarter.Net income before restructuring costs for the first nine months of 1997 was$2,942 million, an increase of $257 million from the same 1996 period. Primaryand fully-diluted EPS for the first nine months of 1997 both increased 13% to$6.40 and $6.32, respectively, compared with the same periods of 1996. Reportednet income for the first nine months of 1997 was $2,834 million compared with$1,625 million for 1996. Primary and fully-diluted EPS increased for the firstnine months of 1997 to $6.16 and $6.08, respectively, from $3.28 and $3.23,respectively, in 1996.Chase's total operating revenue for the 1997 third quarter was $4,409 million,an increase of 12% from the same 1996 period. For the first nine months of1997, total operating revenue increased to $12,655 million, or 6%, from thecomparable 1996 period. On a managed basis, which excludes the impact of creditcard securitizations, total operating revenue for the 1997 third quarterincreased 15% to $4,677 million and for the 1997 first nine months increased 9%to $13,425 million. The increases for both periods were due to growth invarious businesses including consumer credit, asset management and privatebanking, operating services, trading and investment banking.The 1997 third quarter included incremental merger savings of $130 million,which were offset by investment spending and increased incentive costs relatedto higher revenues. The 1997 third quarter also included $85 million of expensesdue to the accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards and restructuringexpenses of $71 million. Total noninterest expenses, before merger-relatedrestructuring costs, and excluding the aforementioned $85 million charge, rose9% in the 1997 third quarter.Chase's efficiency ratio improved to 56.7% for the third quarter of 1997(excluding the aforementioned $85 million charge), compared with 58.2% for thecomparable 1996 period. Excluding the impact of credit card securitizations, theefficiency ratio for the third quarters of 1997 and 1996 was 53.4% and 56.1%,respectively.During the 1997 third quarter, Chase purchased approximately 7.0 million commonshares as part of a stock repurchase plan announced in October of 1996 and alsoreissued approximately 4.3 million treasury shares under its employee benefitplans, resulting in a net repurchase of 2.7 million shares. From the inceptionof the program through September 30, 1997, Chase has repurchased 31.4 millioncommon shares ($3.0 billion) and reissued approximately 11.3 million treasuryshares under its benefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of 20.1 millionshares ($2.1 billion).During the third quarter, Chase elected early adoption of the Federal ReserveBoard's new guidelines for calculating market risk-adjusted capital. Theseguidelines incorporate the use of internal models to measure market risk. Inaddition, the capital and assets of Chase Securities Inc. are included in thecalculation of risk-based capital ratios. Giving effect to the adoption of theseguidelines, Chase's Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios were 7.8% and11.6%, respectively, and its leverage ratio was 6.0% at September 30, 1997.MARKET DEVELOPMENTS SINCE SEPTEMBER 30, 1997In the latter part of October, trading markets became difficult and unusuallyvolatile. There were sharp declines and a loss of liquidity for certainsecurities, particularly emerging markets securities.As a result of these market developments, Chase's trading revenue (includingtrading-related net interest income) for the month of October amounted to a lossof approximately $160 million before tax.The October trading results and the ongoing uncertain market environment presentsome risk that Chase will be unable to achieve its previously announced 1997target of 15% annual growth in operating earnings per share.Chase's other previously announced 1997 financial goals are: managed revenuegrowth of 6% to 8%; return on common stockholders' equity of 19%; an efficiencyratio of between 54% and 55%; and incremental merger savings of $635 million to$680 million. -17-  18RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNET INTEREST INCOMEReported net interest income for the 1997 third quarter was $2,046 million, anincrease of $20 million from the 1996 third quarter. For the first nine months,net interest income was $6,079 million in 1997, a decrease of $48 million fromthe 1996 level (excluding $54 million of interest income, in 1996, related toFederal and State tax audit settlements). Excluding the impact ofsecuritizations and the 1996 tax audit settlements, net interest income on amanaged basis increased 4% in the 1997 third quarter and 3% for the first ninemonths of 1997, reflecting a higher level of liquid interest-earning assets tosupport Chase's trading businesses.(a) Excludes $54 million of interest income related to tax audit settlements which was considered a nonrecurring item.(b) Reflected on a taxable equivalent basis in order to permit comparison of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets. For net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis, and additional information on average balances and rates, see the Average Balance Sheets on pages 44 and 45.The reported and managed net yields on average interest-earning assets decreasedin the 1997 third quarter and first nine months compared with the same 1996periods. The declines in net yield are primarily due to a higher level oflower-yielding liquid assets, driven by Chase's trading businesses, andgenerally narrower spreads on interest-earning assets. -18-  19Average interest-earning assets retained on the balance sheet increased by 10%in the third quarter of 1997 and 9% in the first nine months of 1997,principally as a result of the increase in liquid interest-earning assets.Liquid interest-earning assets (in particular trading-related assets) increasedin the 1997 third quarter and first nine months by 18% and 22%, respectively.Average total loans (both commercial and consumer) and securities also increasedin both 1997 periods, but decreased slightly as a percentage of totalinterest-earning assets. The growth in interest-earning assets in both 1997periods was funded by an increase in Federal funds purchased and securities soldunder repurchase agreements, which provide short-term funding fortrading-related positions. Additionally, higher deposit levels and otherborrowings also contributed to funding the growth in interest-earning assets.AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETSManagement anticipates that, given its current expectations for interest ratemovements for the remainder of 1997, Chase's managed net interest income in 1997will be approximately 3% higher than in 1996 (excluding the impact of tax auditsettlements in 1996).PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSESChase's provision for credit losses, which has equaled net charge-offs, amountedto $190 million in the 1997 third quarter and $599 million for the first ninemonths of 1997. These results compare with $220 million and $715 million,respectively, for the prior year's periods. The decreases in the provision werethe result of lower consumer net charge-offs on a retained basis as well aslower domestic commercial net charge-offs. Commercial net charge-offs remainedat historically low levels, consistent with the prior year.Management currently expects that the provision for credit losses for full-year1997 (which is anticipated to continue to equal net charge-offs) will be equalto or lower than the full-year 1996 provision. This is primarily a result of thecontinued strong performance in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio.For a discussion of Chase's net charge-offs, see the Credit Risk ManagementSection on pages 30-36. -19-  20NONINTEREST REVENUENoninterest revenue rose 24% and 15% for the 1997 third quarter and nine monthperiods, respectively, reflecting a broad spectrum of fee-based and, inparticular, market sensitive increases. The 1997 third quarter was particularlystrong with record results in several key areas (notably trading, corporatefinance and equity-related revenues, which are market sensitive categories, andtrust fees). Chase continues to generate overall fee growth by offering clientsintegrated financing and advisory solutions and new products and by generatingnew business. Noninterest revenue in the first nine months of 1997 included a$44 million gain on the sale of a partially-owned foreign investment and in 1996included a $60 million loss on the sale of a building in Japan.FEES AND COMMISSIONS Corporate finance and syndication fees of $308 million in the 1997 thirdquarter increased by $71 million, or 30%, over the 1996 third quarter andexceeded the record second quarter 1997 levels by 9%. These results are due tostrong investment banking deal flow, reflecting market share gains in high-yieldand investment-grade debt underwriting. Corporate finance and syndication feesfor the first nine months of 1997 rose $36 million reflecting strong growth infees from debt securities underwriting and higher levels of corporate financeactivity outside the United States.Trust, custody and investment management fees rose 15% to a record $338 millionin the 1997 third quarter and rose 10% to $969 million in the first nine monthsof 1997. These favorable results were largely attributable to growth in domesticand foreign assets under custody, expanded securities lending activity, and ahigher level of assets under management, including Chase's proprietary Vistamutual funds.(a) Represents fees for trustee, agency, registrar, securities lending, broker clearings, safekeeping and maintenance of securities.(b) Represents fees for trustee, estate services, custody, advisory and investment management.(c) Represents administrative, custody, trustee and other fees in connection with Chase's proprietary mutual funds. -20-  21Credit card revenue rose 10% in the 1997 third quarter and increased 12% for thefirst nine months of 1997, as a result of growth in managed outstandings,including the Wal-Mart co-branded product. The increases in revenue for both1997 periods was partially offset by a rise in net charge-offs on thesecuritized portfolio, which reduced the excess servicing fees Chase receivedfrom the securitizations. Average managed credit card receivables grew to $27.1billion in the third quarter of 1997, compared with $23.9 billion for the prioryear's third quarter. For a further discussion of the credit card portfolio andrelated securitization activity, see page 33 of this Form 10-Q.The higher levels of mortgage servicing fees for the 1997 periods reflect anincrease in mortgage servicing volume largely resulting from the acquisition ofthe portfolio of Source One Mortgage Services Corporation ("Source One") inFebruary 1997.Higher fees related to insurance products, brokerage commissions, investmentservices and cash management services contributed to the increase in other fees.TRADING REVENUE(a) Trading-related net interest income includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in the net interest income caption on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(b) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures, and forward rate agreements and related hedges.(c) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.(d) Includes U.S. and foreign government and government agency securities, corporate debt securities, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives, equity securities, equity derivatives, and commodity derivatives.Trading-related revenues of $678 million for the 1997 third quarter representsthe second consecutive record quarter, and are 43% above last year's thirdquarter results. Revenues from foreign exchange, emerging market activities andderivatives were particularly strong during the 1997 third quarter. -21-  22The increase in revenue from interest rate contracts was primarily due to highervolume as a result of volatility exhibited in the overseas markets, inparticular, Europe and Asia. The rise in foreign exchange revenue reflectedstrong earnings across a broad spectrum of currencies. This was the result ofrecent volatility in the Asian markets and an increase in cross-currency tradingactivity in the European markets caused by uncertainty as to the integration ofthe European Monetary System. Debt instruments and other revenue remained athigh levels, primarily as a result of strong performances in both emergingmarkets in Latin America and Eastern Europe and the U.S. securities business.Also contributing to the debt instruments and other category is growth inspecialty derivative products.Trading revenues are affected by many factors, including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by Chase onbehalf of its customers, Chase's success in proprietary positioning, the creditstanding of Chase, and the steps taken by central banks and governments whichaffect financial markets. Chase expects its trading revenues will fluctuate asthese factors will vary from period to period. On November 13, 1997, Chaseannounced that total trading revenues (including trading-related net interestincome) for the month of October amounted to a loss of approximately $160million before tax. The loss was the result of unusually volatile andadverse trading markets in the latter part of October, characterized by sharpdeclines and a loss of liquidity for certain securities, particularly emergingmarkets securities. See "Market Developments Since September 30, 1997".OTHER NONINTEREST REVENUESecurities gains resulted from sales from the available-for-sale portfolio madein connection with Chase's asset/liability management activities. The highergains in 1997 were primarily the result of sales of U.S. Government and agencysecurities in the 1997 third and second quarters and sales of securitiesoverseas in the 1997 first quarter.Revenue from equity-related investments includes income from domestic andinternational venture capital activities. The 1997 third quarter results of $243million were a record for Chase and were significantly higher than the prioryear's quarter and the quarterly average of approximately $180 million for theprevious eight quarters. During the 1997 third quarter, gains in Chase'sportfolio reflected market conditions which continued to favor corporate mergersand small-cap stocks. For the first nine months of 1997, revenue fromequity-related investments was $586 million, an increase of 6% compared with1996. At September 30, 1997, the carrying value of Chase's equity-relatedinvestments approximated $3.2 billion. Chase believes that equity-relatedinvestments will continue to make contributions to its earnings although thetiming of the recognition of gains is unpredictable and revenues could varysignificantly from period to period.Other revenue declined $9 million in the 1997 third quarter, but rose $232million for the first nine months, when compared with the prior year's periods.The 1997 results included higher residential mortgage origination and salesrevenue resulting from favorable secondary market conditions and higher gains onportfolio sales.All other revenue also includes Chase's investment in CIT Group Holdings, Inc.("CIT"), which contributed revenue of $16 million in the third quarter and $48million for the first nine months of 1997, compared with $12 million and $37million in the respective 1996 periods. -22-  23NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense, excluding restructuring costs, was $2,590 million in the1997 third quarter, an increase of 13% from the prior year's quarter, and was$7,407 million for the first nine months of 1997, an increase of 5% from thesame 1996 period. The 1997 results for both periods included investment spendingon new product offerings and technology, higher incentive costs and theaccelerated vesting of stock based incentive awards. Partially offsetting theseexpenses were incremental merger savings of $130 million and $520 million,respectively, in the 1997 third quarter and first nine months.For the 1997 third quarter and first nine months, underlying operatingnoninterest expense growth was 14% and 10%, respectively (see Glossary of Termson page 47). Management believes that underlying operating noninterest expense growth for the full year of 1997 will exceed 6% due to investment spending intargeted growth businesses.SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITSThe increase in salaries for the 1997 third quarter and first nine months wasprimarily due to higher incentive costs as a result of higher earnings,particularly trading results, investments in a number of growth businesses, aswell as competitive market pressures across many segments of the GlobalWholesale franchise. Also, the increase in salaries for both 1997 periodsreflected the accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards which resultedin a charge of $85 million in the 1997 third quarter and $50 million in the 1997first quarter.The following table presents Chase's full-time equivalent employees.The slight increase in full-time equivalent employees since December 31, andSeptember 30, 1996 reflects planned growth in selected businesses.Employee benefits were down slightly in the 1997 third quarter, and decreased$94 million for the nine month period. Included in the results for 1996 was a$40 million charge related to conforming retirement benefits provided to foreignemployees. Contributing to the decline in employee benefits during 1997 was lower pension expense. -23-  24OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSEOccupancy expense in the 1997 third quarter and first nine months decreased by$10 million and $58 million, respectively. These decreases were largely a resultof the consolidation of operations and branch facilities from merger integrationefforts. The higher level of equipment expense was primarily the result ofincreased software expenses to enhance processing systems throughout Chase, andtechnology expenditures necessary to support targeted growth businesses.RESTRUCTURING COSTSIn connection with the merger of The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("heritageChase") and Chemical Banking Corporation ("heritage Chemical"), $1.9 billion ofone-time merger-related costs were identified, of which $1.65 billion was takenas a restructuring charge on March 31, 1996. The remaining merger-relatedexpenses originally estimated at $250 million did not qualify for immediaterecognition under an existing accounting pronouncement and were not included inthe $1.65 billion charge. Merger-related expenses of $71 million were incurredin the third quarter 1997, resulting in cumulative-to-date merger-relatedexpenses of $336 million.Chase currently expects that merger-related expenses will rise by $100 millionto $125 million from its previous estimate of $250 million. These additionalcosts primarily relate to technology and systems integration costs.At September 30, 1997, the reserve balance associated with the $1.65 billionmerger-related restructuring charge was approximately $550 million, themajority of which is related to the disposition of certain facilities, premisesand equipment. OTHER EXPENSEOther expense for the 1997 third quarter and first nine months increased by $48million and $113 million, respectively. The increase includes expenses relatedto marketing and other costs for the co-branding of the Wal-Mart MasterCardwhich began in the fourth quarter of 1996. Also contributing to the increase inmarketing expense is the promotion of PC Banking, and Better Banking productsand services. In addition, there is approximately $11 million per quarter ofminority interest expense associated with the REIT, which commenced in the 1996fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these increases were lowertelecommunications expenses for both 1997 periods, due to Chase's sourcing andother expense-reduction initiatives.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $576 million in the third quarter of1997, compared with $527 million in the third quarter of 1996. For the firstnine months, Chase recorded income tax expense of $1,687 million in 1997,compared with $837 million in 1996. The 1996 amount includes tax benefitsrelated to the restructuring charge as well as aggregate tax benefits andrefunds of $132 million. Chase's effective tax rate was 37.0% for the thirdquarter and 37.3% for the first nine months of 1997, compared with 38.0%(excluding the aforementioned tax benefits and refunds) for both 1996 periods. -24-  25LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSChase is managed using an economic-based risk-adjusted management informationsystem ("MIS"). Chase's businesses are organized into two major businessfranchises, Global Wholesale Banking and Regional and Nationwide ConsumerBanking ("RNCB"). Within each of these franchises, key businesses are measuredindependently on a profit and loss and rate of return basis, as well as by otherkey performance measures. Highlights of key business performance measuresfollow, reflecting MIS results.LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS(a) Total column includes Corporate results. See description of Corporate on page 30.(b) Nonrecurring items for 1996 include the loss on the sale of a building in Japan, costs incurred in combining Chase's foreign retirement plans and aggregate tax benefits and refunds. -25-  26GLOBAL WHOLESALE BANKINGGlobal Wholesale Banking provides financing, advisory, sales and trading, tradefinance, asset management, private banking and operating services.

Through its Global Wholesale Banking businesses, Chase isdriving towards a new model for the delivery of global financial services,integrating product expertise, industry knowledge and geographic reach to effectsuperior customer solutions. Global Wholesale Banking operates in more than 50countries, including major operations in all key international financialcenters. Terminal Businesses, representing discontinued portfolios (primarilythe remaining refinancing country debt and commercial real estate problem assetand nonperforming portfolios), are also included in Global Wholesale Banking.Global Wholesale Banking's operating net income for the third quarter of 1997was $736 million, an increase of $245 million over the 1996 third quarter.Operating return on equity in the third quarter of 1997 was 28.7% compared with19.3% in 1996. Global Wholesale Banking's operating net income of $2,078 millionand operating return on equity of 28.1% for the first nine months of 1997increased from last year's results of $1,656 million and 21.8%, respectively.These favorable results were due to significant revenue growththroughout Chase's wholesale businesses, primarily higher trading-relatedrevenue due to increases in foreign exchange and interest rate activities,strong growth in specialty derivative products and continued high levels ofsecurities trading and underwriting.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within Global Wholesale Banking for the periods indicated. -26-  27GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING AND CORPORATE LENDINGGlobal Investment Banking and Corporate Lending finances and advisescorporations, financial sponsors and governments by providing integratedone-stop financial solutions and industry expertise to clients globally.

Net income for the third quarter of 1997 was $177 million,relatively flat when compared to the third quarter of 1996 reflecting highercorporate finance and syndication fees due to market share gains in high-yieldunderwriting and higher levels of corporate finance activities outside theUnited States. These increases were offset by the favorable impact of a largetransaction gain during the 1996 third quarter. For the first nine months of1997, net income of $491 million decreased $44 million compared with the sameperiod in 1996 due to a decline in net interest income coupled with thefavorable impact on the 1996 nine month results of several large transactions.GLOBAL MARKETSGlobal Markets' activities encompass the trading and sales of foreign exchange,derivatives, fixed income securities and commodities, including relatedorigination functions. A leader in capital markets, Chase operates 24 hours aday covering the major international cross-border financial markets, as well asmany local markets in both developed and developing countries. Global Markets isa recognized world leader in such key activities as foreign exchange, interestrate swaps and emerging markets debt. The strong growth in trading-relatedrevenue contributed to the favorable 1997 results. For the third quarter of1997, net income was $287 million with a return on common equity of 45%,compared with 1996's third quarter results of $217 million and 38%,respectively. For the first nine months of 1997, net income was $898 millionwith a return on common equity of 53% representing a substantial increase fromthe first nine months results of 1996 of $595 million and 34%, respectively.Trading-related revenue of $638 million for the 1997 third quarter reflectedrecord trading results and is an increase of 30% from last year's third quarterresults. These results reflect the benefits during the first nine months of1997 of increasing demand and a positive trading environment. For the firstnine months of 1997, trading-related revenue was $1,868 million, an increase of27% from last year's results driven by higher foreign exchange, derivatives, andsecurities results worldwide. Also, included within Global Markets are thedomestic and international treasury units which have the primary responsibilityof managing Chase's asset/liability and investment securities activities. ALMactivities in the treasury units are managed on a total return basis with oneof the major objectives being the creation of economic value over time. Thegross total return from ALM activities for the 1997 third quarter was $134million and for the first nine months of 1997 was $557 million.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERSChase Capital Partners ("CCP") is a global private equity organization withapproximately $4.6 billion under management, including $3.2 billion inequity-related investments.

Net income for the third quarter of 1997 was $123million, a $90 million increase from the 1996 third quarter, reflectingsignificant equity-related gains as market conditions continued to favorcorporate mergers and small-cap stocks. For the first nine months of 1997, netincome was $292 million, an $8 million decrease from last year's nine monthresults, reflecting a lower number of large transaction gains in 1997 whencompared with the same period in 1996.GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE BANKINGThe Global Asset Management and Private Banking group serves a global clientbase of wealthy individuals, institutional investors and mutual fund investors.Services include asset management for institutional investors, Vista MutualFunds (at September 30, 1997, the fourth largest bank-managed fund family in theU.S.), and a full range of private banking capabilities, including investmentmanagement, trust and estates, custody, and advisory services for wealthyindividuals around the world. Total assets under management amounted to $152billion at September 30, 1997.

Return on commonequity for the 1997 third quarter was 42% and for the first nine months of 1997,it was 33%; excluding the impact of goodwill, the return on tangible commonequity was 56% and 44%, respectively. These favorable results are due to strongrevenue growth primarily in global investor services and global trust,reflecting an increase in assets under custody and new business initiatives, aswell as continued productivity gains. -27-  28REGIONAL AND NATIONWIDE CONSUMER BANKING (RNCB)The Regional and Nationwide Consumer Banking franchise, as of September 30,1997, included the fourth-largest bank credit card issuer in the U.S., thethird-largest originator and the second-largest servicer of residentialmortgages and a leading provider of auto financing and other consumer lendingproducts.

For the first nine months of1997, RNCB's operating net income was $1,054 million, a $35 million increasewhen compared with last year's results. The favorable impacts from higherrevenue (which was driven by higher loan volume in credit cards and mortgagebanking products) and from the benefit of merger-related savings were partiallyoffset by higher credit provisions for credit cards and auto loans and higherexpenses related to marketing initiatives and new product offerings.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within RNCB for the periods indicated. (a) Insurance products are managed within Retail Payments and Investments but are included for reporting purposes in Credit Cards, Mortgage Banking, and National Consumer Finance.

Earnings for thefirst nine months of 1997 were driven by a 14% revenue increase generated fromgrowth in both the core portfolio and from co-branded initiatives and theeffects of higher fees and risk-based pricing initiatives. However, net incomedeclined as a result of higher credit card charge-offs and expenses related tothe launch of the Wal-Mart co-branded credit card.RETAIL PAYMENTS & INVESTMENTSAt September 30, 1997, Retail Payments and Investments has the leading share ofprimary bank relationships among consumers and small businesses in the New Yorkmetropolitan tri-state area. In addition to its tri-state businesses, RetailPayments and Investments includes discount brokerage services and Chase'snationwide insurance and investment products. Retail Payments and Investmentsallows customers to choose the way they handle their financial relationships,offering telephone, PC and Internet banking in addition to branches and ATMs.Net income in the third quarter of 1997 was $82 million, an increase of $14million when compared to 1996's third quarter. For the first nine months, netincome was $241 million in 1997, an increase of $29 million from 1996. Theimprovement in net income is due primarily to lower noninterest expense,reflecting staff reductions and branch consolidations, coupled with the impactof higher deposit volumes and higher fees from insurance products.MIDDLE MARKETChase is the premier provider of financial services to middle-market companies(companies with sales ranging from $10 to $500 million) regionally, with anational focus in selected industries. Also, it is the market leader in the NewYork metropolitan tri-state area where it has relationships with 53% of middlemarket companies and is the lead bank for 25% of such companies. Net income forthe 1997 third quarter was $52 million, a $6 million increase when compared withthe 1996 third quarter, due primarily to higher corporate finance fees. For thefirst nine months of 1997, net income was $162 million, a 14% increase from lastyear's nine month results, due to higher deposit volume and staff reductions.MORTGAGE BANKINGAt September 30, 1997, Mortgage Banking is the third-largest originator andsecond largest servicer of residential mortgage loans in the U.S., serving morethan 1.8 million customers nationwide. In 1997, Chase completed the acquisitionof Source One's $17 billion portfolio of mortgage servicing rights and atSeptember 30, 1997, Chase's servicing portfolio totaled $166.2 billion. In thefirst nine months of 1997, $25.0 billion in loans were originated. Net income inthe third quarter of 1997 was $51 million, a $16 million increase from the 1996third quarter. The increase is attributable to higher gains from mortgagewarehouse and sub-prime loan sales and from an increase in origination fees. Forthe first nine months of 1997, net income was $143 million, a $59 millionincrease from last year's nine month results, reflecting a 15% increase inrevenue. The increase is the result of a higher level of servicing assets, anincrease in net interest income due to loan growth, and a 6% decrease inexpenses due to merger saves and the productivity gains resulting from thereengineering of the mortgage origination business. Return on common equity forthe 1997 third quarter is 19% and for the first nine months of 1997 is 16%;however, excluding the impact of goodwill, the return on tangible common equityis 28% and 23% for both periods, respectively.NATIONAL CONSUMER FINANCENational Consumer Finance is a leading provider of auto financing, home equitysecured lending, student lending, unsecured consumer lending (Chase AdvantageCredit) and manufactured housing financing. At September 30, 1997, Chase AutoFinance had $11.6 billion in outstandings with $7.5 billion in new originationsfor the first nine months of 1997. Net income in the third quarter of 1997 was$32 million which was flat when compared with the 1996 third quarter. For thefirst nine months of 1997, net income was $87 million, a $14 million decreasefrom last year's nine month results. The results for both periods in 1997include revenue growth due to an increase in loan volume, which was offset by ahigher credit provision. The growth in revenue for the first nine months of 1997when compared to the same 1996 period, was partially offset by the impact of ajoint venture formed with Sallie Mae in the 1996 fourth quarter, which isaccounted for on the equity basis. Excluding the effects of this joint venture,year-to-date revenue grew by 16%.INTERNATIONAL CONSUMERInternational Consumer provides loan, deposit, investment and insurance productsfor individuals in Hong Kong. Also, included is The Manhattan Card CompanyLimited (Chase's 54% owned subsidiary) which is the third-largest credit cardissuer in Hong Kong. Additionally, Chase has a leading full-service bankingpresence in Panama and the Eastern Caribbean, providing deposit, investment andasset products for individuals, small businesses, large corporations andgovernment entities. Net income for the third quarter of 1997 is $12 million andfor the first nine months of 1997 is $41 million, which is a $3 million decreasein both periods when compared to the same 1996 periods. The 1997 nine monthresults were driven by a 4% growth in revenue, reflecting higher loan volumes,offset by higher expenses, primarily due to investment spending, and highercredit costs. -29-  30TEXAS COMMERCETexas Commerce is the primary bank for more large corporations and middle marketcompanies than any other bank in Texas. Texas Commerce also maintains a strongconsumer banking presence through its 125 locations. Additionally, TexasCommerce was the largest bank for personal and corporate trust services in theSouthwest. As of September 30, 1997, Texas Commerce had $22.5 billion in totalassets. Net income for the third quarter of 1997 was $84 million, a $12 millionincrease when compared with the 1996 third quarter. For the first nine months of1997, net income was $222 million, an $18 million increase from last year's ninemonth results. Texas Commerce continues to produce solid revenue growth,reflecting an increase in fee-based activities and higher loan and depositvolumes. This is partially offset by higher expenses and credit costs. Return oncommon equity for the 1997 third quarter is 23% and for the first nine months of1997 is 20%; however, excluding the impact of goodwill, the return on tangiblecommon equity is 29% and 26%, respectively.CORPORATECorporate includes the management results attributed to Chase's investment inCIT and some effects remaining at the Corporate level after the implementationof management accounting policies, including residual credit provision and taxexpense. The securitized portion of the credit card portfolio is included inCorporate. Corporate also includes one-time unallocated special items such asmerger-related restructuring charges and expenses as well as tax refunds. Forthe third quarter of 1997, Corporate had an operating net loss of $96 millioncompared with operating net income of $40 million in the 1996 third quarter. Forthe first nine months of 1997, Corporate had an operating net loss of $190million compared to a $60 million operating net loss in the first nine months of1996. Included in the 1997 results were $135 million of expenses related to theaccelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards ($85 million after-tax).Chase's economic risk-based methodology for capital is allocated on a businessunit level basis for credit, market and operating risk, with the unallocatedportion of capital included in Corporate. In 1997, Corporate had unallocatedequity of $2,538 million in the third quarter and $2,462 million in the firstnine months, compared with $1,827 million in the 1996 third quarter and $1,691million in the first nine months of 1996. The increases in unallocated capitalreflects the continued improvement of the overall risk profile of Chase and thegeneration of retained earnings.Lines-of-business results are subject to restatement as appropriate wheneverthere are refinements in management reporting policies or changes to themanagement organization. The current presentation of the lines-of-businessresults have been restated to reflect a single, uniform post-merger set ofmanagement accounting policies.Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred by thebusinesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating shareholders'equity and the provision for credit losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology.Also, incorporated in the guidelines is a process for matching assets andliabilities with similar maturity, liquidity and interest characteristics withineach business. Noninterest expenses of Chase are fully allocated to the businessunits except for special corporate one-time charges. The provision for creditlosses is allocated to the wholesale bank and commercial businesses based on aconsistently applied credit risk methodology and a risk-grading systemappropriate for a business unit's portfolio. For the retail consumer businesses,provision for credit losses are assigned utilizing a net charge-off methodology.Long-term expected tax rates are assigned in evaluating Chase's businesses.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1996 and should be read in conjunction withpages 48-54 of Chase's 1996 Annual Report. A description of Chase's accountingpolicies for its nonperforming assets is provided in Note One of Chase's 1996Annual Report.LOAN PORTFOLIOChase's loans outstanding totaled $163.1 billion at September 30, 1997, comparedwith $155.1 billion at the 1996 year-end. The increase reflects higher demandfor consumer and commercial loans, partially offset by the impact of creditcard, auto loan, residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.Chase's nonperforming assets at September 30, 1997 were $1,036 million, adecrease of $115 million from the 1996 year-end level. The reduction reflectsthe ongoing improvement in Chase's credit profile as a result of a lower levelof loans being placed on nonperforming status, repayments, charge-offs, andcontinuing loan workout and collection activities.Total net charge-offs were $190 million in the third quarter of 1997, comparedwith $220 million for the comparable period in 1996. For the first nine months,net charge-offs were $599 million in 1997, compared with $715 million in 1996.The amount for the first nine months of 1996 excludes a charge of $102 millionrelated to conforming the credit card charge-off policies of the two predecessorbanks. Total net charge-offs (on a managed basis, which excludes the impact ofcredit card securitizations) were $436 million in the 1997 third quarter,compared with $364 million in the third quarter of 1996. For the first ninemonths, total net charge-offs (on a managed basis) were $1,315 million in 1997,compared with $1,098 million in 1996 (excluding the aforementioned charge of$102 million). The increases in managed net charge-offs for both 1997 periodsreflect growth in average managed credit card outstandings and higher levels ofpersonal bankruptcies and delinquencies. -30-  31The following table presents Chase's loan-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Consists of 1-4 family residential mortgages.(b) Consists of installment loans (direct and indirect types of consumer finance), student loans and unsecured revolving lines of credit. There are essentially no credit losses in the student loan portfolio due to the existence of Federal and State government agency guarantees. Student loans which were past due 90 days and over and still accruing were approximately $38 million and $54 million at September 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996, respectively.(c) Represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans secured by mortgages on 1-4 family residential properties. -31-  32DOMESTIC CONSUMER PORTFOLIOResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $38.7 billion atSeptember 30, 1997, reflecting a $2.1 billion increase during 1997 largely dueto a higher level of adjustable-rate loan outstandings. At September 30, 1997,nonperforming domestic residential mortgage loans as a percentage of theportfolio was 0.84%, compared with 0.68% at the 1996 year-end.The following table presents the residential mortgage servicing portfolioactivity for the periods indicated. A discussion of Chase's mortgage servicingand loan origination activities is included on pages 49-50 of Chase's 1996Annual Report.(a)Represents acquisition of Source One servicing portfolio in February 1997.Mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), which are included in other assets, amountedto $1,861 million at September 30, 1997, compared with $1,404 million atDecember 31, 1996. The higher level of MSRs reflects the corresponding increasein Chase's residential mortgage servicing portfolio partly due to theacquisition of the Source One servicing portfolio. The Source One acquisitionadded $246 million of MSRs at September 30, 1997. Chase continually evaluatesprepayment exposure of the servicing portfolio, adjusting the balance andremaining life of the servicing rights as a result of prepayments, and utilizesderivative contracts (interest rate swaps and purchased option contracts) toreduce its exposure to such prepayment risks. At September 30, 1997, thecarrying value of these derivative contracts was $113 million, and grossunrecognized gains and losses were $51 million and $35 million, respectively,resulting in an estimated positive fair value of $129 million.Credit Card Loans: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a "managedbasis", which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well ascredit card receivables that have been securitized. During the third quarter of1997, Chase securitized $2.0 billion of credit card receivables. No credit cardreceivables were securitized during the third quarter of 1996. During the firstnine months of 1997, Chase securitized $3.4 billion of credit card receivables,compared with $5.8 billion in the same 1996 period. For the third quarter of1997, average managed receivables were $27.1 billion, compared with $23.9billion in the 1996 third quarter, reflecting the continued growth in creditcard outstandings. -32-  33The following table presents credit-related information for Chase's managedcredit card receivables.(a) Excludes charge related to conforming the credit card charge-off policies ofheritage Chase and heritage Chemical.The increase in net charge-offs on managed credit card receivables for both thethree-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 1997, when compared withthe same 1996 periods, reflects growth in average managed credit cardoutstandings and higher levels of personal bankruptcies and delinquencies. Netcharge-offs for the 1997 third quarter have decreased when compared with the1997 second quarter. This decrease is due to the slight improvement in thelevels of personal bankruptcies and delinquencies during the 1997 third quarter.Management currently believes that credit card net charge-offs peaked in thesecond quarter of 1997. Additionally, management expects that Chase's creditcard net charge-offs, as a percentage of average managed credit cardreceivables, will be approximately 5.6% to 5.7% for the full year 1997.During October 1997 Chase agreed to purchase substantially all of The Bank of New York's credit card portfolio, totaling approximately 3.5 million accountsand approximately $4.0 billion in outstandings. The acquisition is expected to be completed by year-end 1997.Credit Card Securitizations: For a discussion of Chase's credit cardsecuritizations, see page 51 of Chase's 1996 Annual Report.The following table outlines the impact of the securitizations of credit cardreceivables by showing the favorable (unfavorable) change in the reportedConsolidated Statement of Income line items for the periods indicated.The pre-tax loss on securitizations for both 1997 periods is due to the impactof upfront losses arising at the time of the securitizations in 1997 (as aresult of the implementation of SFAS 125), which will be subsequently recoveredas higher credit card revenue over the life of the securitizations. In addition,the amortization of gains from prior years' securitizations reduced the 1997pre-tax amounts. Credit card securitizations have no net pre-tax impact onChase's income statement over the life of a securitization. Therefore, theamounts in the above table reflect the timing of gain/loss recognitionassociated with these securitizations.Auto Financings: The auto financing portfolio, which consists of auto loans andleases, was $13.4 billion at September 30, 1997 and $11.1 billion at December31, 1996. The increase reflected continued strong consumer demand due tofavorable pricing programs, partially offset by the impact of auto loansecuritizations. Total originations were $8.2 billion in the first nine monthsof 1997, compared with $9.3 billion in the same 1996 period. Chase securitizedapproximately $2.1 billion of auto loans during the first nine months of 1997,compared with $3.0 billion during the first nine months of 1996. Net charge-offsrelated to auto financings were $15 million in the 1997 third quarter, comparedwith $11 million in the same period in 1996. For the first nine months, netcharge-offs of auto financings were $42 million in 1997, compared with $25million in 1996. The increased level of net charge-offs related to autofinancings in both 1997 periods primarily reflects growth in the portfolio andunfavorable performance in a discontinued product line. -33-  34Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans, which includes student loans,unsecured revolving lines of credit, and secured installment loans, decreased by$.9 billion at September 30, 1997. This decrease was due to the sale ofrecreational vehicle and marine loan portfolios in the 1997 third quarter. Theincrease in net charge-offs for the 1997 first nine months reflects higherpersonal bankruptcies related to unsecured revolving lines of credit.DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIODomestic Commercial and Industrial Portfolio: The domestic commercial andindustrial portfolio totaled $38.8 billion at September 30, 1997, an increasefrom $34.7 billion at December 31, 1996. The portfolio consists primarily ofloans made to large corporate and middle market customers and is broadlydiversified geographically and by industry.Nonperforming domestic commercial and industrial loans were $308 million atSeptember 30, 1997, compared with $444 million at December 31, 1996. In thethird quarter of 1997, Chase had net charge-offs of $15 million compared withnet recoveries of $4 million in the third quarter of 1996. For the first ninemonths, net charge-offs were $33 million in 1997 compared with $90 million in1996.Management expects commercial and industrial loan net charge-offs for full-year1997 to be equal to or lower than the 1996 full-year level, primarily as aresult of the continued strong performance in the commercial and industrialloan portfolio.Domestic Commercial Real Estate Portfolio: The domestic commercial real estateportfolio represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loanssecured by one-to-four family residential properties (which are included in theconsumer loan portfolio). The domestic commercial real estate loan portfoliototaled $6.6 billion at September 30, 1997, an increase of 10% from December 31,1996, reflecting increased loan originations during the 1997 third quarter. Asubstantial portion of the loans originated during the 1997 third quarter are inthe process of being syndicated or securitized.The table below sets forth the major components of the domestic commercial realestate loan portfolio.Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate loans were $119 million atSeptember 30, 1997, a $37 million decrease from the December 31, 1996 level.Domestic Financial Institutions Portfolio: The domestic financial institutionsportfolio includes loans to commercial banks and companies whose businessesprimarily involve lending, financing, investing, underwriting, or insurance.Loans to domestic financial institutions were $5.1 billion, or 3% of total loansoutstanding, at September 30, 1997, compared with $5.5 billion at December 31,1996. The portfolio continued to maintain its strong credit quality during thefirst nine months of 1997.FOREIGN PORTFOLIOForeign portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, loans to financialinstitutions, commercial real estate, loans to foreign governments and officialinstitutions, and consumer loans. At September 30, 1997, Chase's total foreignloans were $40.6 billion, compared with $39.8 billion at December 31, 1996. Theportfolio included foreign commercial and industrial loans of $25.5 billion atSeptember 30, 1997, an increase of $2.3 billion from the 1996 year-end.Foreign nonperforming loans at September 30, 1997 were $146 million, an $11million increase from December 31, 1996. Net recoveries of foreign loans were $7million in the 1997 third quarter, compared with net charge-offs of $8 millionin the 1996 third quarter. For the first nine months, foreign loan netrecoveries were $5 million in 1997, compared with net recoveries of $19 millionin 1996.INDUSTRY DIVERSIFICATIONBased upon the industry classifications utilized by Chase at September 30, 1997,there were no industry segments which exceeded 5% of total Commercial andIndustrial loans outstanding. -34-  35DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the normal course of its business, Chase utilizes various derivative andforeign exchange financial instruments to meet the financial needs of itscustomers, to generate revenues through its trading activities, and to manageits exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates. For a discussion ofthe derivative and foreign exchange financial instruments utilized in connectionwith Chase's trading activities and asset/liability management activities,including the notional amounts and credit exposure outstandings as well as thecredit and market risks involved, see Notes 3 and 9 of this Form 10-Q and pages52-58 and Notes One and Seventeen of Chase's 1996 Annual Report.Many of Chase's derivative and foreign exchange contracts are short-term, whichmitigates credit risk as transactions settle quickly. The following tableprovides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreign exchange contractsoutstanding at September 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996. Percentages are basedupon remaining contract life of mark-to-market exposure amounts. Mark-to-marketexposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the value of a derivative orforeign exchange contract in the open market.Chase routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchange transactions withregulated financial institutions, which Chase believes have relatively lowcredit risk. At September 30, 1997, approximately 86% of the mark-to-marketexposure of these transactions was with commercial bank and financialinstitution counterparties, most of which are dealers in these products.Nonfinancial institutions accounted for approximately 14% of Chase's derivativeand foreign exchange mark-to-market exposure. Additionally, at September 30,1997 and December 31, 1996, nonperforming derivatives contracts were immaterial.Chase does not deal, to any significant extent, in derivatives, which dealers ofderivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions) consider to be"leveraged". As a result, the mark-to-market exposure as well as the notionalamount of such derivatives were insignificant at September 30, 1997. -35-  36ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses is available to absorb potential credit lossesfrom the entire loan portfolio, as well as derivative and foreign exchangecontracts, letters of credit, guarantees and undrawn legal commitments. As ofSeptember 30, 1997, the allowance for credit losses has been allocated intothree components: a $3,462 million allowance for loan losses, which is reportednet in Loans; a $75 million allowance for credit losses on derivative andforeign exchange financial instruments, which is reported net in TradingAssets-Risk Management Instruments; and a $170 million allowance for creditlosses on letters of credit, guarantees, and undrawn legal commitments, which isreported in Other Liabilities. During the first nine months of 1997, there wereno provisions or charge-offs made to the latter two components. However, therewas a transfer of $100 million from the allowance for loan losses to theallowance for credit losses on letters of credit, guarantees and undrawn legalcommitments during the 1997 second quarter as a result of the inclusion in theevaluation of the allowance of undrawn legal commitments. The 1996 amounts havenot been reclassified due to immateriality.Chase deems its allowance for credit losses at September 30, 1997 to be adequate(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that may currently exist in the portfolio,but are not yet identifiable). Estimating potential future losses is inherentlyuncertain and depends on many factors, including general macroeconomic andpolitical conditions, rating migration, structural changes within industrieswhich alter competitive positions, event risk, unexpected correlations withinthe portfolio, and other external factors such as legal and regulatoryrequirements. Chase periodically reviews such factors and reassesses theadequacy of the allowance for credit losses.The accompanying table reflects the activity in Chase's allowance for loanlosses for the periods indicated.The following table presents Chase's allowance for loan losses coverage ratios. -36-  37MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1996 and should be read in conjunction withpages 54-58 and Notes One and Seventeen of Chase's 1996 Annual Report.TRADING ACTIVITIESMeasuring Market Risk: Market risk is measured and monitored on a daily basisthrough a value-at-risk ("VAR") methodology, which captures the potentialovernight dollar loss from adverse market movements. The quantification ofmarket risk through a VAR methodology requires a number of key assumptionsincluding confidence level for losses, number of days of price history, holdingperiod, measurement of inter-business correlation, and the treatment of risksoutside the VAR methodology, such as event risk and liquidity risk. [GRAPHIC OF DAILY MARKET RISK-RELATED REVENUES]The preceding chart contains a histogram of Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue. Market risk-related revenue is defined as the daily change in value inmarked-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest incomeor other revenue. Net interest income related to funding and investment activityis excluded. Based on actual trading results for the twelve months endedSeptember 30, 1997, which captures the historical correlation among businessunits, 95% of the variation in Chase's daily trading results fell within a $30million band centered on the daily average amount of $11 million. For the twelvemonths ended September 30, 1997, Chase posted positive daily market risk-relatedrevenue for 244 out of 259 business trading days for international and domesticunits. For 228 of the 259 days, Chase's daily market risk-related revenue orlosses occurred within the negative $5 million through positive $20 millionrange, which is representative of Chase's emphasis on market-making, sales andarbitrage activities. In the latter part of October, trading markets becamedifficult and unusually volatile. There were sharp declines and a loss ofliquidity for certain securities, particularly emerging markets securities.During the period from October 1, 1997 through October 31, 1997, there were 6 days with negative market risk-related revenue, including 5 days wherethe daily loss exceeded $10 million. See "Market Developments Since September30, 1997".ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIESChase's interest rate risk profile is generally managed with consideration forboth total return and reported earnings. Interest rate risk arises from avariety of factors, including differences in the timing between the contractualmaturity or repricing (the "repricing") of Chase's assets and liabilities andderivative financial instruments, as the repricing characteristics of its loansand other assets do not necessarily match those of its deposits, otherborrowings and capital. Chase, as part of its ALM process, employs a variety ofcash (primarily securities) and derivative instruments in managing its exposureto fluctuations in market interest rates.Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity:In managing exposure, Chase uses quantifications of net gap exposure, andearnings and valuation sensitivity measures. An example of aggregate net gapanalysis is presented below. Assets, liabilities and derivative instruments areplaced in gap intervals based on their repricing dates. Assets and liabilitiesfor which no specific contractual repricing or maturity dates exist or whosecontractual maturities do not reflect their expected maturities are placed ingap intervals based on management's judgment and statistical analysis concerningtheir most likely repricing behaviors.A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilitiesrepricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negative gap - moreliabilities repricing than assets - will benefit net interest income in adeclining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income ina rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positive gap - more assetsrepricing than liabilities - will benefit net interest income if rates arerising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment. -37-  38CONDENSED INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY TABLEAt September 30, 1997, Chase had $11,840 million more liabilities than assetsrepricing within one year (including the net repricing effects of derivativepositions). This compares with $7,945 million more liabilities than assetsrepricing within one year, or 2% of total assets, at December 31, 1996.As of September 30, 1997, Chase's earnings at risk to an immediate 100 basispoint rise in interest rates is estimated to be approximately 2.5% of Chase'sprojected after-tax net income for the next twelve months. An immediate 100basis point rise in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario, used tomeasure risk, and does not necessarily represent management's current view offuture market developments. At December 31, 1996, Chase's earnings at risk to asimilar increase in market rates was estimated to be approximately 3.5% ofprojected 1997 after-tax net income.Interest Rate Swaps: Interest rate swaps are one of the various financialinstruments used in Chase's ALM activities. The following table summarizes theoutstanding ALM interest rate swap notional amounts at September 30, 1997, bytwelve-month intervals (i.e., October 1, 1997 through September 30, 1998). Thedecrease in notional amounts from one period to the next period representsmaturities of the underlying contracts. The weighted-average fixed interestrates to be received and paid on such swaps are presented for each twelve-monthinterval. The three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), provided forreference in the following table, reflects the average implied forward yieldcurve for that index as of September 30, 1997. However, actual repricings willbe based on the applicable rates in effect at the actual repricing date. To theextent rates change, the variable rates paid or received will change. Chaseexpects the impact of any interest rate changes on these swaps to be largelymitigated by corresponding changes in the interest rates and values associatedwith the linked assets and liabilities. -38-  39OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND RECEIVE/PAY RATES BY YEARLYINTERVALSThe following table summarizes Chase's assets and liabilities at September 30,1997, with the notional amount of related derivatives used for ALM purposes.(a) At September 30, 1997, notional amounts of approximately $4 billion for interest rate swaps, which are used in place of cash market instruments, have been excluded from the above table. See Note One of the 1996 Annual Report for a discussion of Chase's accounting policy relative to derivatives used in place of cash market instruments.(b) Includes futures, forwards, forward rate agreements and options. -39-  40The unfavorable impact on net interest income from Chase's ALM derivativeactivities was $79 million in the third quarter and $128 million for the firstnine months of 1997, compared with an unfavorable impact of $20 million for thethird quarter and $55 million for the first nine months of 1996. Chase also hasderivatives that affect noninterest revenue (such as derivatives linked tomortgage servicing rights).The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's ALM activities at September 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996.The net deferred losses at September 30, 1997 are expected to be amortized asyield adjustments in net interest income or noninterest revenue, as applicable,over the periods reflected in the following table. Chase also uses selectedderivative financial instruments to manage the sensitivity to changes in marketinterest rates on anticipated transactions; however, such transactions are notsignificant. Accordingly, at September 30, 1997, deferred gains and lossesassociated with these transactions were not material.Included in the table above are gross unrecognized losses from daily marginsettlements on open futures contracts, which were $3 million at September 30,1997. The net unrecognized losses shown above do not include the net favorableimpact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.For a further discussion, see Note 11 on page 15.The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes unamortized premiums on open ALM optioncontracts which will be amortized as a reduction to net interest income ornoninterest revenue over the periods indicated in the following table.AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED GAINS (LOSSES) ON CLOSED ALM CONTRACTS ANDOF PREMIUMS ON OPEN ALM OPTION CONTRACTS -40-  41OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENTChase, like all large financial institutions, is exposed to many types ofoperating risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders,unauthorized transactions by employees, and errors relating to computer andtelecommunications systems. Chase maintains a system of controls that isdesigned to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of the financialstrength of Chase, the characteristics of the businesses and markets in whichChase operates, competitive circumstances and regulatory considerations.However, from time to time in the past, Chase has suffered losses from operatingrisk and there can be no assurance that Chase will not suffer such losses in thefuture.CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 58-59 and NoteSixteen of Chase's 1996 Annual Report.CAPITALDuring the 1997 third quarter, Chase elected early adoption of the FederalReserve Board's new guidelines for the risk-based capital standards, whichincorporate a measure for market risk consistent with the principles adopted bythe Basle Committee on Banking Supervision under the Basle Capital Accord. Thenew guidelines require banks and bank holding companies that have significantmarket risk exposure to measure that risk utilizing a value-at-risk model, basedon the parameters contained in the guidelines, and to maintain a commensurateamount of capital. In addition, the assets and off-balance sheet financialinstruments, and related capital, of Chase's securities subsidiary, ChaseSecurities Inc., are now included in the calculation of these ratios, while theprovisions of SFAS 115 continue to be excluded. Prior periods have not beenrestated.Chase's level of capital at September 30, 1997 remained well in excess ofregulatory guidelines. At September 30, 1997, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratioswere 7.83% and 11.63%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.03%.Chase is committed to maintaining a disciplined capital policy. As part of thispolicy, Chase intends to maintain its capital at levels that will allow it tosupport its growth and make investments, including acquisitions in its corebusinesses. It has also, as part of this policy, targeted a Tier 1 Capital ratioof 8% to 8.25%.During the first nine months of 1997, the total capitalization of Chase (the sumof Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) increased by $2.8 billion to $32.2 billion. Theincrease was primarily due to the inclusion of Chase Securities Inc., asmentioned above, and the issuance of $790 million of capital securities (net ofdiscount) by certain Chase subsidiaries (See Note 7 of this Form 10-Q).Partially offsetting these amounts was the redemption of $910 million ofpreferred stock.In October 1996, Chase announced a common stock purchase program. The programauthorizes Chase to purchase through December 31, 1998 up to $2.5 billion of itscommon stock, plus such amount of its common stock as may be necessary toprovide for expected issuances under Chase's dividend reinvestment plans and itsvarious stock-based director and employee benefit plans. From inception throughSeptember 30, 1997, Chase repurchased 31.4 million common shares ($3.1 billion)and reissued from treasury approximately 11.3 million common shares ($1.0billion) under its benefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of 20.1 millioncommon shares ($2.1 billion). Management currently intends to complete itsstock buy-back program in early 1998.In the first quarter of 1997, Chase raised the cash dividend on its common stockto $.62 per share, from $.56 per share. Management currently expects thatChase's dividend policy will generally be to pay a common stock dividend equalto approximately 25% to 35% of Chase's net income (excluding restructuringcharges) less preferred stock dividends. Chase's future dividend policies willbe determined by its Board of Directors, taking into consideration Chase'searnings and financial condition and applicable governmental regulations andpolicies. -41-  42The following table sets forth the components of capital for Chase.COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL(a) Minority interest includes the Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in Corporation's Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures and the Preferred Stock of the REIT Subsidiary. For a further discussion, see Note 7 of this Form 10-Q.(b) Includes off-balance sheet risk-weighted assets in the amount of $94,899 million and $79,099 million, respectively, at September 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996.LIQUIDITYChase is an active participant in the capital markets. It raises funds from timeto time through the issuance of commercial paper, medium-term notes, long-termdebt, and common and preferred stock. At September 30, 1997, Chase's long-termdebt was $13,899 million. Chase issued $2,635 million of long-term debt duringthe first nine months of 1997; during the same period, $1,181 million oflong-term debt matured and $265 million was redeemed. Chase constantly evaluatesthe opportunities to redeem its outstanding debt and preferred stock in light ofcurrent market conditions. -42-  43SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 2-5 of Chase's 1996 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $2.3 billion atSeptember 30, 1997.In addition to the dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations,the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") have authority under theFinancial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment ofdividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Chase and itssubsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the bankingregulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsoundpractice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.FDICIAThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")required the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC depositinsurance. FDICIA also contained provisions limiting certain activities andbusiness methods of depository institutions. Finally, FDICIA provided forexpanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, includingparent holding companies, by such institutions' appropriate Federal bankingregulator. Each of Chase's banking institutions were "well capitalized" as thatterm is defined under the various regulations promulgated under FDICIA.Therefore, Chase does not expect such regulations to have a material adverseimpact on its business operations.ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTSDERIVATIVE AND MARKET RISK DISCLOSURESThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued a Release in January 1997 thatwill require Chase, commencing with the Annual Report for the year endedDecember 31, 1997, to supplement in certain respects its current disclosuresrelating to derivatives and certain other financial instruments. Chase expectsits 1997 Annual Report will conform to the new disclosure requirements.REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEIn June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 130. SFAS 130 will become effective forfinancial statements beginning in the first quarter of 1998. SFAS 130 definesthe concept of "comprehensive income" and establishes the standards forreporting "comprehensive income". Comprehensive income is defined to include netincome, as currently reported, as well as unrealized gains and losses inavailable-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments andcertain other items not included in the income statement. SFAS 130 also setsforth requirements on how comprehensive income should be presented as part of anissuer's financial statements. Chase is currently assessing how it will disclosecomprehensive income in its financial statements. The adoption of SFAS 130 willnot affect Chase's earnings, liquidity or capital resources.SEGMENTSIn June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 131. SFAS 131 will become effective forfinancial statements for the year ended 1998. SFAS 131 defines the criteria bywhich an issuer is to determine the number and nature of its "operatingsegments" and sets forth the financial information that is required to bedisclosed about such operating segments. Chase is currently assessing the mannerin which it will disclose the required information. -43-  44 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the three months ended September 30, 1997 and September 30, 1996, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.37% and 6.30%, respectively.(c) For the three months ended September 30, 1997 and September 30, 1996, the negative impact from nonperforming loans on net interest income was $16 million and $9 million, respectively.(d) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -44-  45 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the nine months ended September 30, 1997 and September 30, 1996, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.65% and 6.46%, respectively.(c) For the nine months ended September 30, 1997 and September 30, 1996, the negative impact from nonperforming loans on net interest income was $51 million and $58 million, respectively.(d) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -45-  46 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) -46-  47 GLOSSARY OF TERMSThe page numbers included after each definition below represents the pages inthe MD&A and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements where the term isprimarily used.Asset/Liability Management ("ALM"): The management and control of thesensitivity of Chase's income to changes in market interest rates.
