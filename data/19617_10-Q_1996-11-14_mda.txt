Part 1Item 2 (continued)On March 31, 1996, The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("Chase") merged with andinto Chemical Banking Corporation ("Chemical"). Upon consummation of the merger,Chemical changed its name to "The Chase Manhattan Corporation" (the"Corporation"). The merger was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and,accordingly, the information included in this Form 10-Q presents the combinedresults of Chase and Chemical as if the merger had been in effect for allperiods presented. Certain forward-looking statements contained herein aresubject to risks and uncertainties. The Corporation's actual results followingthe merger may differ materially from those set forth in such forward-lookingstatements. Reference is made to the Corporation's reports filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, in particular the Form 8-K dated July 17,1996, the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June30, 1996 and the Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders (as filed with theCorporation's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 16, 1996) for a discussionof factors that may cause such differences to occur.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chase Manhattan Corporation (the "Corporation") reported earnings for thethird quarter of 1996 were $858 million, a 12% increase when compared with 1995third quarter earnings of $764 million. Primary earnings per share ("primaryEPS") were $1.80 for the 1996 third quarter, compared with $1.58 for the 1995third quarter, and fully diluted earnings per share ("fully diluted EPS") forthe 1996 and 1995 third quarters were $1.78 and $1.55, respectively.Excluding merger-related expenses of $20 million, after tax, net income for the1996 third quarter was $878 million, primary EPS were $1.85 and fully dilutedEPS were $1.83.The Corporation's net income, including restructuring charges and expenses of$1,060 million, after tax, was $1,625 million for the first nine months of 1996,compared with $2,132 million for the first nine months of 1995. Primary EPS andfully diluted EPS for the first nine months of 1996 were $3.28 and $3.23,respectively, compared with $4.47 and $4.30, respectively, for the same periodsin 1995. Excluding restructuring charges and expenses, the Corporation'searnings for the first nine months of 1996 rose 25% to $2,685 million. Primaryand fully diluted EPS were $5.66 and $5.57, respectively, in 1996, compared with$4.51 and $4.34, respectively, in the same 1995 period.The Corporation's third quarter and first nine months 1996 results reflectedrevenue growth in its global wholesale and nationwide consumer businesses, andeffective management of its operating and credit costs. Merger savings were $180million in the 1996 third quarter and $320 million for the first nine months of1996. Management expects to achieve its previously announced performance targetof $510 million of merger-related savings for 1996.The Corporation's return on average common stockholders' equity was 17.9% forthe third quarter of 1996, compared with 16.2% for the 1995 comparable quarter.Excluding restructuring charges and expenses, the return on common stockholders'equity was 19.0% for the first nine months of 1996 versus 15.9% for the sameperiod of 1995. The Corporation's efficiency ratio improved to 58.2% for thethird quarter of 1996, compared with 61.9% for the third quarter of 1995.Excluding the impact of credit card securitizations (see further discussions onpages 33 and 34), the efficiency ratio for the third quarters of 1996 and 1995was 56.1% and 61.1%, respectively.In connection with reporting the Corporation's 1996 third quarter earnings,management announced that it believed that the Corporation will generally meetpreviously announced operating goals for 1996. Management of the Corporationcurrently expects the Corporation to continue to realize annual operatingrevenue growth, on a managed basis, of 5-7% into 1997, and continues to targetas financial goals double digit operating earnings per share growth in each ofthe next two years, a return on average common equity of 18% or higher by 1998,and an efficiency ratio in the low 50% range by 1998.On October 15, 1996, the Corporation announced that its Board of Directors hadauthorized a common stock repurchase program for the Corporation. TheCorporation is authorized until December 31, 1998 to purchase up to $2.5 billionof its common stock, in addition to such other number of common shares as may benecessary to provide for expected issuances under its dividend reinvestment planand its various stock-based director and employee benefits plans.At September 30, 1996, the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratioswere 8.36% and 12.17%, respectively (excluding the assets and off-balance sheetfinancial instruments of the Corporation's securities subsidiary, as well as theCorporation's investment in this subsidiary). These risk-based capital ratioswere well in excess of the minimum ratios specified by the Board of Governors ofthe Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board") and at September 30, 1996,the Corporation and all of its depository institutions were "well capitalized"as defined by the Federal Reserve Board.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at September 30, 1996 were $1,517million, a decline of $147 million compared with $1,664 million on December 31,1995, and $369 million from $1,886 million at September 30, 1995. Nonperformingassets have declined by approximately $10.0 billion, or 87%, from their peaklevel of $11.5 billion in 1991. -17- - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL REVENUEThe Corporation's total revenue for the 1996 third quarter was $3,925 million,an increase of 4% from the same 1995 period. For the first nine months of 1996,total revenue increased 7% to $11,914 million from the comparable 1995 period.On a managed basis, which excludes the impact of credit card securitizations,total revenue for the 1996 third quarter increased 6% to $4,074 million and forthe 1996 nine months increased 10% to $12,325 million.NET INTEREST INCOMEReported net interest income for the 1996 and 1995 third quarter was unchangedat $2,069 million. For the first nine months, reported net interest income was$6,258 million (including $54 million of interest related to Federal and Statetax audit settlements) in 1996, $134 million higher than the comparable periodin 1995. Excluding the impact of securitizations and the tax audit settlements,net interest income on a managed basis increased 7% in the 1996 third quarterand 8% for the first nine months, reflecting growth in consumer receivables (ona managed basis) and higher levels of trading-related assets.Excluding the impact of credit card securitizations and the tax auditsettlements, the net yield was 3.36% in the 1996 third quarter, a decline of 8basis points from the prior year quarter, and 3.42% for the first nine months of1996, a decline of 6 basis points when compared with the same prior-year period.The decline in both 1996 periods was due to an increase in lower-yieldingsecurities and trading-related assets. -18- The following table reflects the composition of interest-earning assets as apercentage of total earning assets for the periods indicated.Average interest-earning assets increased during the third quarter and ninemonth periods in 1996, when compared with the respective 1995 periods,principally as a result of increases in liquid interest-earning assets and theavailable-for-sale securities portfolio. The Corporation has continued toincrease its liquid interest-earning assets through its trading and Section 20activities. The Corporation increased its securities portfolio in both 1996periods as part of its asset/liability management activities. Additionally, theCorporation's average total loans in the 1996 third quarter were stable whencompared with the third quarter of 1995, but increased by $4.1 billion in the1996 nine month period when compared with the comparable nine month 1995 period.The increase reflected growth in consumer loans (despite the impact of a higherlevel of credit card securitizations) and, to a lesser extent, commerciallending, partially offset by the continued reduction in the commercial realestate portfolio.The growth in interest-earning assets in the 1996 third quarter was funded by a$14.9 billion increase in interest-bearing liabilities. The increase ininterest-bearing liabilities was principally due to a higher level of Federalfunds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, partiallyoffset by a decline in total interest-bearing deposits. The Corporation utilizesrepurchase agreements as a source of short-term funding for trading-relatedpositions and for its securities portfolio.For additional information on average balances and net interest income on ataxable equivalent basis, see Average Consolidated Balance Sheet, Interest andRates on pages 46 and 47.Management anticipates that, given its current expectations for interest ratemovements for the remainder of 1996, the Corporation's net interest income for1996 will be higher than net interest income for 1995 (prior to the impact ofcredit card securitizations). -19- PROVISION FOR LOSSESThe Corporation's provision for losses was $220 million for the 1996 thirdquarter, compared with $250 million in the 1996 second quarter, and $192 millionin the 1995 third quarter. For the first nine months, the provision for losseswas $715 million in 1996, compared with $572 million in 1995. The increase inthe provision for losses for both 1996 periods, when compared with thesame 1995 periods, was primarily the result of higher commercial netcharge-offs as a result of a lower level of recoveries. For the same periods,the Corporation had lower consumer net charge-offs due, in part, to a decline inthe level of credit card receivables retained on the balance sheet.Management anticipates that the provision for losses in 1997 will be modestlyhigher than in 1996, primarily as a result of an anticipated further decline inrecoveries in the commercial portfolio and anticipated growth in assets,particularly in the Corporation's national consumer receivables. For adiscussion of the Corporation's net charge-offs, see the Credit Risk ManagementSection on pages 31-37.NONINTEREST REVENUENoninterest revenue increased for the 1996 third quarter and nine-month periodwhen compared with the corresponding 1995 periods reflecting increases in feesand commissions principally from corporate finance and syndication activities,credit card revenue and trust and investment management fees. The Corporationcontinued to generate fee growth by offering clients integrated solutions andproducts. New product offerings such as advisory services have been integratedwith other products and services of the Corporation, contributing to theCorporation's fee growth. The 1996 third quarter increases in fees andcommissions were partially offset by lower trading revenue. While the 1996 ninemonth results reflected increased fees and commissions and a 38% increase intrading revenue, these increases were partially offset by lower other revenuewhich included a loss of $60 million on the sale of a building in Japan.Additionally, the 1995 nine month period included a gain of $85 million on thesale of the Corporation's investment in Far East Bank and Trust Company.The following table presents the components of noninterest revenue for theperiods indicated.FEES AND COMMISSIONSCorporate finance and syndication fees were $234 million in the 1996 thirdquarter, an increase of 11% from the prior-year period. For the first ninemonths of 1996, such fees rose 24% from the comparable period a year ago. Theincreases from both 1995 periods were the result of strong loan syndication,securities underwriting related to the high-yield business and advisoryactivities. During the first nine months of 1996, the Corporation acted as agentor co-agent for approximately $353 billion of syndicated credit facilities, areflection of the Corporation's large client base and strong emphasis ondistribution.Trust and investment management fees rose 14% in the 1996 third quarter and 19%for the 1996 first nine months, reflecting increased global services andsecurities processing activities, growth in the Vista mutual funds and highertrust fees attributable to growth in assets under management. Also contributingto the increases were higher fees due to the acquisition of the securitiesprocessing businesses of U.S. Trust Corporation ("US Trust") in September 1995,which contributed approximately $27 million of revenue in the 1996 third quarterand $75 million for the first nine months of 1996.Credit card revenue increased $67 million, or 32%, for the 1996 third quarterand $155 million, or 26%, for the 1996 first nine months as a result of anincrease in securitization volume as well as growth in managed outstandings andactive accounts. The higher level of securitizations accounted for $50 millionof the increase in credit card revenue in the 1996 third quarter and $105million of the increase in the first nine months of 1996. Average managed creditcard receivables (credit card receivables on the balance sheet plus securitizedcredit card receivables) grew to $23.9 billion for the third quarter of 1996,compared with $21.6 billion for the prior-year's comparable period. For afurther discussion of the credit card portfolio and related securitizationactivity, see pages 33-34 of this Form 10-Q. -20- The following table sets forth the components of fees for other financialservices for the periods indicated.Fees related to automobile securitizations and brokerage commissions contributedto the increase in other fees, reflecting the impact of automobilesecuritizations in late 1995 and early 1996, as well as higher transactionvolume and a larger customer base at the Corporation's discount brokerage firm,Brown and Company.Trading RevenueThe following table sets forth the components of trading revenue for the thirdquarter and first nine months of 1996 and 1995.The increase in revenue from interest rate contracts during the 1996 first ninemonths was primarily due to anticipated volatility in certain Western European,Asian and U.S. interest rate markets, as well as higher customer demand forderivatives used for risk management purposes. The declines in foreign exchangerevenue in the 1996 third quarter and first nine months were caused by severalfactors, prominent among them the decrease in the level of cross-currencytrading activity in the European markets in anticipation of the integration ofthe European Monetary System. The increases in debt instrument revenue duringthe 1996 third quarter and first nine months were primarily the result of strongperformances in emerging markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Inaddition, the 1995 nine-month results had been adversely affected by majordeclines in the prices of emerging markets debt instruments during the earlypart of 1995. -21- Trading revenues are affected by many factors, including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by theCorporation on behalf of its customers, the Corporation's success in proprietarypositioning, the credit standing of the Corporation, and the steps taken bycentral banks and governments which affect financial markets. The Corporationexpects its trading revenues will fluctuate as these factors will vary fromperiod to period.OTHER NONINTEREST REVENUEThe following table presents securities gains and the composition of otherrevenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 1996 and 1995.All securities sales were from the available-for-sale portfolio. For a furtherdiscussion of the Corporation's securities, see Note 5 of the Notes to FinancialStatements.Revenue from equity-related investments, which includes income from venturecapital activities and emerging markets investments, was $112 million in the1996 third quarter, $6 million higher than the comparable 1995 quarter. For thefirst nine months of 1996, revenue from equity-related investments was $554million, an increase of 12% from 1995, reflecting the continuing benefits of abroad-based portfolio of investments in an active market. At September 30, 1996,the Corporation had equity-related investments with a carrying value ofapproximately $2.7 billion. The Corporation believes that equity-relatedinvestments will continue to make contributions to the Corporation's earnings(averaging approximately $160 million per quarter for the previous eightquarters), although the timing of the recognition of gains from these activitiesis unpredictable and revenues from such activities could vary significantly fromperiod to period.Residential mortgage origination/sales activities declined $71 million for thefirst nine months of 1996, when compared with the 1995 periods reflecting theimpact of gains from the sale of servicing rights during 1995.The increases in all other revenue in the 1996 third quarter and first ninemonths were primarily due to gains on the sale of various nonstrategic assets.These gains were partially offset by lower income of $9 million in the 1996third quarter and $23 million in the first nine months of 1996 from theCorporation's investment in CIT, as a result of the sale of half of theCorporation's investment in CIT in December 1995. -22- NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense, before restructuring charges and expenses, was $2,288million in the 1996 third quarter, a decline of $44 million from the thirdquarter of 1995. The decrease reflects merger-related expense savings of $180million, primarily reflecting lower salaries and benefits related to personnelreductions and other merger integration efforts. This was partially offset byhigher incentive costs related to strong revenue growth.For the first nine months, noninterest expense excluding restructuring chargesand expenses, foreclosed property expense and a $40 million charge to conformretirement benefits provided to foreign employees, decreased by approximately$69 million from the same 1995 period. The decline is primarily due to mergerintegration efforts and lower FDIC expenses. The results for the first ninemonths of 1996 include noninterest expenses relating to the U.S. Trustprocessing business which was acquired in September 1995, and reflect theabsence of expenses relating to the southern and central New Jersey bankingoperations which were sold in the fourth quarter of 1995.Noninterest expense for the full year 1996 is expected to be approximately $100million higher than the previously targeted $9.1 billion, primarily as a resultof higher incentive costs in line with higher than expected revenue growth. Theincrease in this expense does not include additional expenses (approximately $40million) related to the introduction of the Corporation's co-branded Wal-MartMasterCard, and expenses (approximately $10 million) associated with preferredstock dividends issued by a newly organized real estate investment trustsubsidiary of the Corporation.SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITSThe decrease in salaries for the 1996 third quarter reflects the favorableimpact of approximately 7,300 reductions in full-time equivalent employees sinceSeptember 30, 1995 as a result of the merger and the aforementioned sale of thesouthern and central New Jersey banking operations. The $84 million increase insalaries for the first nine months was primarily due to higher incentive costsas a result of stronger earnings for most businesses. Also contributing to theincrease in salaries was the vesting in the first quarter of 1996 of certainstock-based incentive awards due to the improvement in the Corporation's stockprice, the continued investment in the Corporation's securities underwritingbusiness and the additional staff costs resulting from the U.S. Trust processingbusiness acquisition in September 1995. -23- The following table presents the Corporation's full-time equivalent employees atthe dates indicated.The increase in employee benefits in the first nine months of 1996 was primarilythe result of a $40 million charge (relating to conforming retirement benefitsprovided to foreign employees) and expenses associated with a newly consolidatedforeign investment. Also impacting employee benefits was an increase in socialsecurity expenses associated with the exercise of options granted underbroad-based employee plans and the vesting of certain stock-based incentiveawards in the first quarter of 1996.OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSEOccupancy expense in the 1996 third quarter and first nine months decreased by$23 million and $41 million, respectively, largely as a result of theconsolidation of operations and branch facilities from a pre-merger expenseinitiative program as well as a result of merger integration efforts.For the first nine months of 1996, the $24 million decline in equipment expensewas primarily the result of expense reduction initiatives relating to softwarecosts and equipment rentals.FORECLOSED PROPERTY EXPENSEFor the first nine months, foreclosed property expense was a credit of $15 million in 1996, compared with a credit of $60 million in 1995 due to lower gains on the sale of foreclosed properties.RESTRUCTURING CHARGEIn connection with the merger, $1.9 billion of one-time merger-related costshave been identified, of which $1.65 billion was taken as a restructuring chargeon March 31, 1996. In addition, merger-related expenses of $32 million and $60million were incurred in the 1996 third quarter and first nine months,respectively, and were included in the restructuring charge and expenses captionon the income statement. For a further discussion of the restructuring charge,see Note 2 on page 8. Because of the inherent uncertainties associated withmerging two large corporations, there can be no assurance that the $1.9 billionof merger-related costs will reflect the actual costs ultimately incurred by theCorporation in implementing the merger or that the Corporation would not deem itappropriate to take additional charges, as the merger implementation processcontinues.OTHER EXPENSEThe following table presents the components of other expense for the periodsindicated. -24- All other expenses increased by $27 million in the 1996 third quarter. Theincrease primarily reflected the consolidation of a foreign investment andhigher travel and other incidental costs related to services provided byemployees involved with merger integration efforts. FDIC assessments for the1996 third quarter reflected a special assessment for Savings AssociationInsurance Fund-related deposits.For the first nine months of 1996, other expense decreased $96 million, or 5%,from the 1995 comparable period. The improvement reflected a $48 million declinein marketing expense as a result of expense reduction initiatives and lower FDICassessments of $99 million (which resulted from the elimination of FDICassessments other than with respect to deposits associated with the acquisitionof former savings and loan branches). Partially offsetting these declines wereincreases in other expenses during the first nine months of 1996, as discussedabove.INCOME TAXESThe Corporation recognized income tax expense of $527 million in the thirdquarter of 1996, compared with $491 million in the third quarter of 1995. Forthe first nine months, the Corporation recorded income tax expense of $837million in 1996, compared with $1,376 million in 1995. The 1996 nine-monthamount includes tax benefits related to the restructuring charge and aggregatetax benefits and refunds of $132 million. The Corporation's effective tax rates,for both periods in 1996 and 1995 (excluding the aforementioned tax benefits andrefunds), were 38% and 39%, respectively.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Profitability of the Corporation is tracked with an internal managementinformation system that produces lines-of-business performance. The currentpresentation of lines-of-business results is based on uniform managementaccounting policies. Lines-of-business results are subject to restatement asappropriate whenever there are refinements in management reporting policies orchanges to the management organization.Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred by thebusinesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating shareholders'equity and the provision for losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology. Alsoincorporated in the guidelines is a process for matching assets and liabilitieswith similar maturity, liquidity and interest characteristics within eachbusiness. Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to thebusiness units except for special corporate one-time charges. Management hasdeveloped a risk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different types ofrisk -- credit, market, and operating/business -- within various businesses andassigns capital accordingly. A long-term expected tax rate is assigned inevaluating the Corporation's businesses. -25-  -26- Part 1Item 2 (continued) -27-
