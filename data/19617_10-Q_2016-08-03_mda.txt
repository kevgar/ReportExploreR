>Note 4&#32;&#8211; Fair value option For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note&#32;4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following&#32;tables presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2016&#32;and 2015, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.&#32;99100Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of&#32;June 30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.&#32;At&#32;June 30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was&#32;$4.7 billion&#32;and $4.6 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of&#32;$(95) million&#32;and $(94) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note&#32;29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report, and Note 21&#32;of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe table below presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk type.101Note 5&#32;&#8211; Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of&#32;the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note&#32;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The Firm's disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of&#32;the Firm's derivatives are designated in hedge &nbsp;accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in&#32;the Firm's market-making businesses or for other purposes.&#32;The following table outlines&#32;the Firm's primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.&#32;102Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of&#32;the Firm's derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in&#32;the Firm's view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.&#32;103Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on&#32;the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.&#32;104Derivatives netting&#32;The following tables present, as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where&#32;the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.&#32;In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables,&#32;the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with&#32;the Firm's derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:&#32;105106Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features&#32;For a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to&#32;the Firm's derivative contracts, see Note&#32;6 of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral&#32;the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.&nbsp;The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of&#32;JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), at June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.&#32;Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset&#32;In certain instances&#32;the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer.&#160;The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note&#32;12, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at&#32;June 30, 2016 was not material.&#32;107Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of incomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.&#32;Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.&#32;108Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.&#32;The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income.&#32;The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the&#32;three and six months ended June 30, 2016.&#32;In the first quarter of 2015, the Firm reclassified approximately&#32;$150 million&#32;of net losses from AOCI to other income because&#32;the Firm determined that it was probable that the forecasted interest payment cash flows would not occur as a result of the planned reduction in wholesale non-operating deposits.&#32;&nbsp;Over the next 12 months,&#32;the Firm expects that approximately&#32;$212 million&#32;(after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately&#32;7 years. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately&#32;2 years. The Firm's longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.&#32;109Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following&#32;table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2016 and 2015.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&nbsp;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note&#32;6&#32;for information on principal transactions revenue.&#32;110Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note&#32;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in&#32;the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.&#32;Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings and maturity profile, and the total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, where&#32;JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where&#32;JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.&#32;111Note 6&#32;&#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for&#32;the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note&#32;7 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.&#32;The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of&#32;the Firm's client-driven market-making activities.&#160;See Note&#32;7&#32;for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.&#32;The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.&#32;&nbsp;The following table presents the components of firmwide asset management, administration and commissions. Other incomeOther income on&#32;the Firm's Consolidated statements of income included the following:&#32;112Note 7&#32;&#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note&#32;8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.113Note 8&#32;&#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's pension and OPEB plans, see Note&#32;9 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $15.9 billion&#32;and $3.6 billion, as of June 30, 2016, and $16.0 billion&#32;and $3.5 billion&#32;respectively, as of December 31, 2015. See Note 19&#32;for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net (gain)/loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016&#32;and 2015.&nbsp;The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2016&#32;at this time. For 2016, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $33 million. The 2016&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $47 million&#32;and $2 million, respectively. 114Note 9&#32;&#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note&#32;10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following&#32;noncash compensation expense related to&#32;its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income.In the first quarter of 2016, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2015 performance year,&#32;the Firm granted&#32;33 million&#32;RSUs and&#32;926 thousand&#32;PSUs,&#32;all with a weighted-average grant date fair value of&#32;$57.24.PSU AwardsIn January 2016,&#32;the Firm's Board of Directors approved the grant of PSUs to members of&#32;the Firm's Operating Committee under the variable compensation program for performance year 2015. PSUs are subject to&#32;the Firm's achievement of specified performance criteria over a&#32;three-year period. The number of awards that vest can range from&#32;zero&#32;to 150%&#32;of the grant amount. The awards vest and are converted into shares of common stock in the quarter after the end of the&#32;three-year performance period. In addition, dividends will be notionally reinvested in&#32;the Firm's common stock and will be delivered only in respect of any earned shares.&#32;Once the PSUs have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional&#32;two-year&#32;period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of&#32;five&#32;years from the grant date.&#32;&nbsp;Note 10&#32;&#8211; Noninterest expenseFor details on noninterest expense, see Consolidated statements of income on&#32;page 81. Included within&#32;other expense are the following:115Note 11&#32;&#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as trading, AFS or HTM. Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note&#32;3. Predominantly all of&#32;the Firm's AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO within the investment securities portfolio in connection with&#32;the Firm's asset-liability management objectives. At&#32;June 30, 2016, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of&#32;AA+&#32;(based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note&#32;12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;During the second quarter of 2016, the Firm transferred commercial mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of&#32;$7.5 billion&#32;from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value.&#32;AOCI included net pretax unrealized gains of&#32;$78 million&#32;on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect&#32;the Firm's intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on AOCI. This transfer was a non-cash transaction.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.116Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at June 30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.117Gross unrealized losses The Firm has recognized unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell as other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;).&#32;The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of June 30, 2016, and it is not likely that&#32;the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income,&#32;the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss as of June 30, 2016, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.&#32;For additional information on other-than-temporary impairment, see Note&#32;12 of the JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and OTTI losses from AFS securities that were recognized in income.&#32;&nbsp;Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe cumulative credit loss component, including any changes therein, of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that&#32;the Firm does not intend to sell was not material as of and during the&#32;three and six&#32;month periods ended June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015.118Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.&#32;119derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.&#32;For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected,&#32;see Note 4. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements,&#32;see Note 22.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of&#32;the Firm's securities financing agreements as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and December 31, 2015. When&#32;the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,&#32;the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition,&#32;the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces, in&#32;the Firm's view, the economic exposure with&#32;the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as &#8220;Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,&#8221; and reduces the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; presented below, if&#32;the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.&#32;120The tables below present as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt June 30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm held $5.6 billion&#32;and $7.5 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated balance sheets.121Note 13&#32;&#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition.&#32;The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report. See Note&#32;4&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on&#32;the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note&#32;3&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by&#32;the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment&#32;the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.The following tables summarize&#32;the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.&#32;122The following&#32;tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated.&#32;These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that&#32;the Firm reduces its credit exposures.&#32;The following table provides information about gains and losses, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, on loan sales by portfolio segment.&#32;123Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.&#32;The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.124Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.&#32;125The following table represents&#32;the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.&nbsp;HELOCs beyond the revolving period and home equity loans HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period.&#32;That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those&#32;products is higher than the minimum payment options&#32;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into&#32;the Firm's allowance for loan losses.&#32;Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a&#32;TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.126The following&#32;tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by&#32;the Firm.Loan modificationsModifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;The following table presents new TDRs reported by&#32;the Firm.127Nature and extent of modificationsThe U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable programs, as well as&#32;the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following&#32;tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the above&#32;loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.128Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following&#32;tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under&#32;the above loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications. These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.&#32;At&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years&#32;for home equity and 10 years&#32;for residential mortgages.&#32;The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of&#32;$1.0 billion&#32;and $1.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.129Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.&#32;130Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.&#160;See Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.&#32;The following table provides information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2016&#32;and 2015.131Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.132Approximately&#32;23%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs.&#32;The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for&#32;the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015, and represents&#32;the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARMs and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of&#32;$1.9 billion&#32;and $2.3 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's credit card loans.Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.133The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&#32;At June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, $96 million&#32;and $113 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $55 million&#32;and $66 million&#32;at June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.&#32;Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for&#32;60&#32;months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs.&#160;New enrollments in these loan modification programs were&#32;$141 million&#32;and $151 million, for the&#32;three months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015, respectively, and $300 million&#32;and $329 million&#32;for the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.&#32;For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become&#32;two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with&#32;the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be&#32;27.62%&#32;and 25.61%&#32;as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.&#32;134Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned to each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note&#32;14 and Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.&#32;135The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans consist of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents&#32;the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.&nbsp;ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015.Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the&#32;tables above. TDRs were $355 million&#32;and $208 million&#32;as of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.136Note 14&#32;&#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and related informationThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.&#32;137Note 15&#32;&#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs, see Note 1 of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on&#32;page 141&#32;of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts, including its primary vehicle, the Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 142&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans&#32;(including student loans) primarily in its&#32;CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved,&#32;the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of&#32;the Firm's involvement with&#32;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.138The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in&#32;Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by&#32;the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances,&#32;the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on&#32;page 143&#32;of this Note for further information regarding&#32;the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and&#32;page 143&#32;of this Note for information on&#32;the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies.139Residential mortgageFor a more detailed description of&#32;the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.At June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain&#32;Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which&#32;the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that&#32;the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on&#32;page 142&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB&#32;originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of&#32;the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report. See the table on&#32;page 142&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase'sparticipation in certain re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.During the three months ended June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015, the Firm transferred $3.5 billion&#32;and $6.3 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $144 million&#32;and $255 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.During the six months ended June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015, the Firm transferred $6.4 billion&#32;and $10.2 billion, respectively, of securities to agency VIEs, and $144 million&#32;and $727 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $2.4 billion&#32;and $2.2 billion, respectively. At June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm held approximately $2.5 billion&#32;and $4.6 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities. The Firm's exposure to non-consolidated private-label re-securitization entities as of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015&#32;was not material. As of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm consolidated an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities of Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitizations.&nbsp;Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with&#32;Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.In the normal course of business,&#32;JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.&#32;The Firm held&#32;$19.1 billion&#32;and $15.7 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.&#32;The Firm's investments reflect&#32;the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.&#32;The Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded portion of these commitments was&#32;$9.0 billion&#32;and $5.6 billion&#32;at June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note&#32;21.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.140The Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, was as follows.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,&#32;remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where&#32;the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,&#32;the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.141Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by&#32;the Firm as of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans.&#32;For a&#32;further description of&#32;the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.142Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to&#32;the Firm's securitization activities for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015, related to assets held in&#32;JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by&#32;the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises , loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,&#32;the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises&#32;(&#8220;U.S. GSEs&#8221;). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans).&#32;The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.&#32;The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales,&#32;the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser.&#32;See Note 21&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report&#32;for additional information about&#32;the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note&#32;16&#32;for additional information about the impact of&#32;the Firm's sale of &nbsp;certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.143Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to&#32;the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note&#32;21, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements.&#32;The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When&#32;the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding &nbsp;liability. As of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated balance sheets&#32;$10.2 billion&#32;and $11.1 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which&#32;the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was&#32;$355 million&#32;and $343&#160;million&#32;as of June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note&#32;13&#32;of this Form 10-Q and Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.144Note 16&#32;&#8211; Goodwill and other intangible assetsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.&nbsp;Goodwill Impairment testingFor further description of the Firm's goodwill impairment testing process, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 274&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at June&#160;30, 2016, or December&#160;31, 2015, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;or 2015.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse estimates of the impact of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of&#32;the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.145Mortgage servicing rightsMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report&#32;and Note&#32;3&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the&#32;three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015.146The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016&#32;and 2015.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of&#32;the Firm's MSRs at&#32;June 30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which could either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.147Note 17&#32;&#8211; DepositsFor further discussion on deposits, see Note&#32;19 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.At&#32;June&#160;30, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.&nbsp;Note 18&#32;&#8211; Earnings per shareFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), see Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2016&#32;and 2015.148Note 19&#32;&#8211; Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to&#32;the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and DVA on fair value option elected liabilities.Effective January 1, 2016,&#32;the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected. This guidance requires the portion of the total change in fair value caused by changes in&#32;the Firm's own credit risk (DVA) to be presented separately in other comprehensive income; previously these amounts were recognized in net income. The guidance was required to be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to the Consolidated balance sheets, which resulted in a reclassification from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income.149The following table presents the pre-tax and after-tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss).150<hr
