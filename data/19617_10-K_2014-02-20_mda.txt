>Management's discussion and analysisThis section of JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report for the year ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;(&#8220;Annual Report&#8221;), provides Management's discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&A&#8221;) of the financial condition and results of operations of JPMorgan Chase. See the Glossary of Terms on pages 341&#8211;345&#32;for definitions of terms used throughout this Annual Report. The MD&A included in this Annual Report contains statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firm's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are described herein (see Forward-looking Statements on page 181&#32;of this Annual Report) and in JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;(&#8220;2013&#32;Form 10-K&#8221;), in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;1A: Risk factors; reference is hereby made to both.JPMorgan Chase & Co., a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), with operations worldwide; the Firm has $2.4 trillion&#32;in assets and $211.2 billion&#32;in stockholders' equity as of December&#160;31, 2013. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing, asset management and private equity. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the world's most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients.JPMorgan Chase's principal bank subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), a national bank with U.S. branches in 23&#32;states, and Chase Bank USA, National Association (&#8220;Chase Bank USA, N.A.&#8221;), a national bank that is the Firm's credit card&#8211;issuing bank.

For a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties, as well as the enterprise risks and critical accounting estimates affecting the Firm and its various lines of business, this Annual Report should be read in its entirety.Economic environment The global economy regained momentum in 2013, led by faster growth in the advanced economies, helped by decisive policy actions in the U.S., European Union, U.K., and Japan. Uncertainties about U.S. fiscal policy were reduced substantially by year-end, as were extreme downside risks to performance in the Eurozone and China that had been concerns earlier in the year. In addition, real consumer spending in the U.S. was supported late in the year by solid job growth, falling gasoline prices, and rising equity and house prices.The U.S. economic forecast for 2014 looks for a gradual acceleration in real sales growth and for inflation to remain well below the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee's long-run target of 2%. If the economic forecast for 2014 is realized, the tapering of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee will proceed and is expected to be completed before the end of 2014. However, the forecast does not look for a first rate hike by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee until sometime in 2015.The European Central Bank's (&#8220;ECB&#8221;) support in stabilizing European financial markets, along with the constructive steps taken by the European Union to lay the groundwork for a more coherent banking union, helped the region to return to growth during the first half of 2013. However, later in the year, the pace of the Eurozone's recovery remained slow, high unemployment tested the social and political stability of several of Europe's weaker economies, and Cyprus became the fourth country in the Eurozone to receive a full bail-out. While Germany and the northern European economies continued to drive growth, elsewhere in Europe growth was more subdued. More encouraging were signs that the peripheral economies in the region are showing signs of healing.Economic performance in Asia was mixed in 2013. Japan boomed; in contrast, activity decelerated across much of the rest of the region. Growth outcomes were also mixed across Latin America. Economic activity decelerated in Mexico. Brazil began 2013 with positive momentum but then lost significant steam, with a widening gap between projected growth outcomes and inflation indicators. Policy uncertainties, slowing China demand for commodities, credit overhangs, and elevated inflation all weighed on investment in many emerging countries.&nbsp;In summary, there is reason to be optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook in 2014. The economy finally appears to have broken out of the 2% range of growth experienced in the first several years of recovery, and the extent of both fiscal policy restraint and fiscal policy uncertainty should be sharply reduced. While growth in emerging markets is expected to remain subdued, economic activity is expected to continue accelerating in Europe.Summary of 2013 ResultsJPMorgan Chase reported full-year 2013 net income of $17.9 billion, or $4.35 per share, on net revenue of $96.6 billion. Net income decreased by $3.3 billion, or 16%, compared with net income of $21.3 billion, or $5.20 per share, in 2012. ROE for the year was 9%, compared with 11% for the prior year.The decrease in net income in 2013 was driven by a higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by higher legal expense. The reduction in the provision for credit losses reflected continued favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. The decline in the provision for credit losses reflected lower consumer and wholesale provisions as net charge-offs decreased and the related allowance for credit losses was reduced by $5.6 billion in 2013. The decline in the allowance reflected improved home prices in the residential real estate portfolios, as well as improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate, credit card loan and wholesale portfolios. Firmwide, net charge-offs were $5.8 billion for the year, down $3.3 billion, or 36%, from 2012, which included $800 million of incremental charge-offs related to regulatory guidance. Nonperforming assets at year-end were $9.7 billion, down $2.2 billion, or 18%. Total firmwide allowance for credit losses was $17.0 billion, resulting in a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.80%, excluding the purchased credit-impaired portfolio, compared with 2.43% in 2012.The Firm's results reflected strong underlying performance across its four major reportable business segments, with strong lending and deposit growth. Consumer & Business Banking within Consumer & Community Banking was #1 in deposit growth for the second year in a row and #1 in customer satisfaction among the largest banks for the second year in a row as measured by The American Customer Satisfaction Index (&#8220;ACSI&#8221;). In Card, Merchant Services & Auto, credit card sales volume (excluding Commercial Card) was up 10% for the year. The Corporate & Investment Bank maintained its #1 ranking in Global Investment Banking Fees and reported record assets under custody of $20.5 trillion at December 31, 2013. Commercial Banking loans increased to a record $137.1 billion, a 7% increase compared with the prior year. Asset Management achieved nineteen consecutive quarters of positive net long-term client flows into assets under management. Asset Management also increased loan balances to a record $95.4 billion at December 31, 2013. JPMorgan Chase ended the year with a Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 10.7%, compared with 11% at year-end 2012. The Firm estimated that its Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approach on a fully phased-in basis, based on the interim final rule issued in October 2013, was 9.5% as of December 31, 2013. Total deposits increased to $1.3 trillion, up 8% from the prior year. Total stockholders' equity at December 31, 2013, was $211.2 billion. (The Basel I and III Tier 1 common ratios are non-GAAP financial measures, which the Firm uses along with the other capital measures, to assess and monitor its capital position. For further discussion of the Tier 1 common capital ratios, see Regulatory capital on pages 161&#8211;165&#32;of this Annual Report.)During 2013, the Firm worked to help its customers, corporate clients and the communities in which it does business. The Firm provided credit to and raised capital of more than $2.1 trillion for its clients during 2013; this included $19 billion lent to small businesses and $79 billion to nonprofit and government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The Firm also originated more than 800,000 mortgages.The discussion that follows highlights the performance of each business segment compared with the prior year and presents results on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with the reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and, for each line of business and the Firm as a whole, includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue on a tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of each line of business, see pages 82&#8211;83&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;Consumer & Community Banking&#32;net income increased compared with the prior year due to lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense, predominantly offset by lower net revenue. Net interest income decreased, driven by lower deposit margins, lower loan balances due to net portfolio runoff and spread compression in Credit Card, largely offset by the impact of higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue decreased, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by higher card income. The provision for credit losses was $335 million compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $5.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $5.8 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $5.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $9.3 billion, including $800 million of incremental charge-offs related to regulatory guidance. Noninterest expense decreased compared with the prior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing expense, partially offset by investments in Chase Private Client expansion, higher non-MBS related legal expense in Mortgage Production, higher auto lease depreciation and costs related to the control agenda.Corporate & Investment Bank&#32;net income increased by 2% compared with the prior year. Net revenue included a $1.5 billion loss from the implementation of a funding valuation adjustment (&#8220;FVA&#8221;) framework for over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives and structured notes in the fourth quarter, and a $452 million loss from debit valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on structured notes and derivative liabilities. The prior year net revenue included a $930 million loss from DVA. Banking revenue increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher lending and investment banking fees revenue, partially offset by Treasury Services revenue which was down slightly from the prior year.&#160;Lending revenue increased driven by gains on securities received from restructured loans.&#160;Investment banking fees revenue increased compared with the prior year driven by higher equity and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by lower advisory fees. Excluding FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA, Markets and Investor Services revenue increased compared with the prior year. The provision for credit losses was a lower benefit reflecting lower recoveries compared with the prior year. Noninterest expense was slightly down from the prior year primarily driven by lower compensation expense.Commercial Banking&#32;net income was slightly lower for 2013 compared with the prior year, reflecting higher noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue. Net interest income increased, driven by growth in loan balances and the proceeds from a lending-related workout, partially offset by lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments. Noninterest expense increased, primarily reflecting higher product- and headcount-related expense.Management's discussion and analysisAsset Management&#32;net income increased in 2013, driven by higher net revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense. Net revenue increased, driven by net client inflows, the effect of higher market levels and net interest income resulting from higher loan and deposit balances. Noninterest expense increased, driven by higher headcount related expenses, higher performance-based compensation and costs related to the control agenda.Corporate/Private Equity&#32;reported a higher net loss compared with the prior year driven by higher noninterest expense partially offset by higher net revenue. Noninterest expense for 2013 included $10.2 billion in legal expenses compared with $3.7 billion in the prior year. The current year net revenue included a $1.3 billion gain from the sale of Visa shares and a $493 million gain from the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza. The prior year net revenue included losses from the synthetic credit portfolio in the CIO. Consent Orders and Settlements During the course of 2013, the Firm continued to make progress on its control, regulatory, and litigation agenda and put some significant issues behind it. In January 2013, the Firm entered into the Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to the Firm's Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls, and with respect to the risk management and control functions in the CIO, as well as with respect to its other trading activities. Other settlements during the year included the Consent Orders entered into in September 2013 concerning oversight of third parties, operational processes and control functions related to credit card collections litigation practices and to billing practices for credit monitoring products formerly offered by the Firm; the settlements in November 2013 of certain repurchase representation and warranty claims by a group of institutional investors and with the U.S. Department of Justice, several other federal agencies and several State Attorneys General relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securitization activities of the Firm, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; the Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into in January 2014 with the U.S. Department of Justice and related agreements with the OCC and FinCEN relating to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and the Firm's AML compliance programs; and the February 2014 settlement entered into with several federal government agencies relating to the Firm's participation in certain federal mortgage insurance programs.In addition to the payment of restitution and, in several instances, significant penalties, these Consent Orders and settlements require that the Firm modify or enhance its processes and controls with respect to, among other items, its mortgage foreclosure and servicing procedures, Anti-Money Laundering procedures, oversight of third parties, credit card litigation practices, and risk management, model governance, and other control functions related to the CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm. The Firm believes it was in the best interest of the company and its &nbsp;shareholders to accept responsibility for these matters, resolve them, and move forward. These settlements will allow the Firm to focus on continuing to serve its clients and communities, and to continue to build the Firm's businesses.Business outlook The following forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Firm's actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 181&#32;of this Annual Report and the Risk Factors section on pages 9&#8211;18&#32;of the 2013 Form 10-K.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The Firm is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. For a summary of the more significant rules and regulations to which it currently is or will shortly be subject, as well as the more noteworthy rules and regulations currently being proposed to be implemented, see Supervision and Regulation on pages 1&#8211;9&#32;of the 2013 Form 10-K. Having reached the minimum capital levels required by the new and proposed rules, the Firm intends to continue to hold excess capital in order to support its businesses. However, the new rules will require the Firm to modify its on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities to meet the supplementary leverage ratio requirements, restrict or limit the way the Firm offers products to customers or charges fees for services, exit certain activities and product offerings, and make structural changes with respect to which of its legal entities offer certain products in order to comply with the margin, extraterritoriality and clearing rules promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The Firm intends to respond to the new financial architecture resulting from this changing landscape in a way that will allow it to grow its revenues over time, manage its expenses, and comply with the new regulatory requirements, while at the same time investing in its businesses and meeting the needs of its customers and clients. Initiatives will include a disciplined approach to capital and liquidity management as well as optimization of the Firm's balance sheet. The Firm intends to continue to meet the higher U.S. and Basel III liquidity requirements and make progress towards meeting all of its capital targets in advance of regulatory deadlines, while at the same time returning capital to its shareholders. For further information, see Liquidity Risk Management and Capital Management on pages 168&#8211;173&#32;and 160&#8211;167, respectively, of this Annual Report.The Firm is also devoting substantial resources in order to continue to execute on its control and regulatory agendas. In 2012, it established its Oversight and Control function, which works closely with all control disciplines, including Compliance, Legal, Risk Management, Internal Audit and other functions, to provide a cohesive and centralized view of control functions and issues and to address complex control-related projects that are cross-line of business and that have significant regulatory impact or respond to regulatory actions such as the Consent Orders. See Operational Risk Management on pages 155&#8211;157&#32;in this Annual Report for further information on the Oversight and Control function. The Firm's control agenda is receiving significant senior management and Board of Director attention and oversight, and represents a very high priority for the Firm, with 23 work-streams currently underway involving more than 3,500 employees. In 2013, the Firm increased the amount spent on the control agenda by approximately $1 billion, and expects to spend an incremental amount of slightly more than $1 billion on the control agenda in 2014. The Firm is also executing a business simplification agenda that will allow it to focus on core activities for its core clients and better manage its operational, regulatory and litigation risks. These initiatives include ceasing student loan originations, ceasing to offer traveler's checks and money orders for non-customers, exiting certain high-complexity arrangements (such as third-party lockbox services), and being more selective about on-boarding certain customers, among other initiatives. These business simplification changes will not fundamentally change the breadth of the Firm's business model. However, they are anticipated to reduce both revenues and expenses over time, although the effect on annualized net income is expected to be modest. In addition, the efforts are also expected to have the benefit of freeing up capital over time. The Firm expects it will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations, capital and liquidity management practices, and legal entity structure in the year ahead in response to developments in the legal and regulatory, as well as business and economic, environment in which it operates. &nbsp;2014 Business OutlookJPMorgan Chase's outlook for the full year 2014 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these inter-related factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its lines of business.The Firm expects that net interest margin will be relatively stable in the near term. Firmwide adjusted expense is expected to be below $59 billion for the full year 2014, excluding firmwide (Corporate and non-Corporate) legal expenses and foreclosure-related matters, even as the Firm continues to invest in controls and compliance.In the Mortgage Banking business within CCB, management expects that higher levels of mortgage interest rates will continue to have a negative impact on refinancing volumes and margins, and, accordingly, the pretax income of Mortgage Production is anticipated to be modestly negative for the first quarter of 2014. For Real Estate Portfolios within Mortgage Banking, if delinquencies continue to trend down and the macro-economic environment remains stable or improves, management expects charge-offs to decline and a further reduction in the allowance for loan losses. In Card Services within CCB, the Firm expects that spread compression will continue in 2014; the shift from high-rate and low-FICO balances is expected to be replaced by more engaged customers or transactors, which is expected to positively affect card spend and credit performance in 2014. If current positive credit trends continue, the card-related allowance for loan losses could be reduced over the course of 2014. The currently anticipated results for CCB described above could be adversely affected if economic conditions, including U.S. housing prices or the unemployment rate, do not continue to improve. Management continues to closely monitor the portfolios in these businesses.In Private Equity, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, earnings will likely continue to be volatile and influenced by capital markets activity, market levels, the performance of the broader economy and investment-specific factors.For Treasury and CIO, within the Corporate/Private Equity segment, as the Firm continues to reinvest its investment securities portfolio, net interest income is expected to improve and to reach break-even during the second half of 2014. Management's discussion and analysisBusiness eventsVisa B SharesIn December 2013, the Firm sold 20 million Visa Class B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of approximately $1.3 billion recorded in Other income.&#160;After the sale, the Firm continues to own approximately 40 million Visa Class B shares. For further information, see Note 2 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report. One Chase Manhattan PlazaOn December 17, 2013, the Firm sold One Chase Manhattan Plaza, an office building located in New York City, and recognized a pretax gain of $493 million&#32;in Other Income.Other eventsFor information about the Firm's announcements regarding the physical commodities business, One Equity Partners, and the student loan business, see Note 2 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report. &nbsp;Subsequent eventsSettlement agreement with The U.S. Departments Of Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Veterans Affairs, and The Federal Housing AdministrationOn February 4, 2014, the Firm announced that it had reached a settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;), and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (&#8220;VA&#8221;) resolving claims relating to the Firm's participation in federal mortgage insurance programs overseen by FHA, HUD and VA (&#8220;FHA Settlement&#8221;).&#160; Under the FHA Settlement, which relates to FHA and VA insurance claims that have been paid to the Firm from 2002 through the date of the settlement, the Firm will pay $614 million in cash, and agree to enhance its quality control program for loans that are submitted in the future to FHA's Direct Endorsement Lender Program.&#160;The Firm is fully reserved for the settlement, and any financial impact related to exposure on future claims is not expected to be significant.&#160;For information about the ongoing collectibility of insurance reimbursements on loans sold to Ginnie Mae, see Note 31 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report.Madoff Litigation and InvestigationsOn January 7, 2014, the Firm announced that certain of its bank subsidiaries had entered into settlements with various governmental agencies in resolution of investigations relating to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (&#8220;BLMIS&#8221;). The Firm and certain of its subsidiaries also entered into settlements with several private parties in resolution of civil litigation relating to BLMIS. At the same time, &#160;certain bank subsidiaries of the Firm consented to the assessment of a civil money penalty by the OCC in connection with various Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering deficiencies, including with relation to the BLMIS fraud, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. additionally agreed to &#160;the assessment of a civil money penalty by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for failure to detect and adequately report suspicious transactions relating to BLMIS. For further information on these settlements, see Note 31 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report.The following section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chase's Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the three-year period ended December 31, 2013. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. For a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations, see pages 174&#8211;178&#32;of this Annual Report.2013 compared with 2012Total net revenue for 2013 was $96.6 billion, down by $425&#160;million, or less than 1%. The results of 2013 were driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, net interest income, and securities gains. These items were predominantly offset by higher principal transactions revenue, and asset management, administration and commissions revenue.Investment banking fees increased compared with the prior year, reflecting higher equity and debt underwriting fees, partially offset by lower advisory fees. Equity and debt underwriting fees increased, driven by strong market issuance and improved wallet share in equity capital markets and loans. Advisory fees decreased, as the industry-wide M&A wallet declined. For additional information on investment banking fees, see CIB segment results on pages 98&#8211;102&#32;and Note 7 on pages 234&#8211;235&#32;of this Annual Report.Principal transactions revenue, which consists of revenue primarily from the Firm's market-making and private equity &nbsp;investing activities, increased compared with the prior year. The current-year period reflected CIB's strong equity markets revenue, partially offset by a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment (&#8220;FVA&#8221;) framework for OTC derivatives and structured notes in the fourth quarter of 2013, and a $452 million loss from DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities (compared with a $930 million loss from DVA in the prior year). The prior year included a $5.8 billion loss on the synthetic credit portfolio incurred by CIO in the six months ended June 30, 2012; a $449 million loss on the index credit derivative positions retained by CIO in the three months ended September 30, 2012; and additional modest losses incurred by CIB from the synthetic credit portfolio in the last six months of 2012; these were partially offset by a $665 million gain recognized in 2012 in Other Corporate, representing the recovery on a Bear Stearns-related subordinated loan. For additional information on principal transactions revenue, see CIB and Corporate/Private Equity segment results on pages 98&#8211;102&#32;and 109&#8211;111, respectively, and Note 7 on pages 234&#8211;235&#32;of this Annual Report.Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased compared with the prior year, largely due to lower deposit-related fees in CCB, resulting from reductions in certain product and transaction fees. For additional information on lending- and deposit-related fees, see the segment results for CCB on pages 86&#8211;97, CIB on pages 98&#8211;102&#32;and CB on pages 103&#8211;105&#32;of this Annual Report.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue increased from 2012. The increase was driven by higher investment management fees in AM, due to net client inflows, the effect of higher market levels, and higher performance fees, as well as higher investment sales revenue in CCB. For additional information on these fees and commissions, see the segment discussions for CIB on pages 98&#8211;102, CCB on pages 86&#8211;97, AM on pages 106&#8211;108, and Note 7 on pages 234&#8211;235&#32;of this Annual Report.Securities gains decreased compared with the prior-year period, reflecting the results of repositioning the CIO available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) portfolio. For additional information on securities gains, see the Corporate/Private Equity segment discussion on pages 109&#8211;111, and Note 12 on pages 249&#8211;254&#32;of this Annual Report.Mortgage fees and related income decreased in 2013 compared with 2012. The decrease resulted from lower Mortgage Banking net production and servicing revenue. The decrease in net production revenue was due to lower margins and volumes. The decrease in net servicing revenue was predominantly due to lower mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) risk management results. For additional information on mortgage fees and related income, see CCB's Mortgage Banking's discussion on pages 92&#8211;93, and Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisCard income increased compared with the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher net interchange income on credit and debit cards and merchant servicing revenue, due to growth in sales volume. For additional information on credit card income, see the CCB segment results on pages 86&#8211;97&#32;of this Annual Report.Other income decreased in 2013 compared with the prior year, predominantly reflecting lower revenues from significant items recorded in Corporate/Private Equity. In 2013, the Firm recognized a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of Visa shares, a $493 million gain from the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and a modest loss related to the redemption of trust preferred securities (&#8220;TruPS&#8221;). In 2012, the Firm recognized a $1.1 billion benefit from the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement and an $888 million extinguishment gain related to the redemption of TruPS. The net decrease was partially offset by higher revenue in CIB, largely from client-driven activity.Net interest income decreased in 2013 compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of the runoff of higher yielding loans and originations of lower yielding loans, and lower trading-related net interest income. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by lower long-term debt and other funding costs. The Firm's average interest-earning assets were $2.0 trillion&#32;in 2013, and the net interest yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis, was 2.23%, a decrease of 25&#32;basis points from the prior year.2012 compared with 2011Total net revenue for 2012 was $97.0 billion, down slightly from 2011. Results for 2012 were driven by lower principal transactions revenue from losses incurred by CIO, and lower net interest income. These items were predominantly offset by higher mortgage fees and related income and higher other income.Investment banking fees decreased slightly from 2011, reflecting lower advisory fees on lower industry-wide volumes, and to a lesser extent, slightly lower equity underwriting fees on industry-wide volumes that were flat from the prior year. These declines were predominantly offset by record debt underwriting fees, driven by favorable market conditions and the impact of continued low interest rates. Principal transactions revenue decreased compared with 2011, predominantly due to $5.8 billion of losses incurred by CIO from the synthetic credit portfolio for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and $449 million of losses incurred by CIO from the retained index credit derivative positions for the three months ended September 30, 2012; and additional modest losses incurred by CIB from the synthetic credit portfolio in the last six months of 2012.Principal transaction revenue also included a $930 million&#32;loss in 2012, compared with a $1.4 billion&#32;gain in 2011, from DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities, resulting from the tightening of the Firm's credit spreads. These declines were partially offset by higher market-&nbsp;making revenue in CIB, driven by strong client revenue and higher revenue in rates-related products, as well as a $665 million&#32;gain recognized in Other Corporate associated with the recovery on a Bear Stearns-related subordinated loan. Private equity gains decreased in 2012, predominantly due to lower unrealized and realized gains on private investments, partially offset by higher unrealized gains on public securities. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased in 2012 compared with the prior year. The decrease predominantly reflected lower lending-related fees in CIB and lower deposit-related fees in CCB.Asset management, administration and commissions revenue decreased from 2011, largely driven by lower brokerage commissions in CIB. This decrease was largely offset by higher asset management fees in AM driven by net client inflows, the effect of higher market levels, and higher performance fees; and higher investment service fees in CCB, as a result of growth in sales of investment products. Securities gains increased, compared with the 2011 level, reflecting the results of repositioning the CIO AFS securities portfolio. Mortgage fees and related income increased significantly in 2012 compared with 2011, due to higher Mortgage Banking net production and servicing revenue. The increase in net production revenue, reflected wider margins driven by favorable market conditions; and higher volumes due to historically low interest rates and the Home Affordable Refinance Programs (&#8220;HARP&#8221;). The increase in net servicing revenue resulted from a favorable swing in risk management results related to mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;), which was a gain of $619 million&#32;in 2012, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion&#32;in 2011. Card income decreased during 2012, driven by lower debit card revenue, reflecting the impact of the Durbin Amendment; and to a lesser extent, higher amortization of loan origination costs. The decrease in credit card income was offset partially by higher net interchange income associated with growth in credit card sales volume, and higher merchant servicing revenue. Other income increased in 2012 compared with the prior year, largely due to a $1.1 billion&#32;benefit from the Washington Mutual bankruptcy settlement, and $888 million&#32;of extinguishment gains in Corporate/Private Equity related to the redemption of TruPS. The extinguishment gains were related to adjustments applied to the cost basis of the TruPS during the period they were in a qualified hedge accounting relationship. These items were offset partially by the absence of a prior-year gain on the sale of an investment in AM.Net interest income decreased in 2012 compared with the prior year, predominantly reflecting the impact of lower average trading asset balances, the runoff of higher-yielding loans, faster prepayment of mortgage-backed securities, limited reinvestment opportunities, as well as the impact of lower interest rates across the Firm's interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by lower deposit and other borrowing costs. The Firm's average interest-earning assets were $1.8 trillion&#32;for 2012, and the net yield on those assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent (&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis, was 2.48%, a decrease of 26&#32;basis points from 2011.2013 compared with 2012The provision for credit losses decreased compared with the prior year, due to a decline in the provision for total consumer credit losses. The decrease in the consumer provision was attributable to continued reductions in the allowance for loan losses, resulting from the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio, and improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, as well as lower net charge-offs partially due to the prior-year incremental charge-offs recorded in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The wholesale provision in the current period reflected a favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for credit losses, see the segment discussions for CCB on pages 86&#8211;97, CIB on pages 98&#8211;102, CB on pages 103&#8211;105, and Allowance For Credit Losses on pages 139&#8211;141&#32;of this Annual Report.2012 compared with 2011The provision for credit losses decreased by $4.2 billion from 2011. The decrease was driven by a lower provision for consumer, excluding credit card loans, which reflected a reduction in the allowance for loan losses, due primarily to lower estimated losses in the non-PCI residential real estate portfolio as delinquency trends improved, partially offset by the impact of charge-offs of Chapter 7 loans. A higher level of recoveries and lower charge-offs in the wholesale provision also contributed to the decrease. These items were partially offset by a higher provision for credit card loans, largely due to a smaller reduction in the allowance for loan losses in 2012 compared with the prior year.&nbsp;2013 compared with 2012Total noninterest expense for 2013 was $70.5 billion, up by $5.7&#32;billion, or 9%, compared with the prior year. The increase was predominantly due to higher legal expense.Compensation expense increased in 2013 compared with the prior year, due to the impact of investments across the businesses, including front office sales and support staff, as well as costs related to the Firm's control agenda; partially offset by lower compensation expense in CIB and a decline in CCB's mortgage business, which included the effect of lower servicing headcount.Noncompensation expense increased in 2013 from the prior year. The increase was due to higher other expense, reflecting $11.1 billion&#32;of firmwide legal expense, predominantly in Corporate/Private Equity, representing additional reserves for several litigation and regulatory proceedings, compared with $5.0 billion&#32;of expense in the prior year. Investments in the businesses, higher legal-related professional services expense, and costs related to the Firm's control agenda also contributed to the increase. The increase was offset partially by lower mortgage servicing expense in CCB and lower occupancy expense for the Firm, which predominantly reflected the absence of charges recognized in 2012 related to vacating excess space. For a further discussion of legal expense, see Note 31 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report. For a discussion of amortization of intangibles, refer to Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysis2012 compared with 2011Total noninterest expense for 2012 was $64.7&#32;billion , up by $1.8 billion, or 3%, from 2011. Compensation expense drove the increase from the prior year.Compensation expense increased from the prior year, predominantly due to investments in the businesses, including the sales force in CCB and bankers in the other businesses, partially offset by lower compensation expense in CIB.Noncompensation expense for 2012 increased from the prior year, reflecting continued investments in the businesses, including branch builds in CCB; higher expense related to growth in business volume in CIB and CCB; higher regulatory deposit insurance assessments; expenses related to exiting a non-core product and writing-off intangible assets in CCB; and higher legal expense in Corporate/Private Equity. These increases were partially offset by lower legal expense in AM and CCB (including the Independent Foreclosure Review settlement) and lower marketing expense in CCB. &nbsp;2013 compared with 2012The increase in the effective tax rate compared with the prior year was predominantly due to the effect of higher nondeductible expense related to&#160;litigation and regulatory proceedings in 2013.&#160;This was largely offset by the impact of lower reported pre-tax income in combination with changes in the mix of income and expense subject to U.S.&#160;federal, state and local taxes, business tax credits, tax benefits associated with prior year tax adjustments and audit resolutions. For additional information on income taxes, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 174&#8211;178&#32;and Note 26 on pages 313&#8211;315&#32;of this Annual Report.2012 compared with 2011The decrease in the effective tax rate compared with the prior year was largely the result of changes in the proportion of income subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, as well as higher tax benefits associated with tax audits and tax-advantaged investments. This was partially offset by higher reported pretax income and lower benefits associated with the disposition of certain investments. The current and prior periods include deferred tax benefits associated with state and local income taxes.&nbsp;Consolidated Balance Sheets overview Total assets increased by $56.5 billion&#32;or 2%, and total liabilities increased by $49.4 billion&#32;or 2%, from December 31, 2012. The following is a discussion of the significant changes in the specific line item captions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets during 2013.Cash and due from banks and deposits with banksThe net increase reflected the placement of the Firm's excess funds with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve Banks. For additional information, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 168&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report.Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements; and securities borrowed The decrease in securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed was predominantly due to a shift in the deployment of the Firm's excess cash by Treasury.Trading assets and liabilities &#8211;&#32;debt and equity instrumentsThe decrease in trading assets was driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB, which resulted in lower levels of debt securities. For additional information, refer to Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report.The increase in trading liabilities was driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt and equity securities.Trading assets and liabilities &#8211;&#32;derivative receivables and payablesDerivative receivables and payables decreased predominantly due to reductions in interest rate derivatives driven by an increase in interest rates and reductions in commodity derivatives due to market movements. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in equity derivatives driven by a rise in equity markets.For additional information, refer to Derivative contracts on pages 135&#8211;136, and Note 3 and Note 6 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;and 220&#8211;233, respectively, of this Annual Report.SecuritiesThe decrease in securities was largely due to repositioning which resulted in lower levels of corporate debt, non-U.S. government securities and non-U.S. residential MBS. The decrease was partially offset by higher levels of U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities. For additional information related to securities, refer to the discussion in the Corporate/Private Equity segment on pages 109&#8211;111, and Note 3 and Note 12 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;and 249&#8211;254, respectively, of this Annual Report.Loans and allowance for loan lossesLoans increased predominantly due to continued growth in wholesale loans partially offset by a decrease in consumer, Management's discussion and analysisexcluding credit card loans, predominantly due to paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans, partially offset by new mortgage and auto originations.The allowance for loan losses decreased as a result of a $5.5 billion&#32;reduction in the consumer allowance, reflecting the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio and improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios. For a more detailed discussion of the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses, refer to Credit Risk Management on pages 119&#8211;141, and Notes 3, 4, 14 and 15 on pages 195&#8211;215, 215&#8211;218, 258&#8211;283&#32;and 284&#8211;287, respectively, of this Annual Report.Premises and EquipmentThe increase in premises and equipment was largely due to investments in CBB in the U.S. and other investments in facilities globally.Mortgage servicing rightsThe increase was predominantly due to originations and changes in market interest rates, partially offset by collection/realization of expected cash flows, dispositions, and changes in valuation due to model inputs and assumptions. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report.Other assetsThe increase is primarily driven by the implementation of gross initial margin requirements for certain U.S. counterparties for exchange-traded derivatives (&#8220;ETD&#8221;), higher ETD margin balances, and mandatory clearing for certain over-the-counter derivative contracts in the U.S.DepositsThe increase was due to growth in both wholesale and consumer deposits. The increase in wholesale client balances was due to higher short-term deposits as well as growth in client operating balances. Consumer deposit balances increased from the effect of continued strong growth in business volumes and strong customer retention. For more information on consumer deposits, refer to the CCB segment discussion on pages 86&#8211;97; the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 168&#8211;173; and Notes 3 and 19 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;and 305, respectively, of this Annual Report. For more information on wholesale client deposits, refer to the AM, CB and CIB segment discussions on pages 106&#8211;108, 103&#8211;105&#32;and 98&#8211;102, respectively, of this Annual Report.Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements The decrease was predominantly due to a change in the mix of the Firm's funding sources. For additional information on the Firm's Liquidity Risk Management, see pages 168&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;Commercial paper and other borrowed fundsCommercial paper increased slightly due to higher commercial paper issuance from wholesale funding markets and an increase in the volume of liability balances related to CIB's liquidity management product, whereby clients choose to sweep their deposits into commercial paper. Other borrowed funds increased slightly due to higher secured short-term borrowings to meet short-term funding needs. For additional information on the Firm's Liquidity Risk Management and other borrowed funds, see pages 168&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report.Accounts payable and other liabilitiesAccounts payable and other liabilities remained relatively flat compared with the prior year. For additional information on the Firm's accounts payable and other liabilities, see Note 20 on page 305&#32;of this Annual Report.Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEsBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs decreased primarily due to unwinds of municipal bond vehicles, net credit card maturities and a reduction in outstanding conduit commercial paper held by third parties. For additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts, see Note 16 on pages 288&#8211;299&#32;of this Annual Report.Long-term debtThe increase was primarily due to net issuances, which also reflected the redemption of trust preferred securities in the second quarter of 2013. For additional information on the Firm's long-term debt activities, see the Liquidity Risk Management discussion on pages 168&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report.Stockholders' equityTotal stockholders' equity increased, predominantly due to net income; net issuance of preferred stock; and the issuances and commitments to issue under the Firm's employee stock-based compensation plans. The increase was partially offset by the declaration of cash dividends on common and preferred stock, repurchases of common stock and a net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. The net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily related to the decline in fair value of U.S. government agency issued MBS and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities due to market changes, as well as net realized gains. For additional information on the Firm's capital actions, see Capital actions on pages 166&#8211;167&#32;of this Annual Report.In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are off-balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. The Firm is involved with several types of off&#8211;balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (&#8220;SPEs&#8221;), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).Special-purpose entitiesThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. SPEs are an important part of the financial markets, including the mortgage- and asset-backed securities and commercial paper markets, as they provide market liquidity by facilitating investors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. SPEs may be organized as trusts, partnerships or corporations and are typically established for a single, discrete purpose. SPEs are not typically operating entities and usually have a limited life and no employees. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors.JPMorgan Chase uses SPEs as a source of liquidity for itself and its clients by securitizing financial assets, and by creating investment products for clients. The Firm is involved with SPEs through multi-seller conduits, investor intermediation activities, and loan securitizations. See Note 16 on pages 288&#8211;299&#32;for further information on these types of SPEs.The Firm holds capital, as deemed appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative transactions and lending-related commitments and guarantees.The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm's length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm's Code of Conduct. These rules prohibit employees from self-dealing and acting on behalf of the Firm in transactions with which they or their family have any significant financial interest.Implications of a credit rating downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could be required to provide funding if its short-term credit rating were downgraded below specific levels, primarily &#8220;P-1&#8221;, &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;F1&#8221; for Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively. These liquidity commitments support the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by both Firm-administered consolidated and third-party &nbsp;sponsored nonconsolidated SPEs. In the event of such a short-term credit rating downgrade, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., absent other solutions, would be required to provide funding to the SPE, if the commercial paper could not be reissued as it matured. The aggregate amounts of commer-cial paper outstanding, issued by both Firm-administered and third-party sponsored SPEs, that are held by third parties as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, was $15.5 billion&#32;and $18.1 billion, respectively. The aggregate amounts of commercial paper outstanding could increase in future periods should clients of the Firm-administered consolidated or third-party sponsored nonconsolidated SPEs draw down on certain unfunded lending-related commitments. These unfunded lending-related commit-ments were $9.2 billion&#32;and $10.9 billion&#32;at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Firm could facilitate the refinancing of some of the clients' assets in order to reduce the funding obligation. For further information, see the discussion of Firm-administered multi-seller conduits in Note 16 on pages 292&#8211;293&#32;of this Annual Report.The Firm also acts as liquidity provider for certain municipal bond vehicles. The Firm's obligation to perform as liquidity provider is conditional and is limited by certain termination events, which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. See Note 16 on pages 288&#8211;299&#32;of this Annual Report for additional information.Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments, and the Firm's accounting for them, see Lending-related commitments on page 135, and Note 29 (including the table that presents the related amounts by contractual maturity as of December&#160;31, 2013) on pages 318&#8211;324&#32;of this Annual Report. For a discussion of loan repurchase liabilities, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 78&#8211;79&#32;and Note 29 on pages 318&#8211;324, respectively, of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisContractual cash obligationsThe accompanying table summarizes, by remaining maturity, JPMorgan Chase's significant contractual cash obligations at December&#160;31, 2013. The contractual cash obligations included in the table below reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with terms that are both fixed and determinable. Excluded from the below table are certain liabilities with variable cash flows and/or no contractual maturity.&nbsp;The carrying amount of on-balance sheet obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets may differ from the minimum contractual amount of the obligations reported below. For a discussion of mortgage loan repurchase liabilities, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 78&#8211;79&#32;of this Annual Report. For further discussion of other obligations, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.Mortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the &#8220;GSEs&#8221;) and other mortgage loan sale and private-label securitization transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm has been, and may be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs (e.g., with &#8220;make-whole&#8221; payments to reimburse the GSEs for realized losses on liquidated loans) and other investors for losses due to material breaches of these representations &nbsp;and warranties. To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party.On October 25, 2013, the Firm announced it had reached a $1.1 billion&#32;agreement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (&#8220;FHFA&#8221;) to resolve, other than certain limited types of exposures, outstanding and future mortgage repurchase demands associated with loans sold to the GSEs from 2000 to 2008 (&#8220;FHFA Settlement Agreement&#8221;). The majority of the mortgage repurchase demands that the Firm had received from the GSEs related to loans originated from 2005 to 2008.The Firm has recognized a mortgage repurchase liability of $681 million&#32;and $2.8 billion&#32;as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. The amount of the mortgage repurchase liability at December 31, 2013, relates to repurchase losses associated with loans sold in connection with loan sale and securitization transactions with the GSEs that are not covered by the FHFA Settlement Agreement (e.g., post-2008 loan sale and securitization transactions, mortgage insurance rescissions and certain mortgage insurance settlement-related exposures, as well as certain other specific exclusions). At December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm had outstanding repurchase demands of $330 million&#32;and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices of $263 million&#32;(excluding mortgage insurance rescission notices on loans for which a repurchase demand also has been received).The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.&nbsp;Private label securitizationsThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. On November 15, 2013, the Firm announced it had reached a $4.5 billion&#32;agreement with 21 major institutional investors to make a binding offer to the trustees of 330 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by J.P.Morgan, Chase and Bear Stearns (&#8220;RMBS Trust Settlement&#8221;) to resolve all representation and warranty claims, as well as all servicing claims, on all trusts issued by J.P.Morgan, Chase and Bear Stearns between 2005 and 2008. The RMBS Trust Settlement may be subject to court approval. For further information about the RMBS Trust Settlement, see Note 31 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report.In addition, from 2005 to 2008, Washington Mutual made certain loan level representations and warranties in connection with approximately $165 billion&#32;of residential mortgage loans that were originally sold or deposited into private-label securitizations by Washington Mutual. Of the $165 billion, approximately $75 billion&#32;has been repaid. In addition, approximately $47 billion&#32;of the principal amount of such loans has liquidated with an average loss severity of 59%. Accordingly, the remaining outstanding principal balance of these loans as of December&#160;31, 2013, was approximately $43 billion, of which $10 billion&#32;was 60 days or more past due. The Firm believes that any repurchase obligations related to these loans remain with the FDIC receivership.For additional information regarding the mortgage repurchase liability, see Note 29 on pages 318&#8211;324&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisFor the years ended December&#160;31, 2013, 2012&#32;and 2011, cash and due from banks decreased $14.0 billion&#32;and $5.9 billion, and increased $32.0 billion, respectively. The following discussion highlights the major activities and transactions that affected JPMorgan Chase's cash flows during 2013, 2012&#32;and 2011, respectively.Cash flows from operating activitiesJPMorgan Chase's operating assets and liabilities support the Firm's capital markets and lending activities, including the origination or purchase of loans initially designated as held-for-sale. Operating assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities, and market conditions. Management believes cash flows from operations, available cash balances and the Firm's ability to generate cash through short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund the Firm's operating liquidity needs.For the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $108.0 billion, and it was significantly higher than net income. This resulted from a decrease in trading assets - debt and equity instruments driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB, which resulted in lower levels of debt securities; and an increase in trading liabilities &#8211; debt and equity instruments driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB, which resulted in higher levels of short positions in debt and equity securities. Net cash generated from operating activities also reflected adjustments for noncash items such as deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was cash used for loans originated and purchased with an initial intent to sell, which was slightly higher than the cash proceeds received from sales and paydowns of the loans, and also reflected significantly higher levels of activities over the prior-year period. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $25.1 billion. This resulted from a decrease in securities borrowed reflecting a shift in the deployment of excess cash to resale agreements, as well as lower client activity in CIB, and lower trading assets - derivative receivables, primarily related to the decline in the U.S. dollar and tightening of credit spreads. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities predominantly due to lower CIB client balances, and an increase in trading assets - debt and equity instruments driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB. Net cash generated from operating activities was higher than net income largely as a result of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization, provision for credit losses, and stock-based compensation. Cash used to acquire loans was slightly higher than cash proceeds received from sales and paydowns of such loans originated and purchased with an &nbsp;initial intent to sell, and also reflected a lower level of activity compared with the prior-year period.For the year ended December&#160;31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $95.9 billion, and it was significantly higher than net income. This resulted from a net decrease in trading assets and liabilities &#8211; debt and equity instruments, driven by client-driven market-making activity in CIB; an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities predominantly due to higher CIB client balances, and a decrease in accrued interest and accounts receivables, primarily in CIB, driven by a large reduction in customer margin receivables due to changes in client activity. Net cash generated from operating activities also reflected adjustments for noncash items such as the provision for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Additionally, cash provided from sales and paydowns of loans originated or purchased with an initial intent to sell was higher than cash used to acquire such loans. Partially offsetting these cash proceeds was an increase in securities borrowed, predominantly in Corporate due to higher excess cash positions at year-end.Cash flows from investing activitiesThe Firm's investing activities predominantly include loans originated to be held for investment, the investment securities portfolio and other short-term interest-earning assets. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, net cash of $150.5 billion&#32;was used in investing activities. This resulted from an increase in deposits with banks reflecting the placement of the Firm's excess funds with various central banks, predominantly Federal Reserve banks; and continued growth of wholesale loans. Partially offsetting this cash outflow was a decrease in securities purchased under resale agreements predominantly due to a shift in the deployment of the Firm's excess cash by Treasury; a decrease in consumer loans excluding credit card loans, predominantly due to paydowns and liquidation of delinquent loans, partially offset by new mortgage and auto originations; and proceeds from maturities and sales of investment securities which were higher than the cash used to acquire new investment securities.For the year ended December&#160;31, 2012, net cash of $119.8 billion was used in investing activities. This resulted from an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements due to deployment of the Firm's excess cash by Treasury; higher deposits with banks reflecting placements of the Firm's excess cash with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks; and higher levels of wholesale loans, primarily in CB and AM, driven by higher wholesale activity across most of the Firm's regions and businesses. Partially offsetting these cash outflows were a decline in consumer, excluding credit card, loans predominantly due to mortgage-related paydowns and portfolio runoff, and a decline in credit card loans due to higher repayment rates; and proceeds from maturities and sales of AFS securities, which were higher than the cash used to acquire new AFS securities.For the year ended December&#160;31, 2011, net cash of $170.8 billion was used in investing activities. This resulted from a significant increase in deposits with banks reflecting the placement of funds with various central banks, including Federal Reserve Banks, predominantly resulting from the overall growth in wholesale client deposits; an increase in loans reflecting continued growth in client activity across all of the Firm's wholesale businesses and regions; net purchases of AFS securities, largely due to repositioning of the portfolio in Corporate in response to changes in the market environment; and an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements, predominantly in Corporate due to higher excess cash positions at year-end. Partially offsetting these cash outflows were a decline in consumer, excluding credit card, loan balances due to paydowns and portfolio runoff, and in credit card loans, due to higher repayment rates, runoff of the Washington Mutual portfolio and the Firm's sale of the Kohl's portfolio.Cash flows from financing activitiesThe Firm's financing activities predominantly include taking customer deposits, and issuing long-term debt as well as preferred and common stock. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was $28.3 billion. This increase was driven by growth in both wholesale and consumer deposits; net issuances of long-term borrowings, which also reflected the redemption of trust preferred securities in the second quarter of 2013; and proceeds from the net issuance of preferred stock. The increase in wholesale client deposit balances was due to higher short-term deposits as well as growth in client operating balances. Consumer deposit balances increased from the effect of continued strong growth in business volumes and strong customer retention. Partially offsetting these cash inflows was a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, predominantly due to a change in the mix of the Firm's funding sources; repurchases of common stock; and payments of cash dividends on common and preferred stock.For the year ended December&#160;31, 2012, net cash provided by financing activities was $87.7 billion. This was driven by proceeds from long-term borrowings and a higher level of securitized credit cards; an increase in deposits due to growth in both consumer and wholesale deposits; an increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements due to higher secured financings of the Firm's assets; an increase in commercial paper issuance in the wholesale funding markets to meet short-term funding needs, partially offset by a decline in the volume of client deposits and other third-party liability balances related to CIB's liquidity management product; an increase in other borrowed funds due to higher secured and unsecured short-term borrowings to meet short-term funding needs; and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. Partially offsetting these cash inflows were &nbsp;redemptions and maturities of long-term borrowings, including trust preferred securities, and securitized credit cards; and payments of cash dividends on common and preferred stock and repurchases of common stock and warrants.For the year ended December&#160;31, 2011, net cash provided by financing activities was $107.7 billion. This was largely driven by a significant increase in deposits, predominantly due to an overall growth in wholesale client balances and, to a lesser extent, consumer deposit balances. The increase in wholesale client balances, particularly in CIB and CB, was primarily driven by lower returns on other available alternative investments and low interest rates during 2011, and in AM, driven by growth in the number of clients and level of deposits. In addition, there was an increase in commercial paper due to growth in the volume of liability balances in sweep accounts related to CIB's cash management program. Cash was used to reduce securities sold under repurchase agreements, predominantly in CIB, reflecting the lower funding requirements of the Firm based on lower trading inventory levels, and change in the mix of funding sources; for net repayments of long-term borrowings, including a decrease in long-term debt, predominantly due to net redemptions and maturities, as well as a decline in long-term beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs due to maturities of Firm-sponsored credit card securitization transactions; to reduce other borrowed funds, predominantly driven by maturities of short-term secured borrowings, unsecured bank notes and short-term Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLB") advances; and for repurchases of common stock and warrants, and payments of cash dividends on common and preferred stock.Management's discussion and analysisThe Firm prepares its consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.(&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;); these financial statements appear on pages 184&#8211;188&#32;of this Annual Report. That presentation, which is referred to as &#8220;reported&#8221; basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews the Firm's results and the results of the lines of business on a &#8220;managed&#8221; basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in &nbsp;the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the business-segment level, because it believes these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the business segment with the performance of its competitors. Non- GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.(a) Predominantly recognized in CIB and CB business segments and Corporate/Private Equity.Tangible common equity (&#8220;TCE&#8221;), ROTCE, tangible book value per share (&#8220;TBVS&#8221;), and Tier 1 common under Basel I and III rules are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm's common stockholders' equity (i.e., total stockholders' equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm's earnings as a percentage of TCE. TBVS represents the Firm's tangible common equity divided by period-end common shares. Tier 1 common under Basel I and III rules are used by management, along with other capital measures, to assess and monitor the Firm's capital position. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVS are meaningful to the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm's use of equity. The Firm uses ROTCE, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its use of equity and to facilitate comparisons with competitors. For additional information on Tier 1 common under Basel I and III, see Regulatory capital on pages 161&#8211;165&#32;of this Annual Report. &nbsp;Core net interest incomeIn addition to reviewing net interest income on a managed basis, management also reviews core net interest income to assess the performance of its core lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities (which excludes the impact of CIB's market-based activities). The core data presented below are non-GAAP financial measures due to the exclusion of CIB's market-based net interest income and the related assets. Management believes this exclusion provides investors and analysts a more meaningful measure by which to analyze the non-market-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on core lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.&nbsp;2013 compared with 2012Core net interest income decreased by $829 million&#32;to $39.0 billion&#32;for 2013, and core average interest-earning assets increased by $122.9 billion&#32;in 2013 to $1,466.0 billion. The decline in net interest income in 2013 primarily reflected the impact of the runoff of higher yielding loans and originations of lower yielding loans. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by lower long-term debt and other funding costs. The increase in average interest-earning assets reflected the impact of higher deposits with banks. The core net interest yield decreased by 31&#32;basis points to 2.66%&#32;in 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of a significant increase in deposits with banks and lower loan yields, partially offset by the impact of lower long-term debt yields and deposit rates.2012 compared with 2011Core net interest income decreased by $1.0 billion&#32;to $39.9 billion&#32;for 2012, and core average interest-earning assets increased by $101.4 billion&#32;in 2012 to $1,343.1 billion. The decline in net interest income in 2012 reflected the impact of the runoff of higher-yielding loans, faster prepayment of mortgage-backed securities, and limited reinvestment opportunities, as well as the impact of lower interest rates across the Firm's interest-earning assets. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by lower deposit and other borrowing costs. The increase in average interest-earning assets was driven by higher deposits with banks and other short-term investments, increased levels of loans, and an increase in investment securities. The core net interest yield decreased by 32&#32;basis points to 2.97% in 2012, primarily driven by the runoff of higher-yielding loans, lower customer loan rates, higher financing costs associated with mortgage-backed securities, and limited reinvestment opportunities, slightly offset by lower customer deposit rates.Management's discussion and analysisThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four major reportable business segments &#8211; Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate/Private Equity segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer &nbsp;served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm's use of non-GAAP financial measures, on pages 82&#8211;83&#32;of this Annual Report.Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were essentially a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results allocates income and expense using market-based methodologies. The Firm continues to assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Revenue sharingWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm's clients, the participating business segments agree to share revenue from those transactions. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.Funds transfer pricingFunds transfer pricing is used to allocate interest income and expense to each business and transfer the primary interest rate risk exposures to the Treasury group within Corporate/Private Equity. The allocation process is unique &nbsp;to each business segment and considers the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements of that segment as if it were operating independently, and as compared with its stand-alone peers. This process is overseen by senior management and reviewed by the Firm's Asset-Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;).Business segment capital allocation changesEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III) and economic risk measures. The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. Effective January 1, 2013, the Firm refined the capital allocation framework to align it with the line of business structure described above. The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses is largely driven by evolving regulatory requirements and the higher capital targets the Firm has established under the Basel III Advanced Approach. For further information about these capital changes, see Line of business equity on pages 165&#8211;166&#32;of this Annual Report.Expense allocationWhere business segments use services provided by support units within the Firm, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on actual cost and upon usage of the services provided. In contrast, certain other expense related to certain corporate functions, or to certain technology and &nbsp;operations, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Retained expense includes: parent company costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses; adjustments to align certain corporate staff, technology and operations allocations with market prices; and other items not aligned with a particular business segment.Segment Results &#8211; Managed BasisThe following table summarizes the business segment results for the periods indicated.Management's discussion and analysis&nbsp;2013 compared with 2012Consumer & Community Banking net income was $10.7 billion, an increase of $198 million, or 2%, compared with the prior year, due to lower provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense, predominantly offset by lower net revenue.Net revenue was $46.0 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion, or 8%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $28.5 billion, down $597 million, or 2%, driven by lower deposit margins, lower loan balances due to net portfolio runoff and spread compression in Credit Card, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $17.6 billion, a decrease of $3.3 billion, or 16%, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by higher card income.The provision for credit losses was $335 million, compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $5.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $5.8 billion. The prior-year provision reflected a $5.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses and total net charge-offs of $9.3 billion, including $800 million of incremental charge-offs related to regulatory guidance. For more information, including net charge-off amounts and rates, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;of this Annual Report.Noninterest expense was $27.8 billion, a decrease of $985 million, or 3%, from the prior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing expense, partially offset by investments in Chase Private Client expansion, higher non-MBS related legal expense in Mortgage Production, higher auto lease depreciation, and costs related to the control agenda.2012 compared with 2011Consumer & Community Banking net income was $10.6 billion, up 73% when compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.Net revenue was $49.9 billion, up $4.3 billion, or 9%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $29.1 billion, down $1.2 billion, or 4%, driven by lower deposit margins and lower loan balances due to portfolio runoff, largely offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $20.8 billion, up $5.5 billion, or 36%, driven by higher mortgage fees and related income, partially offset by lower debit card revenue, reflecting the impact of the Durbin Amendment.The provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion compared with $7.6 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $5.5 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to improved delinquency trends and reduced estimated losses in the real estate and credit card loan portfolios. Current-year total net charge-offs were $9.3 billion, including $800 million of incremental charge-offs related to regulatory guidance. Excluding these charge-offs, net charge-offs during the year would have been $8.5 billion compared with $11.8 billion in the prior year. For more information, including net charge-off amounts and rates, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;of this Annual Report.Noninterest expense was $28.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 4%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher production expense reflecting higher volumes, and investments in sales force, partially offset by lower costs related to mortgage-related matters and lower marketing expense in Card.&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisConsumer & Business Banking2013 compared with 2012Consumer & Business Banking&#32;net income was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $322 million, or 10%, compared with the prior year, due to higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue.Net revenue was $17.3 billion, up 1% compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $10.6 billion, flat compared with the prior year, driven by higher deposit balances, offset by lower deposit margin. Noninterest revenue was $6.7 billion, an increase of 3%, driven by higher investment sales revenue and debit card revenue, partially offset by lower deposit-related fees. The provision for credit losses was $347 million, compared with $311 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $12.2 billion, up 6% from the prior year, reflecting continued investments in the business, and costs related to the control agenda.&nbsp;2012 compared with 2011Consumer & Business Banking net income was $3.2 billion, a decrease of $496 million, or 13%, compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $17.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year. Net interest income was $10.6 billion, down 1% from the prior year, driven by the impact of lower deposit margins, predominantly offset by higher deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $6.6 billion, down 9% from the prior year, driven by lower debit card revenue, reflecting the impact of the Durbin Amendment.The provision for credit losses was $311 million, compared with $419 million in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Net charge-offs were $411 million compared with $494 million in the prior year.Noninterest expense was $11.5 billion, up 1% from the prior year, resulting from investment in the sales force and new branch builds.Mortgage Banking&nbsp;2013 compared with 2012Mortgage Banking&#32;net income was $3.1 billion, a decrease of $259 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower net revenue, predominantly offset by a higher benefit from the provision for credit losses and lower noninterest expense. Net revenue was $10.0 billion, a decrease of $3.9 billion compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $4.5 billion, a decrease of $260 million, or 5%, driven by lower loan balances due to net portfolio runoff. Noninterest revenue was $5.5 billion, a decrease of $3.7 billion, driven by lower mortgage fees and related income.The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $2.7 billion, compared with a benefit of $490 million in the prior year. The current year reflected a $3.8 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. The prior year included a $3.9 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses. Noninterest expense was $7.6 billion, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 17%, from the prior year, due to lower servicing expense, partially offset by higher non-MBS related legal expense in Mortgage Production.2012 compared with 2011Mortgage Banking&#32;net income was $3.3 billion, compared with a net loss of $2.1 billion in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net revenue and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.Net revenue was $14.0 billion, up $5.4 billion, or 64%, compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $4.8 billion, down $516 million, or 10%, resulting from lower loan balances due to net portfolio runoff. Noninterest revenue was $9.2 billion, up $6.0 billion compared with the prior year, driven by higher mortgage fees and related income.The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $490 million, compared with a provision expense of $3.6 billion in the prior year. The current year reflected a $3.85 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses.Noninterest expense was $9.1 billion, an increase of $865 million, or 10%, compared with the prior year, driven by higher production expense reflecting higher volumes, partially offset by lower costs related to mortgage-related matters.Management's discussion and analysis&nbsp;2013 compared with 2012Mortgage Production&#32;pretax income was $825 million, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower margins, lower volumes and higher legal expense, partially offset by a benefit in repurchase losses. Production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $3.6 billion, a decrease of $3.0 billion, or 45%, from the prior year, largely reflecting lower margins and lower volumes from rising rates. Production expense was $3.1 billion, an increase of $341 million from the prior year, due to higher non-MBS related legal expense and higher compensation-related expense. Repurchase losses for the current year reflected a benefit of $331 million, compared with repurchase losses of $272 million in the prior year. The current year reflected a reduction in repurchase liability largely as a result of the settlement with the GSEs. For further information, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 78&#8211;79&#32;of this Annual Report.Mortgage Servicing&#32;pretax loss was $372 million, compared with a pretax loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year, driven by lower expense, partially offset by mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) risk management loss. Mortgage net servicing-related revenue was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $88 million. MSR risk management was a loss of $268 million, compared with income of $616 million in the prior year, driven by the net impact of various changes in model inputs and assumptions. See Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges. &nbsp;Servicing expense was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower costs associated with the Independent Foreclosure Review and lower servicing headcount.Real Estate Portfolios&#32;pretax income was $4.7 billion, up $1.7 billion from the prior year, due to a higher benefit from the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net revenue. Net revenue was $3.5 billion, a decrease of $580 million, or 14%, from the prior year. This decrease was due to lower net interest income, resulting from lower loan balances due to net portfolio runoff, and lower noninterest revenue due to higher loan retention. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $2.7 billion, compared with a benefit of $509 million in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $3.8 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses, $2.3 billion from the non credit-impaired allowance and $1.5 billion from the purchased credit-impaired allowance, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies. The prior-year provision included a $3.9 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses from the non credit-impaired allowance. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year. Prior-year total net charge-offs included $744 million of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. See Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;of this Annual Report for the net charge-off amounts and rates. Noninterest expense was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $100 million, or 6%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower foreclosed asset expense due to lower foreclosure inventory, largely offset by higher FDIC-related expense.2012 compared with 2011Mortgage Production pretax income was $3.6 billion, an increase of $2.6 billion compared with the prior year. Mortgage production-related revenue, excluding repurchase losses, was $6.6 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 55%, from the prior year. These results reflected wider margins, driven by favorable market conditions, and higher volumes due to historically low interest rates and the Home Affordable Refinance Programs (&#8220;HARP&#8221;). Production expense, including credit costs, was $2.7 billion, an increase of $852 million, or 45%, reflecting higher volumes and additional litigation costs. Repurchase losses were $272 million, compared with $1.3 billion in the prior year. The current-year reflected a reduction in the repurchase liability of $683 million compared with a build of $213 million in the prior year, primarily driven by improved cure rates on Agency repurchase demands and lower outstanding repurchase demand pipeline. For further information, see Mortgage repurchase liability on pages 78&#8211;79&#32;of this Annual Report.Mortgage Servicing reported a pretax loss of $1.2 billion, compared with a pretax loss of $3.8 billion in the prior year. Mortgage servicing revenue, including amortization, was $3.0 billion, an increase of $337 million, or 13%, from the Management's discussion and analysisprior year, driven by lower mortgage servicing rights (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) asset amortization expense as a result of lower MSR asset value, partially offset by lower loan servicing revenue due to the decline in the third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management income was $616 million, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in the prior year. The prior year MSR risk management loss was driven by refinements to the valuation model and related inputs. See Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges. Servicing expense was $4.7 billion, down 2% from the prior year, but elevated in both the current and prior year primarily due to higher default servicing costs.Real Estate Portfolios pretax income was $2.9 billion, compared with a pretax loss of $504 million in the prior year. The improvement was driven by a benefit from the provision for credit losses, reflecting the continued improvement in credit trends, partially offset by lower net revenue. Net revenue was $4.1 billion, down $500 million, or 11%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a decline in net interest income as a result of lower loan balances due to net portfolio runoff. The provision for credit losses reflected a benefit of $509 million, compared with a provision expense of $3.6 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected a $3.9 billion reduction in the non credit-impaired allowance for loan losses due to improved delinquency trends and lower estimated losses. Current-year net charge-offs totaled $3.3 billion, including $744 million of incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year. See Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;of this Annual Report for the net charge-off amounts and rates. Nonaccrual loans were $7.9 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in the prior year. Excluding the impact of certain regulatory guidance, nonaccrual loans would have been $4.9 billion at December 31, 2012. For more information on the reporting of Chapter 7 loans and performing junior liens that are subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due as nonaccrual, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;of this Annual Report. Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion, up $132 million, or 9%, compared with the prior year due to an increase in servicing costs.PCI LoansIncluded within Real Estate Portfolios are PCI loans that the Firm acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. For PCI loans, the excess of the undiscounted gross cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the loans (the &#8220;accretable yield&#8221;) is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the expected life of the loans.The net spread between the PCI loans and the related liabilities are expected to be relatively constant over time, except for any basis risk or other residual interest rate risk that remains and for certain changes in the accretable yield percentage (e.g., from extended loan liquidation periods &nbsp;and from prepayments). As of December 31, 2013, the remaining weighted-average life of the PCI loan portfolio is expected to be 8&#32;years. The loan balances are expected to decline more rapidly over the next three years as the most troubled loans are liquidated, and more slowly thereafter as the remaining troubled borrowers have limited refinancing opportunities. Similarly, default and servicing expense are expected to be higher in the earlier years and decline over time as liquidations slow down.For further information, see Note 14, PCI loans, on pages 274&#8211;276&#32;of this Annual Report.or more days past due; and (2) real estate owned insured by U.S. government agencies of $2.0 billion, $1.6 billion, and $954 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. For further discussion, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report which summarizes loan delinquency information.&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysis&nbsp;Mortgage servicing-related mattersThe financial crisis resulted in unprecedented levels of delinquencies and defaults of 1-4 family residential real estate loans. Such loans required varying degrees of loss mitigation activities. Foreclosure is usually a last resort, and accordingly, the Firm has made, and continues to make, significant efforts to help borrowers remain in their homes.The Firm has a well-defined foreclosure prevention process when a borrower fails to pay on his or her loan. The Firm makes multiple attempts, in various ways, to contact the borrower in an effort to pursue home retention or options other than foreclosure. If the Firm is unable to contact a borrower, the Firm completes various reviews of the borrower's facts and circumstances before a foreclosure sale is completed. Over the last year, the average delinquency period for the borrower at the time of foreclosure was approximately 28 months.The high volume of delinquent and defaulted mortgages experienced during the financial crisis placed a significant amount of stress on servicing operations in the industry. The GSEs impose compensatory fees on mortgage servicers, including the Firm, if such servicers are unable to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs. The Firm has incurred, and continues to incur, compensatory fees, which are reported in default servicing expense. The Firm has made, and will continue to make changes to and refine its mortgage operations to address mortgage servicing, loss mitigation, and foreclosure issues.Since 2011, the Firm has entered into Consent Orders and settlements with federal and state governmental agencies and private parties related to mortgage servicing, origination, and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. The terms of these Consent Orders and settlements vary, but in general, required cash compensatory payments or fines and/or &#8220;borrower relief,&#8221; including principal reductions, refinancing, short sale assistance, and other specified types of borrower relief. The Firm has satisfied or is committed to satisfying these obligations within the mandated timeframes. Other obligations required under Consent Orders and settlements, as well as under new regulatory requirements, include enhanced mortgage servicing and foreclosure standards and processes. Among other initiatives, the Firm has implemented a new Customer Assistance Specialist organization to serve as a single point of contact for borrowers requiring assistance in the foreclosure or loss mitigation process; implemented specific controls on &#8220;dual tracking&#8221; of foreclosure and loss mitigation activities; strengthened its compliance program to ensure mortgage servicing and foreclosure operations comply with applicable legal requirements; and made technological enhancements to automate and streamline processes for document management, payment processing, training, and skills&#32;assessment. For further information on these settlements and Consent Orders, see Note 2 and Note 31 on pages 192&#8211;194&#32;and pages 326&#8211;332, respectively, of this Annual Report.The mortgage servicing consent order is subject to ongoing oversight by the Mortgage Compliance Committee of the Board, and certain Consent Orders and settlements are the subject of ongoing reporting to various regulators, and the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight (&#8220;OMSO&#8221;).&nbsp;Card, Merchant Services & Auto2013 compared with 2012Card, Merchant Services & Auto&#32;net income was $4.8 billion, an increase of $779 million, or 19%, compared with the prior year, driven by lower provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $18.7 billion, flat compared with the prior year. Net interest income was $13.4&#160;billion, down $309 million, or 2%, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by spread compression in Credit Card and Auto and lower average credit card loan balances, largely offset by the impact of lower revenue reversals associated with lower net charge-offs in Credit Card. Noninterest revenue was $5.3 billion, an increase of $229&#160;million, or 4%, compared with the prior year primarily driven by higher net interchange income, auto lease income and merchant servicing revenue, largely offset by lower revenue from an exited non-core product and a gain on an investment security recognized in the prior year.The provision for credit losses was $2.7&#160;billion, compared with $4.0 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a $1.7 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses reflecting improved delinquency trends and restructured loan performance. The prior-year provision included a $1.6 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The Credit Card net charge-off rate was 3.14%, down from 3.95% in the prior year; and the 30+ day delinquency rate was 1.67%, down from 2.10% in the prior year. The Auto net charge-off rate was 0.31%, down from 0.39% in the prior year.Management's discussion and analysisNoninterest expense was $8.1&#160;billion, a decrease of $138&#160;million, or 2%, from the prior year. This decrease is due to one-time expense items recognized in the prior year related to the exit of a non-core product and the write-off of intangible assets associated with a non-strategic relationship. The reduction in expenses was partially offset by increased auto lease depreciation and payments to customers required by a regulatory Consent Order during 2013.2012 compared with 2011Card, Merchant Services & Auto&#32;net income was $4.0 billion, a decrease of $537 million, or 12%, compared with the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower net revenue and higher provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $18.8 billion, a decrease of $371 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $13.7&#160;billion, down $580 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The decrease was driven by narrower loan spreads and lower average loan balances, partially offset by lower revenue reversals associated with lower net charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $5.1 billion, an increase of $209&#160;million, or 4%, from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net interchange income, including lower partner revenue-sharing due to the impact of the Kohl's portfolio sale on April 1, 2011, and higher merchant servicing revenue, partially offset by higher amortization of loan origination costs.The provision for credit losses was $4.0&#160;billion, compared with $3.6 billion in the prior year. The current-year provision reflected lower net charge-offs and a $1.6 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses due to lower estimated losses. The prior-year provision included a $3.9 billion reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The Credit Card net charge-off rate was 3.95%, down from 5.44% in the prior year; and the 30+ day delinquency rate was 2.10%, down from 2.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate would have been 3.88% absent a policy change on restructured loans that do not comply with their modified payment terms. The Auto net charge-off rate was 0.39%, up from 0.32% in the prior year, including $53 million of charge-offs related to regulatory guidance. Excluding these charge-offs, the net charge-off rate would have been 0.28%.Noninterest expense was $8.2&#160;billion, an increase of $171&#160;million, or 2%, from the prior year, driven by expenses related to a non-core product that is being exited and the write-off of intangible assets associated with a non-strategic relationship, partially offset by lower marketing expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysis&nbsp;CIB provides several non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter 2013) and DVA on: net revenue, net income, compensation ratio, overhead ratio, and return on equity. The ratio for the allowance for loan losses to end-of-period loans is calculated excluding the impact of consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and trade finance, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB's allowance coverage ratio. These measures are used by management to assess the underlying performance of the business and for comparability with peers.2013 compared with 2012Net income was $8.6 billion, up 2% compared with the prior year.Net revenue was $34.2 billion compared with $34.3 billion in the prior year. Net revenue in the current year's fourth quarter included a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation adjustment (&#8220;FVA&#8221;) framework for over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives and structured notes. The FVA framework incorporates the impact of funding into the Firm's valuation estimates for OTC derivatives and structured notes and reflects an industry migration towards incorporating the market cost of unsecured funding in the valuation of such instruments. The loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 is a one-time adjustment arising on implementation of the new FVA framework. In future periods the Firm will incorporate FVA in its estimates of fair value for OTC derivatives and structured notes from the date of initial recognition.Net revenue also included a $452 million loss from debit valuation adjustments (&#8220;DVA&#8221;) on structured notes and derivative liabilities, compared with a loss of $930 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of FVA (effective fourth quarter of 2013) and DVA, net revenue was $36.1 billion and net income was $9.7 billion, compared with $35.3 billion and $9.0 billion in the prior year, respectively.Banking revenues were $12.1 billion, compared with $11.3 billion in the prior year. Investment banking fees were $6.3 billion, up 10% from the prior year, driven by higher equity underwriting fees of $1.5 billion (up 46%) and record debt underwriting fees of $3.5 billion (up 8%), partially offset by lower advisory fees of $1.3 billion (down 12%). Equity underwriting results were driven by higher industry-wide issuance and an increase in the Firm's wallet share compared with the prior year, according to Dealogic. Industry-wide loan syndication volumes and wallet increased as the low rate environment continued to fuel refinancing activity. The Firm also ranked #1 in wallet and volumes shares across high grade, high yield and loan products. Advisory fees were lower compared with the prior year as industry-wide completed M&A wallet declined 13%. The Firm maintained its #2 ranking and improved share for both announced and completed volumes during the period. Treasury Services revenue was $4.1 billion, down 3% compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting lower trade finance spreads, partially offset by higher net interest income on higher deposit balances. Lending revenue was &nbsp;$1.6 billion, up from $1.3 billion, in the prior year reflecting net interest income on retained loans, fees on lending related commitments, as well as gains&#32;on securities received from restructured loans.Markets and Investor Services revenue was $22.2 billion compared to $23.0 billion in the prior year. Combined Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $20.2 billion, up from $19.8 billion the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $15.5 billion was slightly higher reflecting consistently strong client revenue and lower losses from the synthetic credit portfolio, which was partially offset by lower rates-related revenue given an uncertain rate outlook and low spread environment. Equities Markets revenue of $4.8 billion was up 8% compared with the prior year driven by higher revenue in derivatives and cash equities products as well as Prime Services primarily on higher balances. Securities Services revenue was $4.1 billion compared with $4.0 billion in the prior year on higher custody and fund services revenue primarily driven by record assets under custody of $20.5 trillion. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $2.1 billion predominantly driven by FVA (effective the fourth quarter of 2013) and DVA.The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $232 million, compared with a benefit of $479 million in the prior year. The current year benefit reflected lower recoveries as compared to 2012 as the prior year benefited from the restructuring of certain nonperforming loans. Net recoveries were $78 million, compared with $284 million in the prior year reflecting a continued favorable credit environment with stable credit quality trends. Nonperforming loans were down 57% from the prior year.Noninterest expense of $21.7 billion was slightly down compared with the prior year, driven by lower compensation expense, offset by higher non compensation expense related to higher litigation expense as compared to the prior year. The compensation ratio, excluding the impact of DVA and FVA which was effective for the fourth quarter of 2013, was 30% and 32% for 2013 and 2012, respectively.Return on equity was 15% on $56.5 billion of average allocated capital and 17% excluding FVA (effective fourth quarter of 2013) and DVA.2012 compared with 2011Net income was $8.4 billion, up 5% compared with the prior year. These results primarily reflected slightly higher net revenue compared with 2011, lower noninterest expense and a larger benefit from the provision for credit losses. Net revenue was $34.3 billion, compared with $34.0 billion in the prior year. Net revenue included a $930 million loss from DVA on structured notes and derivative liabilities resulting from the tightening of the Firm's credit spreads. Excluding the impact of DVA, net revenue was $35.3 billion and net income was $9.0 billion, compared with $32.5 billion and $7.1 billion in the prior year, respectively.Banking revenues were $11.3 billion, compared with $10.8 billion in the prior year. Investment banking fees were Management's discussion and analysis$5.8&#160;billion, down 2% from the prior year; these consisted of record debt underwriting fees of $3.3&#160;billion (up 13%), advisory fees of $1.5&#160;billion (down 17%) and equity underwriting fees of $1.0&#160;billion (down 13%). Industry-wide debt capital markets volumes were at their second highest annual level since 2006, as the low rate environment continued to fuel issuance and refinancing activity. In contrast there was lower industry-wide announced mergers and acquisitions activity, while industry-wide equity underwriting volumes remained steady. Treasury Services revenue was a record $4.2 billion compared with $3.8 billion in the prior year driven by continued deposit balance growth and higher average trade loans outstanding during the year. Lending revenue was $1.3 billion, compared with $1.1 billion in the prior year due to higher net interest income on increased average retained loans as well as higher fees on lending-related commitments. This was partially offset by higher fair value losses on credit risk-related hedges of the retained loan portfolio.Markets and Investor Services revenue was $23.0 billion compared to $23.2 billion in the prior year. Combined Fixed Income and Equity Markets revenue was $19.8 billion, up from $19.3 billion the prior year as client revenue remained strong across most products, with particular strength in rates-related products, which improved from the prior year. 2012 generally saw credit spread tightening and lower volatility in both the credit and equity markets compared with the prior year, during which macroeconomic concerns, including those in the Eurozone, caused credit spread widening and generally more volatile market conditions, particularly in the second half of the year. Securities Services revenue was $4.0 billion compared with $3.9 billion the prior year primarily driven by higher deposit balances. Assets under custody grew to a record $18.8 trillion by the end of 2012, driven by both market appreciation as well as net inflows. Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $841 million, driven predominantly by DVA, which was a loss of $930 million due to the tightening of the Firm's credit spreads.The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $479 million, compared with a benefit of $285 million in the prior year, as credit trends remained stable. The 2012 benefit reflected recoveries and a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses, both related to the restructuring of certain nonperforming loans, credit trends and other portfolio activities. Net recoveries were $284&#160;million, compared with net charge-offs of $161&#160;million in the prior year. Nonperforming loans were down 35% from the prior year.Noninterest expense was $21.9&#160;billion, down 1%, driven primarily by lower compensation expense.Return on equity was 18% on $47.5&#160;billion of average allocated capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysis&nbsp;income communities, as well as tax-exempt income from municipal bond activity of $407 million, $381 million, and $345 million for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013, 2012&#32;and 2011, respectively.2013 compared with 2012Net income was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $71 million, or 3%, from the prior year, driven by an increase in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in net revenue.Management's discussion and analysisNet revenue was a record $7.0 billion, an increase of $148 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $4.7 billion, up by $133 million, or 3%, driven by higher loan balances and the proceeds from a lending-related workout, partially offset by lower purchase discounts recognized on loan repayments. Noninterest revenue was $2.3 billion, flat compared with the prior year.Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $3.0 billion, an increase of $48 million, or 2%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $1.2 billion, an increase of $21 million, or 2%, from the prior year.

Net charge-offs were $43 million (0.03% net charge-off rate) compared with net charge-offs of $35 million (0.03% net charge-off rate) in 2012. Nonaccrual loans were $514 million, down by $159 million, or 24%, due to repayments. The allowance for loan losses to period-end retained loans was 1.97%, down slightly from 2.06%.Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, an increase of $221 million, or 9%, from the prior year, reflecting higher product- and headcount-related expense.2012 compared with 2011Record net income was $2.6 billion, an increase of $279 million, or 12%, from the prior year. The improvement was driven by an increase in net revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.Net revenue was a record $6.8 billion, an increase of $407 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $4.5 billion, up by $319 million, or 8%, driven by growth in loans and client deposits, partially offset by spread compression. Loan growth was strong across all client segments and industries. Noninterest revenue was $2.3 billion, up by $88 million, or 4%, compared with the prior year, largely driven by increased investment banking revenue.&nbsp;Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $3.0 billion, an increase of $168 million, or 6%, from the prior year driven by higher loans and client deposits, partially offset by lower spreads from lending and deposit products. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending was $1.2 billion, an increase of $26 million, or 2%.

Net charge-offs were $35 million (0.03% net charge-off rate) compared with net charge-offs of $187 million (0.18% net charge-off rate) in 2011. The decrease in the provision and net charge-offs was largely driven by improving trends in the credit quality of the portfolio. Nonaccrual loans were $673 million, down by $380 million, or 36%, due to repayments and loan sales. The allowance for loan losses to period-end retained loans was 2.06%, down from 2.34%.Noninterest expense was $2.4 billion, an increase of $111 million, or 5%, from the prior year, reflecting higher compensation expense driven by expansion, portfolio growth and increased regulatory requirements.&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysis2013 compared with 2012 Net income was $2.0 billion, an increase of $328 million, or 19%, from the prior year, reflecting higher net revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense.Net revenue was $11.3 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 14%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $9.0 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 15%, from the prior year, due to net client inflows, the effect of higher market levels and higher performance fees.

Revenue from Retail was $2.8 billion, up 30% due to net client inflows and the effect of higher market levels. Revenue from Institutional was $2.5 billion, up 6% due to higher valuations of seed capital investments, the effect of higher market levels and higher performance fees. The provision for credit losses was $65 million, compared with $86 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $8.0 billion, an increase of $912 million, or 13%, from the prior year, primarily due to higher headcount-related expense driven by continued front office expansion efforts, higher performance-based compensation and costs related to the control agenda.2012 compared with 2011Net income was $1.7 billion, an increase of $111 million, or 7%, from the prior year. These results reflected higher net revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses.Net revenue was $9.9 billion, an increase of $403 million, or 4%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $7.8 billion, down $48 million, or 1%, due to lower loan-related revenue and the absence of a prior-year gain on the sale of an investment. These decreases were predominantly offset by net client inflows, higher valuations of seed capital investments, the effect of higher market levels, higher brokerage revenue and higher performance fees.

The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm's four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.&#32;CIO achieves the Firm's asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm's AFS and HTM investment securities portfolios (the &#8220;investment securities portfolio&#8221;). CIO also uses derivatives, as well as securities that are not classified as AFS or HTM, to meet the Firm's asset-liability management objectives. For further information on derivatives, see Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report. For further information about securities not classified within the AFS or HTM portfolio, see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report. The Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities. At December 31, 2013, the total Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was $347.6 billion; the average credit rating of the securities comprising the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings that correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). See Note 12 on pages 249&#8211;254&#32;of this Annual Report for further information on the details of the Firm's investment securities portfolio.For further information on liquidity and funding risk, see Liquidity Risk Management on pages&#32;168&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report.

The decrease in the portfolio was predominantly driven by sales of investments, partially offset by new investments and unrealized gains.2012 compared with 2011The carrying value of the private equity portfolio at December 31, 2012 was $8.1 billion, up from $7.7 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase in the portfolio was predominantly driven by new investments and unrealized gains, partially offset by sales of investments.Management's discussion and analysisDuring the years ended December&#160;31, 2013, 2012&#32;and 2011, the Firm recorded $24.0 billion, $18.5 billion&#32;and $24.5 billion, respectively, of managed revenue derived from clients, customers and counterparties domiciled outside of North America. Of those amounts, 65%, 57%&#32;and 66%, respectively, were derived from Europe/Middle &nbsp;East/Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); 26%, 30%&#32;and 25%, respectively, from Asia/Pacific; and 9%, 13%&#32;and 9%, respectively, from Latin America/Caribbean. For additional information regarding international operations, see Note 32 on page 333&#32;of this Annual Report.International wholesale activitiesThe Firm is committed to meeting the needs of its clients as part of a coordinated international business strategy.Set forth below are certain key metrics related to the Firm's wholesale international operations, including, for each of EMEA, Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean, the number of countries in each such region in which they operate, front-office headcount, number of significant clients, revenue and selected balance-sheet data.Note: International wholesale operations is comprised of CIB, AM, CB and Treasury and CIO.Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase's business activities. The Firm employs a holistic approach to risk management that is intended to ensure the broad spectrum of risk types are considered in managing its business activities.The Firm believes effective risk management requires: Firmwide Risk Management is overseen and managed on an enterprise-wide basis. The Firm's Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;), Chief Financial Officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;), Chief Risk Officer (&#8220;CRO&#8221;) and Chief Operating Officer (&#8220;COO&#8221;) develop and set the risk management framework and governance structure for the Firm which is intended to provide comprehensive controls and ongoing management of the major risks inherent in the Firm's business activities. The &nbsp;Firm's risk management framework is intended to create a culture of risk transparency and awareness, and personal responsibility throughout the Firm where collaboration, discussion, escalation and sharing of information are encouraged. The CEO, CFO, CRO and COO are ultimately responsible and accountable to the Firm's Board of Director's.The Firm believes that risk management is the responsibility of every employee. Employees are expected to operate with the highest standards of integrity and identify, escalate, and correct mistakes. The Firm's risk culture strives for continual improvement through ongoing employee training and development, as well as talent retention. The Firm also approaches its incentive compensation arrangements through an integrated risk, compensation and financial management framework to encourage a culture of risk awareness and personal accountability. The Firm's overall objective in managing risk is to protect the safety and soundness of the Firm, and avoid excessive risk taking.Management's discussion and analysisThe following sections outline the key risks that are inherent in the Firm's business activities.Risk governance and oversight The Board of Directors provides oversight of risk principally through the Board of Directors' Risk Policy Committee (&#8220;DRPC&#8221;), Audit Committee and, with respect to compensation, Compensation & Management Development Committee. The Firm's overall risk appetite is established by management taking into consideration the Firm's capital and liquidity positions, earnings power, and diversified business model. The risk appetite framework is a tool to measure the capacity to take risk and is expressed in loss tolerance parameters at the Firm and/or LOB levels, including net income loss tolerances, liquidity limits and market limits. Performance against these parameters informs management's strategic decisions and is reported to the DRPC.&nbsp;The Firm-level risk appetite parameters are set and approved by the Firm's CEO, CFO, CRO and COO. LOB-level risk appetite parameters are set by the LOB CEO, CFO, and CRO and are approved by the Firm's functional heads as noted above. Firmwide LOB diversification allows the sum of the LOBs' loss tolerances to be greater than the Firmwide loss tolerance. The CRO is responsible for the overall direction of the Firm's Risk Management function and is the head of the Risk Management Organization. The LOBs and legal entities are ultimately responsible for managing the risks inherent in their respective business activities. The Firm's Risk Management Organization and other Firmwide functions with risk-related responsibilities (i.e., Regulatory Capital Management Office (&#8220;RCMO&#8221;), Oversight and Control Group, Valuation Control Group (&#8220;VCG&#8221;), Legal and Compliance) provide independent oversight of the monitoring, evaluation and escalation of risk. The chart below illustrates the Firm's Risk Governance structure and certain key management level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions; there are additional committees not represented in the chart (e.g. Firmwide Fiduciary Risk Committee, and other functional forums) that are also responsible for management and oversight of risk. Additionally, the chart illustrates how the primary escalation mechanism works.In assisting the Board in its oversight of risk, primary responsibility with respect to credit risk, market risk, structural interest rate risk, principal risk, liquidity risk, country risk, fiduciary risk and model risk rests with the DRPC, while primary responsibility with respect to operating risk, legal risk and compliance risk rests with the Audit Committee. Each committee of the Board oversees reputation risk issues within its scope of responsibility.The Directors' Risk Policy Committee (&#8220;DRPC&#8221;) assists the Board in its oversight of management's exercise of its responsibility to (i) assess and manage the Firm's risk; (ii) ensure that there is in place an effective system reasonably designed to evaluate and control such risks throughout the Firm; and (iii) manage capital and liquidity planning and analysis. The DRPC reviews and approves Primary Risk Policies (as designated by the DRPC), reviews firmwide value-at-risk, stress limits and any other metrics agreed to with management, and performance against such metrics. The Firm's CRO, LOB CROs, LOB CEOs, heads of risk for Country Risk, Market Risk, Wholesale Credit Risk, Consumer Credit Risk, Model Risk, Risk Management Policy, Reputation Risk Governance, Fiduciary Risk Governance, and Operational Risk Governance (all referred to as Firmwide Risk Executives) meet with and provide updates and escalations to the DRPC. Additionally, breaches in risk &nbsp;appetite tolerances, liquidity issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm and other significant matters as determined by the CRO or Firmwide functions with risk responsibility are escalated to the DRPC. The Audit Committee&#32;assists the Board in its oversight of guidelines and policies that govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews with management the system of internal control that is relied upon to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the Firm's execution of operational risk. In addition, Internal Audit, an independent function within the Firm that provides independent and objective assessments of the control environment, reports directly to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO. Internal Audit conducts independent reviews to&#32;evaluate the Firm's internal control structure and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and is responsible for providing the Audit Committee, senior management and regulators with an independent assessment of the Firm's ability to manage and control risk.The Compensation & Management Development Committee, assists the Board in its oversight of the Firm's compensation programs and reviews and approves the Firm's overall compensation philosophy and practices. The Committee Management's discussion and analysisreviews the Firm's compensation practices as they relate to risk and risk management in light of the Firm's objectives, including its safety and soundness and the avoidance of excessive risk taking. The Committee reviews and approves the terms of compensation award programs, including recovery provisions, restrictive covenants and vesting periods. The Committee also reviews and approves the Firm's overall incentive compensation pools and reviews those of each of the Firm's lines of business and Corporate/Private Equity segment. The Committee reviews the performance and approves all compensation awards for the Firm's Operating Committee on a name-by-name basis. The full Board's independent directors review the performance and approve the compensation of the Firm's CEO.Among the Firm's management level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions are:The Asset-Liability Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;),&#32;chaired by the Corporate Treasurer under the direction of the COO, monitors the Firm's overall liquidity risk. ALCO is responsible for reviewing and approving the Firm's liquidity policy and contingency funding plan. ALCO also reviews the Firm's funds transfer pricing policy (through which lines of business &#8220;transfer&#8221; interest rate and foreign exchange risk to Treasury), overall structural interest rate risk position, funding requirements and strategy, and the Firm's securitization programs (and any required liquidity support by the Firm of such programs).The Capital Governance Committee,&#32;chaired by the Firm's CFO, is responsible for reviewing the Firm's Capital Management Policy and the principles underlying capital issuance and distribution alternatives. The Committee is also responsible for governing the capital adequacy assessment process, including overall design, assumptions and risk streams; and, ensuring that capital stress test programs are designed to adequately capture the idiosyncratic risks across the Firm's businesses.The Firmwide Risk Committee (&#8220;FRC&#8221;)&#32;provides oversight of the risks inherent in the Firm's businesses, including market, credit, principal, structural interest rate, operational risk framework, fiduciary, reputational, country, liquidity and model risks. The Committee is co-chaired by the Firm's CEO and CRO. Members of the committee include the the Firm's COO, LOB CEOs, LOB CROs, General Counsel, and other senior managers from risk and control functions. This committee serves as an escalation point for risk topics and issues raised by the Firm's Operating Committee, the Line of Business Risk Committees, Firmwide Control Committee (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) and other subordinate committees. The Firmwide Control Committee (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) provides a forum for senior management to review and discuss firmwide operational risks including existing and emerging issues, as well as operational risk metrics, management and execution. The FCC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised from LOB and Functional Control Committees, particularly those with potential enterprise-wide impact. The FCC (as well as the LOB and Functional Control Committees) oversees the risk and control environment, which includes reviewing the identification, management and monitoring of operational risk, control issues, remediation actions and enterprise-wide trends. The FCC escalates significant issues to the FRC.&nbsp;Each LOB Risk Committee is responsible for decisions relating to risk strategy, policy, measurement and control within its respective LOB. The committee is co-chaired by the LOB CRO and LOB CEO or equivalent. The committee has a clear set of escalation rules and it is the responsibility of committee members to escalate line of business risk topics to the Firmwide Risk Committee as appropriate.Other corporate functions and forums with risk management-related responsibilities include: The Firm's Oversight and Control Group is comprised of dedicated control officers within each of the lines of business and Corporate functional areas, as well as a central oversight team.&#160;The group is charged with enhancing the Firm's controls by looking within and across the lines of business and&#160;Corporate functional areas to identify and control issues. The group enables the Firm to detect control problems more quickly, escalate issues promptly and get the right people involved to understand common themes and interdependencies among the various parts of the Firm. The group works closely with the Firm's other control-related functions, including Compliance, Legal, Internal Audit and Risk Management, to effectively remediate identified control issues across all affected areas of the Firm. As a result, the group facilitates the effective execution of the Firm's control framework and helps support operational risk management across the Firm.The Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (&#8220;VGF&#8221;) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The VGF is chaired by the firmwide head of the Valuation Control function (under the direction of the Firm's CFO), and also includes sub-forums for the CIB, Mortgage Bank, and certain corporate functions, including Treasury and CIO.In addition to the committees, forums and groups listed above, the Firm has other management committees and forums at the LOB and regional levels, where risk-related topics are discussed and escalated as necessary. The membership of these committees is composed of senior management of the Firm including representation from the business and various control functions. The committees meet regularly to discuss a broad range of topics. The JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. The JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Board accomplishes this function acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm's Board of Directors. Risk oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Firm's DRPC, Audit Committee and, with respect to compensation-related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee.Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. The Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its residential real estate, credit card, auto, business banking and student lending businesses. Originated mortgage loans are retained in the mortgage portfolio, or securitized or sold to U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of consumer loans are typically retained on balance sheet. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending and derivatives activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities, such as cash management and clearing activities. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm's wholesale businesses are generally retained on the balance sheet; the Firm's syndicated loan business distributes a significant percentage of originations into the market and is an important component of portfolio management.Credit risk organizationCredit risk management is overseen by the Chief Risk Officer and implemented within the lines of business. The Firm's credit risk management governance consists of the following activities:Risk identification and measurementCredit Risk Management works in partnership with the business segments in identifying and aggregating exposures across all lines of business. To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower's credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.Based on these factors and related market-based inputs, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. Probable credit losses inherent in the consumer and wholesale loan &nbsp;portfolios are reflected in the allowance for loan losses, and probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments are reflected in the allowance for lending-related commitments. These losses are estimated using statistical analyses and other factors as described in Note 15 on pages 284&#8211;287&#32;of this Annual Report. In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing (considering alternative economic scenarios) as described in the Stress Testing section below.The methodologies used to estimate credit losses depend on the characteristics of the credit exposure, as described below.Scored exposureThe scored portfolio is generally held in CCB and includes residential real estate loans, credit card loans, certain auto and business banking loans, and student loans. For the scored portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on statistical analysis of credit losses over discrete periods of time and are estimated using portfolio modeling, credit scoring, and decision-support tools, which consider loan level factors such as delinquency status, credit scores, collateral values, and other risk factors. Credit loss analyses also consider, as appropriate, uncertainties and other factors, including those related to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the quality of underwriting standards, and other internal and external factors. The factors and analysis are updated on a quarterly basis or more frequently as market conditions dictate.Risk-rated exposureRisk-rated portfolios are generally held in CIB, CB and AM, but also include certain business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB that are risk-rated because they have characteristics similar to commercial loans. For the risk-rated portfolio, credit loss estimates are based on estimates of the probability of default and loss severity given a default. The estimation process begins with risk-ratings that are assigned to each loan facility to differentiate risk within the portfolio. These risk-ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis by Credit Risk management and revised as needed to reflect the borrower's current financial position, risk profile and related collateral. The probability of default is the likelihood that a loan will default and not be fully repaid by the borrower. The probability of default is estimated for each borrower, and a loss given default is estimated considering the collateral and structural support for each credit facility. The calculations and assumptions are based on management information systems and methodologies that are under continual review.Management's discussion and analysisStress testingStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm's credit portfolio. The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, and the stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform our decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and line of business level, as well as for assessing the impact of stress on industry concentrations.Risk monitoring and managementThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the line of businesses.For consumer credit risk, delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, are monitored, as certain of these trends can be modified through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Loss mitigation strategies are employed for all residential real estate portfolios. These strategies include interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions, principal and interest deferral and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and avoid foreclosure. Historical and forecasted trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio. Under the Firm's model risk policy, new significant risk management models, as well as major changes to such models, are required to be reviewed and approved by the Model Review Group prior to implementation into the operating environment. Internal Audit also periodically tests the internal controls around the modeling process including the integrity of the data utilized. For a discussion of the Model Review Group, see page 153&#32;of this Annual Report. For further discussion of consumer loans, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry and individual counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised, as deemed appropriate by management, typically on an annual basis. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic credit risk capital, are subject to stress-based loss constraints.Management of the Firm's wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means including:In addition to Risk Management, Internal Audit performs periodic exams, as well as continuous review, where appropriate, of the Firm's consumer and wholesale portfolios. For risk-rated portfolios, a credit review group within Internal Audit is responsible for:Risk reportingTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, customer, product and geographic concentrations occurs monthly, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, senior management and the Board of Directors as appropriate.2013&#32;Credit Risk Overview The credit environment in 2013&#32;continued to improve, with reduced concerns around the European financial crisis and improving market conditions in the U.S. Over the course of the year, the Firm continued to actively manage its underperforming and nonaccrual loans and reduce such exposures through repayments, loan sales and workouts. The Firm saw decreased downgrade, default and charge-off activity and improved consumer delinquency trends. The Firm increased its overall lending activity driven by the wholesale businesses. The combination of these factors resulted in an improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio compared with 2012&#32;and contributed to the Firm's reduction in the allowance for credit losses. For further discussion of the consumer credit environment and consumer loans, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;and Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report. For further discussion of wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans, see Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 130&#8211;138&#32;and Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.The following tables present the Firm's credit-related information with respect to its credit portfolio. Total credit exposure was $1.9 trillion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, an increase of $2.2 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, reflecting an increase in the wholesale portfolio of $13.7 billion&#32;offset by a decrease in the consumer portfolio of $11.5 billion. For further information on the changes in the credit portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129, and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 130&#8211;138, of this Annual Report.In the following tables, reported loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale (which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue); and certain loans accounted for at fair value. In addition, the Firm records certain loans accounted for at fair value in trading assets. For further information regarding these loans see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report. For additional information on the Firm's loans and derivative receivables, including the Firm's accounting policies, see Note 14 and Note 6 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;and 220&#8211;233, respectively, of this Annual Report.For further information regarding the credit risk inherent in the Firm's investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 on pages 249&#8211;254&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, business banking loans, and student loans. The Firm's focus is on serving the prime segment of the consumer credit market. For further information on consumer loans, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.A substantial portion of the consumer loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction were identified as purchased credit-impaired (&#8220;PCI&#8221;) based on an analysis of high-risk characteristics, including product type, loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios, FICO risk scores and delinquency status. These PCI loans are accounted for on a pool basis, and the pools are considered to be performing. For further information on PCI loans see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to improve as the economy slowly expands and home prices improve. Loss rates are improving, particularly in the credit card and residential real estate portfolios. Early-stage residential real estate delinquencies (30&#8211;89 days delinquent), excluding government guaranteed loans, declined from December&#160;31, 2012. Late-stage delinquencies (150+ days delinquent) continued to decline but remain elevated. The elevated level of the late-stage delinquent loans is due, in part, to loss mitigation activities currently being undertaken and to elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Losses related to these loans continue to be recognized in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off practices, but some delinquent loans that would otherwise have been foreclosed upon remain in the mortgage and home equity loan portfolios.The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the credit portfolio held by CCB as well as for prime mortgage loans held in the Asset Management and the Corporate/Private Equity segments for the dates indicated. For further information about the Firm's nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisConsumer, excluding credit cardPortfolio analysisConsumer loan balances declined during the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, due to paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans, partially offset by new mortgage and auto originations. Credit performance has improved across most portfolios but residential real estate charge-offs and delinquent loans remain elevated compared with pre-recessionary levels.The following discussion relates to the specific loan and lending-related categories. PCI loans are generally excluded from individual loan product discussions and are addressed separately below. For further information about the Firm's consumer portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.Home equity:&#32;The home equity portfolio at December&#160;31, 2013, was $57.9 billion, compared with $67.4 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease in this portfolio primarily reflected loan paydowns and charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies showed improvement from December&#160;31, 2012, for both senior and junior lien home equity loans. Late-stage delinquencies also improved from December&#160;31, 2012, but continue to be elevated as improvement in the number of loans becoming severely delinquent was offset by higher average carrying value on these loans, reflecting improving collateral values. Senior lien nonaccrual loans were flat compared with the prior year while junior lien nonaccrual loans decreased in 2013. Net charge-offs for both senior and junior lien home equity loans declined when compared with the prior year as a result of improvement in delinquencies and home prices, as well as the impact of prior year incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.Approximately 20%&#32;of the Firm's home equity portfolio consists of home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) and the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3&#8211;30 years. Approximately half of the HELOANs are senior liens and the remainder are junior liens. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC recasts into a loan with a 20-year amortization period. At the time of origination, the borrower typically selects one of two minimum payment &nbsp;options that will generally remain in effect during the revolving period: a monthly payment of 1% of the outstanding balance, or interest-only payments based on a variable index (typically Prime). HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan's term.The unpaid principal balance of non-PCI HELOCs outstanding was $50 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013. Based on the contractual terms of the loans, $30 billion&#32;of the non-PCI HELOCs outstanding are scheduled to recast at which time the borrower must begin to make fully amortizing payments, of which, $7 billion, $8 billion&#32;and $7 billion&#32;are scheduled to recast in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, of the $30 billion&#32;in non-PCI HELOCs scheduled to recast, approximately $14 billion&#32;are currently expected to recast, with the remaining $16 billion&#32;representing loans to borrowers who are expected to prepay (including borrowers who appear to have the ability to refinance based on the borrower's LTV ratio and FICO score) or are loans that are expected to charge-off. The Firm has considered this payment recast risk in its allowance for loan losses based upon the estimated amount of payment shock (i.e., the excess of the fully-amortizing payment over the interest-only payment in effect prior to recast) expected to occur at the payment recast date, along with the corresponding estimated probability of default and loss severity assumptions. Certain factors, such as future developments in both unemployment and home prices, could have a significant impact on the expected and/or actual performance of these loans.The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile or when the collateral does not support the loan amount. The Firm will continue to evaluate both the near-term and longer-term repricing and recast risks inherent in its HELOC portfolio to ensure that changes in the Firm's estimate of incurred losses are appropriately considered in the allowance for loan losses and that the Firm's account management practices are appropriate given the portfolio's risk profile.At December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm estimated that its home equity portfolio contained approximately $2.3 billion&#32;of current junior lien loans where the borrower has a first mortgage loan that is either delinquent or has been modified (&#8220;high-risk seconds&#8221;), compared with $3.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Such loans are considered to pose a higher risk of default than that of junior lien loans for which the senior lien is neither delinquent nor modified. The Firm estimates the balance of its total exposure to high-risk seconds on a quarterly basis using internal data and loan level credit bureau data (which typically provides the delinquency status of the senior lien). The estimated balance of these high-risk seconds may vary from quarter to quarter for reasons such as the movement of related senior liens into and out of the 30+ day delinquency bucket.Of the estimated $2.3 billion&#32;of high-risk junior liens at December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm owns approximately 5%&#32;and services approximately 25%&#32;of the related senior lien loans to the same borrowers. The performance of the Firm's junior lien loans is generally consistent regardless of whether the Firm owns, services or does not own or service the senior lien. The increased probability of default associated with these higher-risk junior lien loans was considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.Mortgage:&#32;Mortgage loans at December&#160;31, 2013, including prime, subprime and loans held-for-sale, were $94.9 billion, compared with $84.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The mortgage portfolio increased in 2013 as retained prime mortgage originations, which represent loans with high credit quality, were greater than paydowns and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs decreased from the prior year reflecting continued home price improvement and favorable delinquency trends. Delinquency levels remain elevated compared with pre-recessionary levels.Prime mortgages, including option adjustable-rate mortgages (&#8220;ARMs&#8221;) and loans held-for-sale, were $87.8 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with $76.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Prime mortgage loans increased as retained originations exceeded paydowns, the run-off of option ARM loans and the charge-off or liquidation of delinquent loans. Excluding loans insured by U.S. government agencies, both early-stage and late-stage delinquencies showed improvement from December&#160;31, 2012. Nonaccrual loans decreased from the prior year but remain elevated as a result of elongated foreclosure processing timelines. Net charge-offs continued to improve, as a result of improvement in delinquencies and home prices.&nbsp;At December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm's prime mortgage portfolio included $14.3 billion&#32;and $15.6 billion, respectively, of mortgage loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, of which $9.6 billion&#32;and $11.8 billion, respectively, were 30 days or more past due, including $8.4 billion&#32;and $10.6 billion, respectively, which were 90 days or more past due. Following the Firm's settlement regarding loans insured under federal mortgage insurance programs overseen by FHA, HUD, and VA, the Firm will continue to monitor exposure on future claim payments for government insured loans; however, any financial impact related to exposure on future claims is not expected to be significant.At December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm's prime mortgage portfolio included $15.6 billion&#32;and $16.0 billion, respectively, of interest-only loans, which represented 18%&#32;and 21%&#32;of the prime mortgage portfolio, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The decrease in this portfolio was primarily due to voluntary prepayments, as borrowers are generally refinancing into lower rate products. To date, losses on this portfolio generally have been consistent with the broader prime mortgage portfolio and the Firm's expectations. The Firm continues to monitor the risks associated with these loans.Non-PCI option ARM loans acquired by the Firm as part of the Washington Mutual transaction, which are included in the prime mortgage portfolio, were $5.6 billion&#32;and $6.5 billion&#32;and represented 6%&#32;and 9%&#32;of the prime mortgage portfolio at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. The decrease in option ARM loans resulted from portfolio runoff. As of December&#160;31, 2013, approximately 4%&#32;of option ARM borrowers were delinquent. Substantially all of the remaining borrowers were making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing and may be subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM loans will undergo a payment recast that results in a payment increase: $807 million&#32;in 2014, $675 million&#32;in 2015&#32;and $164 million&#32;in 2016. As the Firm's option ARM loans, other than those held in the PCI portfolio, are primarily loans with lower LTV ratios and higher borrower FICO scores, it is possible that many of these borrowers will be able to refinance into a lower rate product, which would reduce this payment recast risk. To date, losses realized on option ARM loans that have undergone payment recast have been immaterial and consistent with the Firm's expectations.Subprime mortgages at December&#160;31, 2013, were $7.1 billion, compared with $8.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease was due to portfolio runoff. Early-stage and late-stage delinquencies as well as nonaccrual loans have improved from December&#160;31, 2012, but remain at elevated Management's discussion and analysislevels. Net charge-offs continued to improve as a result of improvement in delinquencies and home prices.Auto: Auto loans at December&#160;31, 2013, were $52.8 billion, compared with $49.9 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Loan balances increased due to new originations, partially offset by paydowns and payoffs. Delinquencies and nonaccrual loans improved compared with December&#160;31, 2012. Net charge-offs decreased from the prior year due to prior year incremental charge-offs reported in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Loss levels are considered low as a result of favorable trends in both loss frequency and loss severity, mainly due to enhanced underwriting standards and a strong used car market. The auto loan portfolio reflected a high concentration of prime-quality credits.Business banking: Business banking loans at December&#160;31, 2013, were $19.0 billion, compared with $18.9 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Business Banking loans primarily include loans that are collateralized, often with personal loan guarantees, and may also include Small Business Administration guarantees. Nonaccrual loans showed improvement from December&#160;31, 2012. Net charge-offs declined for the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, compared with the year ended December&#160;31, 2012.Student and other: Student and other loans at December&#160;31, 2013, were $11.6 billion, compared with $12.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to runoff of the student loan portfolio. Other loans primarily include other secured and unsecured consumer loans. Nonaccrual loans increased compared with December&#160;31, 2012, while net charge-offs decreased for the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, compared with the prior year.Purchased credit-impaired loans: PCI loans at December&#160;31, 2013, were $53.1 billion, compared with $59.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. This portfolio represents loans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction, which were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. PCI HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual were generally revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to an interest-only loan with a balloon payment at the end of the loan's term. Substantially all undrawn HELOCs within the revolving period have been blocked.As of December&#160;31, 2013, approximately 19%&#32;of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately 54%&#32;have been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. Substantially all of the remaining loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans are subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm's &nbsp;quarterly impairment assessment. The cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option ARM PCI pool was $724 million&#32;and $879 million&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively. The Firm estimates the following balances of option ARM PCI loans will undergo a payment recast that results in a payment increase: $487 million&#32;in 2014, $810 million&#32;in 2015&#32;and $710 million&#32;in 2016.The following table provides a summary of lifetime principal loss estimates included in both the nonaccretable difference and the allowance for loan losses.Lifetime principal&#32;loss estimates declined from December&#160;31, 2012, to December&#160;31, 2013, reflecting improvement in home prices and delinquencies. The decline in lifetime principal loss estimates during the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, resulted in a $1.5 billion&#32;reduction of the PCI allowance for loan losses ($1.0 billion&#32;related to option ARM loans, $200 million&#32;to subprime mortgage, $150 million&#32;to home equity loans and $150 million&#32;to prime mortgage). In addition, for the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, PCI write-offs of $53 million&#32;were recorded against the prime mortgage allowance for loan losses. For further information about the Firm's PCI loans, including write-offs, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.As a result of reserve actions and PCI prime mortgage write-offs, the allowance for loan loss for the PCI portfolio declined from $5.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, to $4.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013. The allowance for loan losses decreased from $1.5 billion&#32;to $494 million&#32;for the option ARM portfolio, from $1.9 billion&#32;to $1.7 billion&#32;for prime mortgage, from $380 million&#32;to $180 million&#32;for subprime mortgage and from $1.9 billion&#32;to $1.8 billion&#32;for the home equity portfolio from December&#160;31, 2012&#32;to December&#160;31, 2013.Geographic composition of residential real estate loansAt December&#160;31, 2013, California had the greatest concentration of residential real estate loans with 25%&#32;of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, compared with 24%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Of these loans, $85.9 billion, or 62%, were concentrated in California, New York, Illinois, Florida and Texas at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with $82.4 billion, or 60%, at December&#160;31, 2012. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans concentrated in these five states represented 74%&#32;of total PCI loans at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with 73%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012.Current estimated LTVs of residential real estate loansThe current estimated average LTV ratio for residential real estate loans retained, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies and PCI loans, was 75%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with 81%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. Of these loans, 9%&#32;had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 2%&#32;had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 125% at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with 20%&#32;and 8%, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2012.&nbsp;Although home prices continue to recover, the decline in home prices since 2007 has had a significant impact on the collateral values underlying the Firm's residential real estate loan portfolio. In general, the delinquency rate for loans with high LTV ratios is greater than the delinquency rate for loans in which the borrower has equity in the collateral. While a large portion of the loans with current estimated LTV ratios greater than 100% continue to pay and are current, the continued willingness and ability of these borrowers to pay remains a risk.Management's discussion and analysisThe following table for PCI loans presents the current estimated LTV ratios, as well as the ratios of the carrying value of the underlying loans to the current estimated collateral value. Because such loans were initially measured at fair value, the ratios of the carrying value to the current estimated collateral value will be lower than the current estimated LTV ratios, which are based on the unpaid principal balances. The estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.The current estimated average LTV ratios were 85%&#32;and 103%&#32;for California and Florida PCI loans, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with 110%&#32;and 125%, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2012. Average LTV ratios have declined consistent with recent improvement in home prices. Although home prices have improved, home prices in California and Florida are still lower than at the peak of the housing market; this continues to negatively contribute to current estimated average LTV ratios and the ratio of net carrying value to current estimated collateral value for loans in the PCI portfolio. Of the total PCI portfolio, 26%&#32;had a current estimated LTV ratio greater than 100%, and 7%&#32;had a current LTV ratio of greater than 125% at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with 55%&#32;and 24%, respectively, at December&#160;31, 2012.While the current estimated collateral value is greater than the net carrying value of PCI loans, the ultimate performance of this portfolio is highly dependent on borrowers' behavior and ongoing ability and willingness to continue to make payments on homes with negative equity, as well as on the cost of alternative housing. For further information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of residential real estate &#8211; non-PCI and PCI loans, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.Loan modification activities &#8211; residential real estate loansFor both the Firm's on&#8211;balance sheet loans and loans serviced for others, more than 1.5 million&#32;mortgage modifications have been offered to borrowers and approximately 734,000&#32;have been approved since the beginning of 2009. Of these, more than 725,000&#32;have achieved permanent modification as of December&#160;31, &nbsp;2013. Of the remaining modifications offered, 9%&#32;are in a trial period or still being reviewed for a modification, while 91%&#32;have dropped out of the modification program or otherwise were deemed not eligible for final modification.The Firm is participating in the U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;) programs and is continuing to offer its other loss-mitigation programs to financially distressed borrowers who do not qualify for the U.S. Treasury's programs. The MHA programs include the Home Affordable Modification Program (&#8220;HAMP&#8221;) and the Second Lien Modification Program (&#8220;2MP&#8221;). The Firm's other loss-mitigation programs for troubled borrowers who do not qualify for HAMP include the traditional modification programs offered by the GSEs and other governmental agencies, as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, which include concessions similar to those offered under HAMP and 2MP but with expanded eligibility criteria. In addition, the Firm has offered specific targeted modification programs to higher risk borrowers, many of whom were current on their mortgages prior to modification. For further information about how loans are modified, see Note 14, Loan modifications, on pages 268&#8211;273&#32;of this Annual Report.Loan modifications under HAMP and under one of the Firm's proprietary modification programs, which are largely modeled after HAMP, require at least three payments to be made under the new terms during a trial modification period, and must be successfully re-underwritten with income verification before the loan can be permanently modified. In the case of specific targeted modification programs, re-underwriting the loan or a trial modification period is generally not required, unless the targeted loan is delinquent at the time of modification. When the Firm modifies home equity lines of credit, future lending commitments related to the modified loans are canceled as part of the terms of the modification.The primary indicator used by management to monitor the success of the modification programs is the rate at which the modified loans redefault. Modification redefault rates are affected by a number of factors, including the type of loan modified, the borrower's overall ability and willingness to repay the modified loan and macroeconomic factors. Reduction in payment size for a borrower has shown to be the most significant driver in improving redefault rates.The performance of modified loans generally differs by product type and also on whether the underlying loan is in the PCI portfolio, due both to differences in credit quality and in the types of modifications provided. Performance metrics for modifications to the residential real estate portfolio, excluding PCI loans, that have been seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 20%&#32;for senior lien home equity, 20%&#32;for junior lien home equity, 15%&#32;for prime mortgages including option ARMs, and 26%&#32;for subprime mortgages. The cumulative performance metrics for modifications to the PCI residential real estate portfolio seasoned more than six months show weighted average redefault rates of 20%&#32;for home equity, 16%&#32;for prime mortgages, 14%&#32;for option ARMs and 29%&#32;for subprime mortgages. The favorable performance of the PCI option ARM modifications is the result of a targeted proactive program which fixes the borrower's payment at the current level. The cumulative redefault rates reflect the performance of modifications completed under both HAMP and the Firm's proprietary modification programs from October 1, 2009, through December&#160;31, 2013.Certain loans that were modified under HAMP and the Firm's proprietary modification programs (primarily the Firm's modification program that was modeled after HAMP) have interest rate reset provisions (&#8220;step-rate modifications&#8221;). Beginning in 2014, interest rates on these loans will generally increase by 1% per year until the rate reaches a specified cap, typically at a prevailing market interest rate for a fixed-rate loan as of the modification date. The carrying value of non-PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications was $5 billion at December 31, 2013, with $1 billion and $2 billion scheduled to experience the initial interest rate increase in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The unpaid principal balance of PCI loans modified in step-rate modifications was $11 billion at December 31, 2013, with $2 billion and $3 billion scheduled to experience the initial interest rate increase in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The impact of these potential interest rate increases is appropriately considered in the Firm's allowance for loan losses.&#160;The Firm will continue to monitor this risk exposure to ensure that it is appropriately considered in the Firm's allowance for loan losses.&nbsp;&#32;The following table presents information as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, relating to modified on&#8211;balance sheet residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications of PCI loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans, and the impact of the modification is incorporated into the Firm's quarterly assessment of estimated future cash flows. Modifications of consumer loans other than PCI loans are generally accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;). For further information on TDRs for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisNonperforming assetsThe following table presents information as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.Nonaccrual loans: The following table presents changes in the consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the years ended&#32;December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012.Nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolio totaled&#32;$6.9 billion&#32;at&#32;December&#160;31, 2013, of which&#32;34%&#32;were greater than 150 days past due, compared with&#32;$8.5 billion&#32;at&#32;December&#160;31, 2012, of which&#32;42%&#32;were greater than 150 days past due. In the aggregate, the unpaid principal balance of residential real estate loans greater &nbsp;than 150 days past due was charged down by approximately 51%&#32;and 52%&#32;to estimated net realizable value of the collateral at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively. The elongated foreclosure processing timelines are expected to continue to result in elevated levels of nonaccrual loans in the residential real estate portfolios.At December&#160;31, 2012, the Firm reported, in accordance with regulatory guidance, $1.7 billion of residential real estate and auto loans that were discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (&#8220;Chapter 7 loans&#8221;) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. Pursuant to that guidance, these Chapter 7 loans were charged off to the net realizable value of the collateral, resulting in $800 million of charge-offs for the year ended December&#160;31, 2012. The Firm expects to recover a significant amount of these losses over time as principal payments are received. The Firm also began reporting performing junior liens that are subordinate to senior liens that are 90 days or more past due as nonaccrual loans in the first quarter of 2012, based upon regulatory guidance. Nonaccrual loans included $3.0 billion of loans at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;based upon the regulatory guidance noted above. The prior year was not restated for the policy changes.Real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;):&#32;REO assets are managed for prompt sale and disposition at the best possible economic value. REO assets are those individual properties where the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). The Firm generally recognizes REO assets at the completion of the foreclosure process or upon execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure with the borrower. REO assets, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, decreased by $33 million&#32;from $647 million&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, to $614 million&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013.At December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by the U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $2.1 billion&#32;and $3.4 billion, respectively; not included in REO, that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure. The Firm also had PCI residential real estate loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, with an unpaid principal balance of $4.8 billion&#32;and $8.2 billion, respectively.Credit CardTotal credit card loans were $127.8 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, a decrease of $202 million&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 1.67%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, from 2.10%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. For the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the net charge-off rates were 3.14%&#32;and 3.95%&#32;respectively. Charge-offs have improved compared with a year ago as a result of continued improvement in delinquent loans. The credit card portfolio continues to reflect a well-seasoned, &nbsp;largely rewards-based portfolio that has good U.S. geographic diversification. The greatest geographic concentration of credit card retained loans is in California, which represented 13%&#32;of total retained loans at both December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012.&#160;Loan outstanding concentration for the top five states of California, New York, Texas, Illinois and Florida consisted of $52.7 billion&#32;in receivables, or 41%&#32;of the retained loan portfolio, at December&#160;31, 2013, compared with $52.3 billion, or 41%, at December&#160;31, 2012.Geographic composition of Credit Card loans Modifications of credit card loansAt December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm had $3.1 billion&#32;and $4.8 billion, respectively, of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs. These balances included both credit card loans with modified payment terms and credit card loans that reverted back to their pre-modification payment terms because the cardholder did not comply with the modified payment terms. The decrease in modified credit card loans outstanding from December&#160;31, 2012, was attributable to a reduction in new modifications as well as ongoing payments and charge-offs on previously modified credit card loans. &nbsp;Consistent with the Firm's policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged-off. However, the Firm establishes an allowance, which is offset against loans and charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income.For additional information about loan modification programs to borrowers, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisThe wholesale credit environment remained favorable throughout 2013&#32;driving an increase in commercial client activity. Discipline in underwriting across all areas of lending continues to remain a key point of focus, consistent with evolving market conditions and the Firm's risk management activities. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of credit quality and of industry, product and client concentrations. During the year, wholesale&#32;criticized assets and nonperforming assets decreased from higher levels experienced in 2012, including a reduction in nonaccrual loans by 39%.As of December&#160;31, 2013, wholesale exposure (primarily CIB, CB and AM) increased by $13.7 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, primarily driven by increases of $11.4 billion&#32;in lending-related commitments and $8.4 billion&#32;in loans reflecting increased client activity primarily in CB and AM. These increases were partially offset by a $9.2 billion&#32;decrease in derivative receivables. Derivative receivables decreased predominantly due to reductions in interest rate derivatives driven by an increase in interest rates and reductions in commodity derivatives due to market movements. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in equity derivatives driven by a rise in equity markets.&nbsp;The following table presents summaries of the maturity and ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012. The ratings scale is based on the Firm's internal risk ratings, which generally correspond to the ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's.Wholesale credit exposure &#8211; selected industry exposuresThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, paying particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators' definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, decreased by 22%&#32;to $12.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, from $15.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, primarily due to repayments and sales.Management's discussion and analysisBelow are summaries of the top 25 industry exposures as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012. For additional information on industry concentrations, see Note 5 on page 219&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisPresented below is a discussion of several industries to which the Firm has significant exposure and continues to monitor because of actual or potential credit concerns. For additional information, refer to the tables on the previous pages.LoansIn the normal course of its wholesale business, the Firm provides loans to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. For further discussion on loans, including information on credit quality indicators, see Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.The Firm actively manages its wholesale credit exposure. One way of managing credit risk is through secondary market sales of loans and lending-related commitments. During 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm sold $16.3 billion&#32;and $8.4 billion, respectively, of loans and lending-related commitments.&nbsp;The following table presents the change in the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012. Nonaccrual wholesale loans decreased by $673 million&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, largely reflecting paydowns.(a) During 2013, certain loans that resulted from restructurings that were previously classified as performing were reclassified as nonperforming loans. Prior periods were revised to conform with the current presentation.The following table presents net charge-offs/recoveries, which are defined as gross charge-offs less recoveries, for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012. The amounts in the table below do not include gains or losses from sales of nonaccrual loans.Receivables from customersReceivables from customers primarily represent margin loans to prime and retail brokerage clients that are collateralized through a pledge of assets maintained in clients' brokerage accounts that are subject to daily minimum collateral requirements. In the event that the collateral value decreases, a maintenance margin call is made to the client to provide additional collateral into the account. If additional collateral is not provided by the client, the client's position may be liquidated by the Firm to meet the minimum collateral requirements.Lending-related commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparties draw down on these commitments or the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the counterparties subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of these contracts.In the Firm's view, the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the Firm's actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. In determining the amount of credit risk exposure the Firm has to wholesale lending-related commitments, which is used as the basis for allocating credit risk capital to these commitments, the Firm has established a &#8220;loan-equivalent&#8221; amount for each commitment; this amount represents the portion of the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is expected, based on average portfolio historical experience, to become drawn upon in an event of a default by an obligor. The loan-equivalent amount of the Firm's lending-related commitments was $218.9 billion&#32;and $223.7 billion&#32;as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively.Clearing servicesThe Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into securities and derivative transactions. Through the provision of these services the Firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by central counterparties (&#8220;CCPs&#8221;). Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. For further discussion of Clearing services, see Note 29 on 318&#8211;324, of this Annual Report.&nbsp;Derivative contractsIn the normal course of business, the Firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities. Derivatives enable customers to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and other markets. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange traded derivatives (&#8220;ETD&#8221;) such as futures and options, and &#8220;cleared&#8221; over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC-cleared&#8221;) derivatives, the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising on derivatives transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. For further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types, see Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report.The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.Management's discussion and analysisDerivative receivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $65.8 billion&#32;and $75.0 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively.&#160;These amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts, after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating $14.4 billion&#32;and $15.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor.In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily: cash; G7 government securities; other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities; and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Though this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative transactions move in the Firm's favor. As of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm held $29.0 billion, of this additional collateral. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements, see Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report.While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (&#8220;DRE&#8221;), and Average exposure (&#8220;AVG&#8221;). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.Peak exposure to a counterparty is an extreme measure of exposure calculated at a 97.5%&#32;confidence level. DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. The measurement is done by equating the unexpected loss in a derivative counterparty exposure (which takes into consideration both the loss volatility and the credit rating of the counterparty) with the unexpected loss in a loan exposure (which takes into consideration only the credit rating of the counterparty). DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is the primary measure used by the Firm for credit approval of derivative transactions.&nbsp;Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm's derivative receivables at future time periods, including the benefit of collateral. AVG exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the CVA, as further described below. The three year AVG exposure was $35.4 billion&#32;and $42.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively, compared with derivative receivables, net of all collateral, of $51.3 billion&#32;and $59.8 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively.The fair value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment, the CVA, to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. The CVA is based on the Firm's AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty's credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The primary components of changes in CVA are credit spreads, new deal activity or unwinds, and changes in the underlying market environment. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm's risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the Firm's exposure to a counterparty (AVG) and the counterparty's credit quality. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with that counterparty's AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative transactions, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative transactions.The accompanying graph shows exposure profiles to derivatives over the next 10&#160;years as calculated by the DRE and AVG metrics. The two measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.The following table summarizes the ratings profile by derivative counterparty of the Firm's derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of other liquid securities collateral, for the dates indicated.As noted above, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm's derivatives transactions subject to collateral agreements &#8211; excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity &#8211; was 86%&#32;as of December&#160;31, 2013, largely unchanged compared with December&#160;31, 2012.Credit derivativesThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker; and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm's own credit risk associated with various exposures.For a detailed description of credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report.Credit portfolio management activitiesIncluded in end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm's wholesale businesses (collectively, &#8220;credit portfolio management&#8221; activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. For further information on derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, see Credit derivatives in Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain AFS securities and from certain securities held in the Firm's market-making businesses. These credit derivatives, as well as the synthetic credit portfolio, are not included in credit portfolio management activities; for further information on these credit derivatives as well as credit derivatives used in the Firm's capacity as a market maker in credit derivatives, see Credit derivatives in Note 6 on pages 231&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisThe credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm's view, of the true changes in value of the Firm's overall credit exposure.The effectiveness of the Firm's credit default swap (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) protection as a hedge of the Firm's exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS), and the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm) and the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm's exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm.&nbsp;Credit portfolio hedgesThe following table sets out the fair value related to the Firm's credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, the fair value related to the CVA (which reflects the credit quality of derivatives counterparty exposure), as well as certain other hedges used in the risk management of CVA. These results can vary from period-to-period due to market conditions that affect specific positions in the portfolio.The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. The Firm is a national leader in community development by providing loans, investments and community development services in communities across the United States.At December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, the Firm's CRA loan portfolio was approximately $18 billion&#32;and $16 billion, respectively. At December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, 50%&#32;and &nbsp;62%, respectively, of the CRA portfolio were residential mortgage loans; 26%&#32;and 13%, respectively, were commercial real estate loans; 16%&#32;and 18%, respectively, were business banking loans; and 8%&#32;and 7%, respectively, were other loans. CRA nonaccrual loans were 3%&#32;and 4%, respectively, of the Firm's total nonaccrual loans. For the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were 1%&#32;and 3%, respectively, of the Firm's net charge-offs in both years.JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses covers the consumer (primarily scored) portfolio; and wholesale (risk-rated) portfolio. The allowance represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm's loan portfolio. Management also determines an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments.The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component, a formula-based component, and a component related to PCI loans. For a further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 174&#8211;178&#32;and Note 15 on pages 284&#8211;287&#32;of this Annual Report.At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Controller of the Firm, and discussed with the Risk Policy and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of the Firm. As of December&#160;31, 2013, JPMorgan Chase&#32;deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.The allowance for credit losses was $17.0 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, a decrease of $5.6 billion&#32;from $22.6&#160;billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses was due to a $5.5 billion&#32;reduction in the consumer portfolio allowance reflecting lower estimated losses due to the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio and improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios. However, relatively high unemployment, uncertainties regarding the ultimate success of loan modifications, and the risk attributes of certain loans within the portfolio (e.g., loans with high LTV ratios, junior lien loans that are subordinate to a delinquent or modified senior lien, HELOCs with future payment recast) continued to contribute to uncertainty regarding the performance of the residential real estate portfolio; these uncertainties were considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses.&nbsp;The consumer, excluding credit card, allowance for loan losses decreased $3.8 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012, of which $2.3 billion was from the real estate portfolio non credit-impaired allowance and $1.6 billion from the PCI allowance. The decrease in the allowance was largely due to the impact of improved home prices as well as improved delinquency trends. For additional information about delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;and Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.The credit card allowance for loan losses decreased by $1.7&#160;billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2012. The decrease included reductions in both the asset-specific and formula-based allowance. The reduction in the asset-specific allowance, which relates to loans restructured in TDRs, largely reflects the changing profile of the TDR portfolio. The volume of new TDRs, which have higher loss rates due to expected redefaults, continues to decrease, and the loss rate on existing TDRs is also decreasing over time as previously restructured loans continue to perform. The reduction in the formula-based allowance was primarily driven by the continuing trend of improving delinquencies and a reduction in bankruptcies. For additional information about delinquencies in the credit card loan portfolio, see Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 120&#8211;129&#32;and Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report.The wholesale allowance was relatively unchanged reflecting a favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends.The allowance for lending-related commitments for both the consumer, excluding credit card, and wholesale portfolios, which is reported in other liabilities, was $705 million&#32;and $668 million&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013, and December&#160;31, 2012, respectively.Management's discussion and analysisProvision for credit lossesFor the year ended December&#160;31, 2013, the provision for credit losses was $225 million, down by 93%&#32;from 2012. The provision for the year ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;included a $5.6 billion&#32;reduction in the allowance for loan losses, due to the impact of improved home prices on the residential real estate portfolio and improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios.Total consumer provision for credit losses was $308 million&#32;in 2013, compared with $3.7 billion&#32;in 2012. The decline in the total consumer provision was attributable to continued reductions in the allowance for loan losses, resulting from the impact of improved home prices on the residential real &nbsp;estate portfolio, and improved delinquency trends in the residential real estate and credit card portfolios, as well as lower net charge-offs, partially due to the prior year incremental charge-offs of $800 million&#32;recorded in accordance with regulatory guidance on certain loans discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.In 2013&#32;the wholesale provision for credit losses was a benefit of $83 million, compared with a benefit of $361 million&#32;in 2012. The current periods' wholesale provision for credit losses reflected a favorable credit environment and stable credit quality trends. For further information on the provision for credit losses, see the Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 71&#8211;74&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisMarket risk is the potential for adverse changes in the value of the Firm's assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, implied volatilities or credit spreads.Market risk managementMarket Risk is an independent risk management function that works in close partnership with the lines of business, including Treasury and CIO within Corporate/Private Equity, to identify and monitor market risks throughout the Firm and to define market risk policies and procedures. The Market Risk function reports to the Firm's CRO.Market Risk seeks to control risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm's market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk is responsible for the following functions:&nbsp;Risk identification and classificationEach line of business is responsible for the management of the market risks within its units. The independent risk management group responsible for overseeing each line of business is charged with ensuring that all material market risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk policy framework set out by Market Risk. Risk measurementTools used to measure riskBecause no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, the Firm uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, including:The following table summarizes by LOB the predominant business activities that give rise to market risks, and the market risk management tools utilized to manage those risks; CB is not presented in the table below as it does not give rise to significant market risk.Management's discussion and analysisValue-at-riskJPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR, a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in a normal market environment consistent with the day-to-day risk decisions made by the lines of business.The Firm has one overarching VaR model framework, Risk Management VaR, used for risk management purposes across the Firm, which utilizes historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework's approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a stable measure of VaR that closely aligns to the day-to-day risk management decisions made by the lines of business and provides necessary/appropriate information to respond to risk events on a daily basis.Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. This means that, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR &#8220;band breaks,&#8221; defined as losses greater than that predicted by VaR estimates, not more than five times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR band breaks observed can differ from the statistically expected number of band breaks if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the twelve months of historical data used in the VaR calculation. Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual products and/or risk factors. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm's risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.Data sources used in VaR models may be the same as those used for financial statement valuations. However, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the sources may differ. In addition, the daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in their monthly valuation process (see pages 196&#8211;200&#32;of this Annual Report for further information on the Firm's valuation process.) VaR model calculations require more timely (i.e., daily) data and a consistent source for valuation and therefore it is not &nbsp;practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process.VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks across businesses and monitoring limits. These VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.Since VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential losses, and it is not used to estimate the impact of stressed market conditions or to manage any impact from potential stress events. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions. As VaR cannot be used to determine future losses in the Firm's market risk positions, the Firm considers other metrics, such as economic-value stress testing and other techniques, as described further below, to capture and manage its market risk positions under stressed scenarios.For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm uses alternative methods to capture and measure those risk parameters that are not otherwise captured in VaR, including economic-value stress testing, nonstatistical measures and risk identification for large exposures as described further below.The Firm's VaR model calculations are continuously evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's modeling techniques and other factors. Such changes will also affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Model changes go through a review and approval process by the Model Review Group prior to implementation into the operating environment. For further information, see Model risk on page 153&#32;of this Annual Report.Separately, the Firm calculates a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (&#8220;Regulatory VaR&#8221;), which is used to derive the Firm's regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under the Basel 2.5 Market Risk Rule (&#8220;Basel 2.5&#8221;). This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to &#8220;covered&#8221; positions as defined by Basel 2.5, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans&#32;are included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. For additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital (e.g. VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting) for the Firm, see JPMorgan Chase's &nbsp;&#8220;Regulatory Capital Disclosures &#8211; Market Risk Pillar 3 Report&#8221; which are available on the Firm's website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm) and Capital Management on pages 160&#8211;167&#32;of this Annual Report. The table below shows the results of the Firm's Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.As presented in the table above, average Total VaR and average CIB VaR decreased during 2013 compared with 2012. These decreases were primarily driven by reduced risk in the synthetic credit portfolio and lower market volatility across multiple asset classes.During the third quarter of 2012, the Firm applied a new VaR model to calculate VaR for CIO's synthetic credit portfolio that had been transferred to the CIB on July 2, 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, in order to achieve consistency among like products within CIB and in conjunction with the implementation of Basel 2.5 requirements, the Firm moved CIO's synthetic credit portfolio to an existing VaR model within the CIB. This change had an insignificant impact to the average fixed income VaR and average total CIB trading and credit portfolio VaR, and it had no impact to the average Total VaR compared with the model used in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. &nbsp;Average Treasury and CIO VaR for the year ended December 31, 2013, decreased from 2012, predominantly reflecting the reduction in and transfer of risk from CIO's synthetic credit portfolio to the CIB on July 2, 2012. The index credit derivative positions retained by CIO were effectively closed out during the three months ended September 30, 2012.Average Mortgage Banking VaR for the year ended December 31, 2013, decreased from 2012. The decrease is attributable to reduced risk across the Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing businesses. The Firm's average Total VaR diversification benefit was $9 million or 15% of the sum for 2013, compared with $45 million or 23% of the sum for 2012. In general, over the course of the year, VaR exposure can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates and diversification benefits change.Management's discussion and analysisVaR back-testing The Firm evaluates the effectiveness of its VaR methodology by back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses recognized on market-risk related revenue. Effective during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Firm revised its definition of market risk-related gains and losses to be consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel 2.5. Under this definition market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: profits and losses on the Firm's Risk Management positions, excluding&#32;fees, commissions, fair value adjustments, net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading. &nbsp;The following chart compares the daily market risk-related gains and losses on the Firm's Risk Management positions for the year ended December 31, 2013, under the revised definition. As the chart presents market risk-related gains and losses related to those positions included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR, the results in the table below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Firm's Basel 2.5 report, which are based on Regulatory VaR. The chart shows that for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Firm observed two VaR band breaks and posted gains on 177 of the 260 days in this period.Prior to the fourth quarter of 2013, the Firm disclosed a histogram which presented the results of daily backtesting against its daily market risk-related gains and losses for positions included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR calculation. Under this previous presentation, the market risk related revenue was defined as the change in value of: principal transactions revenue for CIB, and Treasury and CIO; trading-related net interest income for CIB, Treasury and CIO, and Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing in CCB; CIB brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or &nbsp;other revenue; revenue from syndicated lending facilities that the Firm intends to distribute; mortgage fees and related income for the Firm's mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans, MSRs, and all related hedges; and market-risk related revenue from Asset Management hedges; gains and losses from DVA were excluded. Under this prior measure there were no VaR band breaks nor any trading loss days for the year ended December 31, 2013.Other risk measuresEconomic-value stress testingAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool in measuring and controlling risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior as an indicator of losses, stress testing is intended to capture the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets. The Firm runs weekly stress tests on market-related risks across the lines of business using multiple scenarios that assume significant changes in risk factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates or commodity prices. The framework uses a grid-based approach, which calculates multiple magnitudes of stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs for each risk factor. Stress-test results, trends and explanations based on current market risk positions are reported to the Firm's senior management and to the lines of business to allow them to better understand the sensitivity of positions to certain defined events and to enable them to manage their risks with more transparency.Stress scenarios are defined and reviewed by Market Risk, and significant changes are reviewed by the relevant Risk Committees. While most of the scenarios estimate losses based on significant market moves, such as an equity market collapse or credit crisis, the Firm also develops scenarios to quantify risk arising from specific portfolios or concentrations of risks, which attempt to capture certain idiosyncratic market movements. Scenarios may be redefined on an ongoing basis to reflect current market conditions. Ad hoc scenarios are run in response to specific market events or concerns. Furthermore, the Firm's stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results under scenarios mandated by the Federal Reserve's CCAR and ICAAP (&#8220;Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process&#8221;) processes.Nonstatistical risk measuresNonstatistical risk measures include sensitivities to variables used to value positions, such as credit spread sensitivities, interest rate basis point values and market values. These measures provide granular information on the Firm's market risk exposure. They are aggregated by line-of-business and by risk type, and are used for tactical control and monitoring limits.Loss advisories and profit and loss drawdownsLoss advisories and profit and loss drawdowns are tools used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. Profit and loss drawdowns are defined as the decline in net profit and loss since the year-to-date peak revenue level.&nbsp;Risk identification for large exposuresIndividuals who manage risk positions consider potential material losses that could arise from specific, unusual events, such as a potential change in tax legislation, or a particular combination of unusual market moves. This information allows the Firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability that is not adequately covered by standard risk measures.Earnings-at-riskThe VaR and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets to changes in market variables. The effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income is also important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt. The CIO, Treasury and Corporate (&#8220;CTC&#8221;) Risk Committee establishes the Firm's structural interest rate risk policies and market risk limits, which are subject to approval by the Risk Policy Committee of the Firm's Board of Directors. CIO, working in partnership with the lines of business, calculates the Firm's structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management including the CTC Risk Committee and the Firm's ALCO.Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors, including:The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, corporate-wide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury through a transfer-pricing system, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. All transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed.Oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight, Management's discussion and analysiscreating governance over assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk.The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and related derivatives. The Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk exposure through earnings-at-risk, which measures the extent to which changes in interest rates will affect the Firm's core net interest income (see page 83&#32;of this Annual Report for further discussion of core net interest income) and interest rate-sensitive fees. Earnings-at-risk excludes the impact of trading activities and MSR, as these sensitivities are captured under VaR.The Firm conducts simulations of changes in structural interest rate-sensitive revenue under a variety of interest rate scenarios. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change in this revenue, and the corresponding impact to the Firm's pretax core net interest income, over the following 12 months, utilizing multiple assumptions as described below. These scenarios highlight exposures to changes in interest rates, pricing sensitivities on deposits, optionality and changes in product mix. The scenarios include forecasted balance sheet changes, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on current interest rates compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. The change in earnings-at-risk from December&#160;31, 2012, resulted from higher expected deposit balances, partially offset by repositioning the investment securities portfolio. The Firm's benefit to rising rates is largely a result of reinvesting at higher yields and assets re-pricing at a faster pace than deposits.Additionally, another interest rate scenario used by the Firm &#8212; involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels &#8212; results in a 12-month pretax core net interest income benefit of $407 million. The increase in core net interest income under this scenario reflects the Firm reinvesting at the higher long-term rates, with funding costs remaining unchanged.&nbsp;Risk monitoring and controlLimitsMarket risk is controlled primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, the Firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity and accommodation of client business and management experience. The Firm maintains different levels of limits. Corporate level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, line of business limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by loss advisories, nonstatistical measurements and profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be allocated within the lines of business, as well at the portfolio level.Limits are established by Market Risk in agreement with the lines of business. Limits are reviewed regularly by Market Risk and updated as appropriate, with any changes approved by lines of business management and Market Risk. Senior management, including the Firm's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Risk Officer, are responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. All limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk are escalated to senior management. The lines of business are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner by Risk Management to limit approvers, Market Risk and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk consults with Firm senior management and lines of business senior management to determine the appropriate course of action required to return to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the excess. Any Firm or line of business-level limits that are in excess for three business days or longer, or that are over limit by more than 30%, are escalated to senior management and the Firmwide Risk Committee.Country risk is the risk that a sovereign event or action alters the value or terms of contractual obligations of obligors, counterparties and issuers, or adversely impacts markets related to a country. The Firm has a comprehensive country risk management framework for assessing country risks, determining risk tolerance, and measuring and monitoring direct country exposures in the Firm. The Country Risk Management group is responsible for developing guidelines and policy for managing country risk in both emerging and developed countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios giving rise to country risk to ensure the Firm's country risk exposures are diversified and that exposure levels are appropriate given the Firm's strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.Country risk organizationThe Country Risk Management group is an independent risk management function which works in close partnership with other risk functions to identify and monitor country risk within the Firm. The Firmwide Risk Executive for Country Risk reports to the Firm's CRO.Country Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:Country risk identification and measurementThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm's internal country risk management approach, country exposure is reported based on the country where the majority of the assets of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor are located or where the majority of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (legal residence) or country of incorporation of the obligor, counterparty, issuer or guarantor. Country exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm's risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain tranched credit derivatives. Different measurement approaches or assumptions would affect the amount of reported country exposure.&nbsp;Under the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework: The Firm also has indirect exposures to country risk (for example, related to the collateral received on securities financing receivables or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through the Firm's credit, market, and operational risk governance, rather than through Country Risk Management.The Firm's internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under FFIEC bank regulatory requirements as there are significant differences in reporting methodology. For further information on the FFIEC's reporting methodology, see Cross-border outstandings on page 357&#32;of the 2013&#32;Form 10-K.Management's discussion and analysisCountry risk stress testingThe country risk stress framework aims to identify potential losses arising from a country crisis by capturing the impact of large asset price movements in a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically defines and runs ad hoc stress scenarios for individual countries in response to specific market events and sector performance concerns. Country risk monitoring and controlThe Country Risk Management Group establishes guidelines for sovereign ratings reviews and limit management. Country stress and nominal exposures are measured under a comprehensive country limit framework. Country ratings and limits activity are actively monitored and reported on a regular basis. Country limit requirements are reviewed and approved by senior management as often as necessary, but at least annually. In addition, the Country Risk Management group uses surveillance tools for early identification of potential country risk concerns, such as signaling models and ratings indicators. &nbsp;Country risk reportingThe following table presents the Firm's top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.). The selection of countries is based solely on the Firm's largest total exposures by country, based on the Firm's internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm's view of any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions.Selected European exposureNotwithstanding the economic and fiscal situation in Europe showing signs of stabilization, with Spain and Ireland exiting their bail out programs and some encouraging progress on financial reform, the Firm continues to closely monitor its exposures in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Greece. Management believes its exposure to these five countries is modest relative to the Firm's aggregate exposures. The Firm continues to conduct business and support client activity in these countries and, therefore, the Firm's aggregate net exposures and sector distribution may vary over time. In addition, the net exposures may be affected by changes in market conditions, including the effects of interest rates and credit spreads on market valuations.The following table presents the Firm's direct exposure to Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Greece at December&#160;31, 2013, as measured under the Firm's internal country risk management approach. For individual exposures, corporate clients represent approximately 93%&#32;of the Firm's non-sovereign exposure in these five countries, and substantially all of the remaining 7%&#32;of the non-sovereign exposure is to the banking sector.Management's discussion and analysisEffect of credit derivatives on selected European exposuresCountry exposures in the Selected European exposure table above have been reduced by purchasing protection through single name, index, and tranched credit derivatives. The following table presents the effect of purchased and sold credit derivatives on the trading and portfolio hedging activities in the Selected European exposure table.Under the Firm's internal country risk management approach, credit derivatives are generally reported based on the country where the majority of the assets of the reference entity are located. Exposures are measured assuming that all of the reference entities in a particular country default simultaneously with zero recovery. For example, single-name and index credit derivatives are measured at the notional amount, net of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable. Exposures for index credit derivatives, which may include several underlying reference entities, are determined by evaluating the relevant country for each of the reference entities underlying the named index, and allocating the applicable amount of the notional and fair value of the index credit derivative to each of the relevant countries. Tranched credit derivatives are measured at the modeled change in value of the derivative assuming the simultaneous default of all underlying reference entities in a specific country; this approach considers the tranched nature of the derivative (i.e., that some tranches are subordinate to others) and the Firm's own position in the structure.The &#8220;Total&#8221; line in the table above represents the simple sum of the individual countries. Changes in the Firm's methodology or assumptions would produce different results.The credit derivatives reflected in the &#8220;Portfolio hedging&#8221; column are predominantly single-name CDS used in the Firm's credit portfolio management activities, which are intended to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities and derivative counterparty &nbsp;exposure. The effectiveness of the Firm's CDS protection as a hedge of the Firm's exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection, the named reference entity, and the contractual terms of the CDS. For further information about credit derivatives see Credit derivatives on pages 137&#8211;138, and Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233&#32;of this Annual Report.The Firm's net presentation of purchased and sold credit derivatives reflects the manner in which this exposure is managed, and reflects, in the Firm's view, the substantial mitigation of market and counterparty credit risk in its credit derivative activities. Market risk is substantially mitigated because market-making activities, and to a lesser extent, hedging activities, often result in selling and purchasing protection related to the same underlying reference entity. For example, for each of the five named countries as of December&#160;31, 2013, the protection sold by the Firm was more than 94%&#32;offset by protection purchased on the identical reference entity.In addition, counterparty credit risk has also been substantially mitigated by the master netting and collateral agreements in place for these credit derivatives. As of December&#160;31, 2013, 100%&#32;of the purchased protection presented in the table above is purchased under contracts that require posting of cash collateral; 88%&#32;is purchased from investment-grade counterparties domiciled outside of the selected European countries; and 68%&#32;of the protection purchased offsets protection sold on the identical reference entity, with the identical counterparty subject to a master netting agreement.Model riskThe Firm uses models, for many purposes, but primarily for the measurement, monitoring and management of risk positions. Valuation models are employed by the Firm to value certain financial instruments which cannot otherwise be valued using quoted prices. These valuation models may also be employed as inputs to risk management models, including VaR and economic stress models. The Firm also makes use of models for a number of other purposes, including the calculation of regulatory capital requirements and estimating the allowance for credit losses.Models are owned by various functions within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. For example, VaR models and certain regulatory capital models are owned by the line-of-business aligned risk management functions. Owners of models are responsible for the development, implementation and testing of their models, as well as referral of models to the Model Risk function (within the Model Risk and Development unit) for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of a robust operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model owners may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and for changes in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities. The Model Risk function is part of the Firm's Model Risk and Development unit, which in turn reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Model Risk function is independent of the model owners and reviews and approves a wide range of models, including risk management, valuation and certain regulatory capital models used by the Firm.Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm's reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of the Model Risk function. A model review conducted by the Model Risk function considers the model's &nbsp;suitability for the specific uses to which it will be put. The factors considered in reviewing a model include whether the model accurately reflects the characteristics of the product and its significant risks, the selection and reliability of model inputs, consistency with models for similar products, the appropriateness of any model-related adjustments, and sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions that cannot be observed from the market. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within the Model Risk function based on the relevant tier of the model.Under the Firm's model risk policy, new models, as well as material changes to existing models, are reviewed and approved by the Model Risk function prior to implementation in the operating environment. In the event that the Model Risk function does not approve a model, the model owner is required to remediate the model within a time period agreed upon with the Model Risk function. The model owner is also required to resubmit the model for review to the Model Risk function and to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity. The Firm may also implement other appropriate risk measurement tools to augment the model that is subject to remediation.Exceptions to the Firm's model risk policy may be granted by the head of the Model Risk function to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. For a summary of valuations based on models, see Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 176&#8211;177&#32;and Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisPrincipal investments are predominantly privately-held financial assets and instruments, typically representing an ownership or junior capital position, that have unique risks due to their illiquidity or for which there is less observable market or valuation data. Such investing activities, including private equity investments, mezzanine financing, and tax-oriented investments are typically intended to be held over extended investment periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term gain with respect to these investments. The Firm's approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm's general risk governance structure. A firm-wide risk policy framework exists for all principal investing activities. All investments are approved by investment committees that include executives who are independent from the investing businesses. An independent valuation function is responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying values of principal investments, in accordance with relevant accounting, valuation and risk policies. Targeted levels for total and annual investments are established in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. Industry, geographic, and position level &nbsp;concentration limits are in place and intended to ensure diversification of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.&#32;The Firm's principal investments are managed under various lines of business and are captured within the respective LOB's financial results. Principal investments cover multiple asset classes and occur either as a standalone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform. Asset classes include private equity, tax equity investments including affordable housing, and mezzanine/junior debt investments. The majority of the Firm's private equity is reported separately under Corporate/Private Equity (for detailed information, see Private Equity portfolio on page 111 of this Annual Report).Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or external events.OverviewOperational risk is inherent in each of the Firm's businesses and support activities. Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways, including errors, fraudulent acts, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, or vendors that do not perform in accordance with their arrangements. These events could result in financial losses, including litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damage to the Firm, including reputational harm. To monitor and control operational risk, the Firm maintains an overall framework that includes oversight and governance, policies and procedures, consistent practices across the lines of business, and enterprise risk management tools intended to provide a sound and well-controlled operational environment.The framework clarifies:The goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, in light of the Firm's financial strength, the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates, and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.In order to strengthen the focus on the Firm's control environment and drive consistent practices across businesses and functional areas, the Firm established a Firmwide Oversight and Control Group during 2012. Oversight and Control is comprised of dedicated control officers within each of the lines of business and Corporate functional areas, as well as a central oversight team. The group is charged with enhancing the Firm's controls by looking within and across the lines of business and Corporate functional areas to identify and control issues. The group enables the Firm to detect control problems more quickly, escalate issues promptly and get the right people involved to understand common themes and interdependencies among the various parts of the Firm. The group works closely with the Firm's other control-related functions, including Compliance, Legal, Internal Audit and Risk Management, to effectively remediate identified control issues across all affected areas of the Firm. As a result, the group facilitates the effective execution of the &nbsp;Firm's control framework and helps support operational risk management across the Firm. Risk Management is responsible for defining the Operational Risk Management Framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across the Firm.Operational risk management frameworkThe Firm's approach to operational risk management is intended to identify potential issues and mitigate losses by supplementing traditional control-based approaches to operational risk with risk measures, tools and disciplines that are risk-specific, consistently applied and utilized firmwide. Key themes are transparency of information, escalation of key issues and accountability for issue resolution.In addition to the standard Basel risk event categories, the Firm has developed the operational risk categorization taxonomy below for purposes of identification, monitoring, reporting and analysis:Key components of the Operational Risk Management Framework include:Risk governance The Firmwide Control Committee (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) provides a forum for senior management to review and discuss firmwide operational risks including existing and emerging issues as well as operational risk metrics, management and execution. The FCC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised from LOB and Functional Control Committees, particularly those with potential enterprise-wide impact. The FCC (as well as the LOB and Functional Control Committees) oversees the risk and control environment, which includes reviewing the identification, management and monitoring of operational risk, control&#32;issues, remediation actions and enterprise-wide trends. The FCC escalates significant issues to the FRC.Management's discussion and analysisRisk identification assessmentIn order to evaluate and monitor operational risk, businesses and functions utilize the Firm's standard risk and control self-assessment (&#8220;RCSA&#8221;) process and supporting architecture. The RCSA process requires management to identify material inherent operational risks, assess the design and operating effectiveness of relevant controls designed to mitigate such risks, and evaluate residual risk. Action plans are developed for control issues that are identified, and businesses are held accountable for tracking and resolving issues on a timely basis.Risk monitoringThe Firm has a process for monitoring operational risk event data, which permits analysis of errors and losses as well as trends. Such analysis, performed both at a line of business level and by risk-event type, enables identification of the causes associated with risk events faced by the businesses. Where available, the internal data can be supplemented with external data for comparative analysis with industry patterns.Risk reporting and analysisOperational risk management reports provide information, including actual operational loss levels, self-assessment results and the status of issue resolution to the lines of business and senior management. The purpose of these reports is to enable management to maintain operational risk at appropriate levels within each line of business, to escalate issues and to provide consistent data aggregation across the Firm's businesses and functions.Risk measurementOperational risk is measured using a statistical model based on the loss distribution approach. The operational risk capital model uses actual losses, a comprehensive inventory of forward looking potential loss scenarios and adjustments to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment in determining firmwide operational risk capital. This methodology is designed to comply with the Advanced Measurement rules under the Basel framework. For additional information on operational risk capital, see Regulatory Capital on pages 161&#8211;165&#32;of this Annual Report.Operational risk management systemThe Firm's operational risk framework is supported by Phoenix, an internally designed operational risk system, which integrates the individual components of the operational risk management framework into a unified, web-based tool. Phoenix enhances the capture, reporting and analysis of operational risk data by enabling risk identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and analysis to be done in an integrated manner across the Firm.&nbsp;Audit alignmentInternal Audit utilizes a risk-based program of audit coverage to provide an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of key controls over the Firm's operations, regulatory compliance and reporting. This includes reviewing the operational risk framework, the effectiveness of the business self-assessment process, and the loss data-collection and reporting activities.InsuranceOne of the ways operational loss is mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance to be in compliance with local laws and regulations (e.g., workers compensation), as well as to serve other needs (e.g., property loss and public liability). Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business. The insurance purchased is reviewed and approved by senior management.CybersecurityThe Firm devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm's computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Firm and several other U.S. financial institutions continue to experience significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which are intended to disrupt online banking services. The Firm is also regularly targeted by third-parties using malicious code and viruses, and has also experienced other attempts to breach the security of the Firm's systems and data which, in certain instances, have resulted in unauthorized access to customer account data. The Firm has established, and continues to establish, defenses on an ongoing basis to mitigate these attacks, and these cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of the Firm's operations, material harm to the Firm's customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on the Firm's results of operations.Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm's business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) could also be sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks which could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients.The Firm is working with appropriate government agencies and other businesses, including the Firm's third-party service providers, to continue to enhance defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats.Business resiliencyJPMorgan Chase's global resiliency and crisis management program is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption, and to remain in compliance with global laws and regulations as they relate to resiliency risk. The program includes corporate governance, awareness and training, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to ensure that risks are properly identified, assessed, and managed.The Firm's Global Resiliency team has established comprehensive and qualitative tracking and reporting of resiliency plans in order to proactively anticipate and manage various potential disruptive circumstances such as severe weather, technology and communications outages, flooding, mass transit shutdowns and terrorist threats, &nbsp;among others. The resiliency measures utilized by the Firm include backup infrastructure for data centers, a geographically distributed workforce, dedicated recovery facilities, ensuring technological capabilities to support remote work capacity for displaced staff and accommodation of employees at alternate locations. JPMorgan Chase continues to coordinate its global resiliency program across the Firm and mitigate business continuity risks by reviewing and testing recovery procedures. The strength and proficiency of the Firm's global resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm's business operations during and quickly after various events that have resulted in business interruptions, such as Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Isaac in the U.S., monsoon rains in the Philippines, tsunamis in Asia, and earthquakes in Latin America.Management's discussion and analysisThe Firm's success depends not only on its prudent management of the liquidity, capital, credit, market, principal and operational risks that are part of its business risks, but equally on the recognition among its many constituents &#8212; customers and clients, employees, investors, government officials, regulators, as well as the&#160;general public &#8212; that the Firm adheres consistently to a set of core values that drive the way the Firm conducts business. The Firm has established policies and procedures, and has in place various oversight functions intended to promote its core values and the Firm's culture of &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221; by doing &#8220;first class business in a first class way&#8221;.The Firm has in place a Code of Conduct (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), and each employee is given annual training in respect of the Code and is required annually to affirm his or her compliance with the Code. The Code sets forth the Firm's core principles and fundamental values, including that no employee should ever sacrifice integrity &#8211; or give the impression that he or she has &#8211; even if one thinks it would help the Firm's business. The Code requires prompt reporting of any known or suspected violation of the Code, any internal Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm's business. It also requires the reporting of any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm's customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. Specified employees are specially trained and designated as &#8220;code specialists&#8221; who act as a resource to employees on Code of Conduct matters. In addition, concerns may be reported anonymously and the Firm prohibits retaliation against employees for the good faith reporting of any actual or suspected violations of the Code. Management of conflicts of interest is essential to the maintenance of the Firm's client relationships, and its reputation. Each of the various committees of senior management that oversee and approve transactions and activities undertaken by the Firm are responsible for considering any potential conflicts that may arise from such transactions or activities. In addition,&#160;the Firm's&#160;Conflicts Office examines the Firm's wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm. &nbsp;The risk of legal or regulatory fines or sanctions or of financial damage or loss due to the failure to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, is a primary focus of the Legal, Compliance and Oversight and Controls functions. In recent years, the Firm has experienced heightened scrutiny by its regulators of its compliance with regulations, and with respect to its controls and operational processes. The Firm expects such regulatory scrutiny will continue, and that regulators will increasingly use formal actions (such as Consent Orders) instead of informal supervisory actions (such as &#8220;Matters Requiring Attention&#8221;), resulting in findings of violations of law and impositions of fines and penalties.In addition to providing legal services and advice to the Firm, and communicating and helping businesses adjust to the legal and regulatory changes facing the businesses, including the heightened scrutiny and expectations of its regulators, the global Legal function is responsible for partnering with the businesses to fully understand and assess the businesses' adherence to laws and regulations, as well as potential exposures on key litigation and transactional matters. Global Compliance Risk Management is responsible for identifying and advising on compliance risks, establishing policies and procedures intended to mitigate and control compliance risks, implementing training and communication forums to provide appropriate oversight and coordination of compliance risks, overseeing remediation of compliance risks and issues, and independently monitoring and testing the Firm's compliance risk controls. Legal and Compliance, together with the Oversight and Control function, share responsibility with the businesses for identifying legal, compliance and regulatory issues, escalating these issues through the Firm's risk governance structures, and, as necessary, in assisting the businesses in their remediation efforts. For information about the Oversight & Control function, see Enterprise-Wide Risk Management on pages 113&#8211;173. Fiduciary risk is the risk of failing to exercise the applicable standard of loyalty and care, or to act in the best interests of clients or to treat all clients fairly as required under applicable law or regulation, potentially resulting in regulatory action, reputational harm or financial liability.Depending on the fiduciary activity and capacity in which the Firm is acting, federal and state statutes, common law and regulations require the Firm to adhere to specific duties in which the Firm must always place the client's interests above its own.Fiduciary risk governanceFiduciary Risk Management is the responsibility of the relevant LOB risk committees. Senior business, legal, risk and compliance management, who have particular responsibility for fiduciary issues, work with the relevant LOB risk committees with the goal of ensuring that businesses providing investment, trusts and estates, or other fiduciary products or services that give rise to fiduciary duties to clients, perform at the appropriate standard relative to their fiduciary relationship with a client. Each LOB and its respective risk and governance committees are responsible for the oversight and management of the fiduciary risks in their businesses. Of particular focus are the policies and practices that address a business' responsibilities to a client, including performance and service requirements and expectations; client suitability determinations; and disclosure obligations and communications. In this way, the relevant LOB risk committees provide oversight of the Firm's efforts to monitor, measure and control the performance and risks that may arise in the delivery of products or services to clients that give rise to such fiduciary duties, as well as those stemming from any of the Firm's fiduciary responsibilities under the Firm's various employee benefit plans.During 2013 the Firm created the Firmwide Fiduciary Risk Committee (&#8220;FFRC&#8221;). The FFRC provides a forum for discussing the risks inherent in the Firm's fiduciary activities. The Committee is responsible for a cross-LOB process to support the consistent identification, escalation and reporting of fiduciary risk issues firmwide. Issues from the FFRC may be escalated to the Firmwide Risk Committee. &nbsp;Maintenance of the Firm's reputation is the responsibility of each individual employee of the Firm.The Firm's Reputation Risk policy explicitly vests each employee with the responsibility to consider the reputation of the Firm, rather than business benefits and regulatory requirements alone, in deciding whether to pursue any new product, transaction, client, or any other activity. Since the types of events that could harm the Firm's reputation are so varied across the Firm's lines of business, each line of business has a separate reputation risk governance infrastructure in place, which comprises three key elements: clear, documented escalation criteria appropriate to the business footprint; a designated primary discussion forum &#8211; in most cases, one or more dedicated reputation risk committees; and a list of designated contacts. Line of business reputation risk governance is overseen by a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance function, which provides oversight of the governance infrastructure and process to support the consistent identification, escalation, management and reporting of reputation risk issues firmwide. Management's discussion and analysisA strong capital position is essential to the Firm's business strategy and competitive position. The Firm's capital strategy focuses on long-term stability, which enables the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment. Prior to making any decisions on future business activities, senior management considers the implications on the Firm's capital. In addition to considering the Firm's earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to preserving the Firm's capital strength. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative by the Firm's Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm's balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and reserves, and robust liquidity.The Firm's capital management objectives are to hold capital sufficient to:These objectives are achieved through ongoing monitoring of the Firm's capital position, regular stress testing, and a capital governance framework. Capital management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. JPMorgan Chase has firmwide and LOB processes for ongoing monitoring and active management of its capital position.Capital strategy and governanceThe Firm's CEO and Operating Committee establish principles and guidelines for capital planning, capital issuance, usage and distributions; and, establish capital targets and minimums for the level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and highly-stressed environments.&#160; The Firm's capital targets and minimums are calibrated to the U.S. Basel III requirements. The Firm's target Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III Advanced approach, on a fully phased-in basis, is 10%+.&#160;This long-term Tier 1 common ratio target level will enable the Firm to retain market access, continue the Firm's strategy to invest in and grow its businesses; and, maintain flexibility to distribute excess capital.&#160;The Firm intends to manage its capital so that it achieves the required capital levels and composition &nbsp;during the transition from Basel I to Basel III, in line with, or ahead of, the required timetable.The Firm's senior management recognizes the importance of a capital management function that supports strategic decision-making. The Firm has established the Capital Governance Committee and the Regulatory Capital Management Office (&#8220;RCMO&#8221;) as key components in support of this objective. The Capital Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the Firm's Capital Management Policy and the principles underlying capital issuance and distribution alternatives. The Committee is also responsible for governing the capital adequacy assessment process, including overall design, assumptions and risk streams, and ensuring that capital stress test programs are designed to adequately capture the idiosyncratic risks across the Firm's businesses. The RCMO is responsible for reviewing, approving and monitoring the implementation of the Firm's capital policies and strategies, as well as its capital adequacy assessment process. The Board of Director's Risk Policy Committee assesses the Firm's capital adequacy process and its components. This review encompasses determining the effectiveness of the capital adequacy process, the appropriateness of the risk tolerance levels, and the strength of the control infrastructure. For additional discussion on the Board's Risk Policy Committee, see Risk Management on pages 113&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report.Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment ProcessSemiannually, the Firm completes the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (&#8220;ICAAP&#8221;), which provides management with a view of the impact of severe and unexpected events on earnings, balance sheet positions, reserves and capital. The Firm's ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning.The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm's earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. However, when defining a broad range of scenarios, realized events can always be worse. Accordingly, management considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as necessary. ICAAP results are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors.Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;)The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve uses the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) stress test processes to ensure that large bank holding companies have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each bank holding company's unique risks to enable them to have the ability to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through the CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each bank holding company's capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes, as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases.The Firm's CCAR process is integrated into and employs the same methodologies utilized in the Firm's ICAAP process. On January 7, 2013, the Firm submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve's 2013 CCAR process. On March 14, 2013, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm's 2013 capital plan, but asked the Firm to submit an additional capital plan.On September 18, 2013, the Firm submitted the additional capital plan which addressed the weaknesses the Federal Reserve had identified in the Firm's original 2013 submission. On December 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm it did not object to the Firm's 2013 capital plan, as resubmitted.On January 6, 2014, the Firm submitted its 2014 capital plan to the Federal Reserve under the Federal Reserve's 2014 CCAR process. The Firm expects to receive the Federal Reserve's final response to its plan no later than March 14, 2014.For additional information on the Firm's capital actions, see Capital actions on pages 166&#8211;167, and Notes 22 and 23 on pages 309&#32;and 310, respectively, of this Annual Report.Capital DisciplinesThe Firm uses three primary capital disciplines:&nbsp;Regulatory capitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm's national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase&#160;Bank&#160;USA,&#160;N.A.In connection with the U.S. Government's Supervisory Capital Assessment Program in 2009 (&#8220;SCAP&#8221;), U.S. banking regulators developed an additional measure of capital, Tier 1 common, which is defined as Tier 1 capital less elements of Tier 1 capital not in the form of common equity, such as perpetual preferred stock, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and trust preferred securities. In 2013, the Federal Reserve employed a minimum 5% Tier 1 common ratio standard for CCAR purposes, in addition to other minimum capital requirements, to assess a bank holding company's capital adequacy. For the 2014 CCAR process, the Federal Reserve has introduced a requirement to include, in addition to the Basel I Tier 1 common standards, a Basel III Tier 1 common test with a minimum of 4% for 2014 projections and 4.5% for 2015 projections.Basel I and Basel 2.5The minimum U.S. risk-based capital requirements in effect on December 31, 2013, follow the Capital Accord (&#8220;Basel I&#8221;) of the Basel Committee. In June 2012, U.S. federal banking agencies published the final rule that specifies revised market risk regulatory capital requirements (&#8220;Basel 2.5&#8221;). While the Firm is still subject to the capital requirements of Basel I, Basel 2.5 rules also became effective for the Firm on January 1, 2013. The Basel 2.5 final rule revised the scope of positions subject to the market risk capital requirements and introduced new market risk measures, which resulted in additional capital requirements for covered positions as defined. The implementation of Basel 2.5 in the first quarter of 2013 resulted in an increase of approximately $150 billion in RWA compared with the Basel I rules at March 31, 2013. The implementation of these rules also resulted in decreases of the Firm's Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 common capital ratios by 140 basis points, 160 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, at March&#160;31, 2013.Management's discussion and analysisA reconciliation of total stockholders' equity to Tier 1 common, Tier 1 capital and Total qualifying capital is presented in the table below.&nbsp;Capital rollforwardThe following table presents the changes in Basel I Tier 1 common, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital for the year ended December 31, 2013.RWA RollforwardThe following table presents the changes in the credit risk and market risk components of RWA under Basel I including Basel 2.5 for the year ended December 31, 2013. The rollforward categories are estimates, based on the predominant driver of the change.The following table presents the risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase at December 31, 2013 and&#160;2012, under Basel I (and, for December 31, 2013, inclusive of Basel 2.5)(a) The Tier 1 common ratio is Tier 1 common capital divided by RWA.At December 31, 2013 and 2012, JPMorgan Chase maintained Basel I Tier 1 and Total capital ratios in excess of the well-capitalized standards established by the Federal Reserve. In addition, at December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Firm's Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was significantly above the 2013 5% CCAR standard.Additional information regarding the Firm's capital ratios and the federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject is presented in Note 28 on pages 316&#8211;318&#32;of this Annual Report and the Supervision and Regulation section of the 2013 10-K. For further information on the Firm's Basel 2.5 measures and additional market risk disclosures, see the Firm's consolidated Basel 2.5 Market Risk Pillar 3 Reports which are available on the Firm's website (http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/basel.cfm) within 60 days after December 31, 2013.&nbsp;Basel II & Basel IIIU.S. banking regulators published a final Basel II rule in December 2007, which was intended to be more risk sensitive than Basel I and eventually replace Basel I for large and internationally active U.S. banks, including the Firm. The Firm has been reporting Basel II capital ratios in parallel to the banking agencies since 2008. In October 2013, U.S. federal banking agencies published an interim final rule implementing further revisions to the Capital Accord in the U.S.; such further revisions are commonly referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Basel III is comprised of a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach. For large and internationally active banks, including the Firm, both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced Approaches became effective commencing January 1, 2014. For 2014, the Basel III Standardized Approach requires the Firm to calculate its capital ratios using the Basel III definition of capital divided by the Basel I definition of RWA, inclusive of Basel 2.5 for market risk. Commencing January 1, 2015 the Basel III Standardized Approach requires the Firm to calculate the ratios using the Basel III definition of capital divided by the Basel III Standardized RWA, inclusive of Basel 2.5 for market risk.Prior to full implementation of the Basel III Advanced Approach, the Firm is required to complete a qualification period (&#8220;parallel run&#8221;) of at least four consecutive quarters (inclusive of quarters in which the Firm reported in parallel under Basel II) during which it needs to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of its U.S. banking regulators. Pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Firm, upon exiting the Basel III Advanced Approach parallel run, will be required to calculate regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Firm's capital adequacy will be evaluated against the approach that results in the lower ratio. Basel III revises Basel I and II by, among other things, narrowing the definition of capital, and increasing capital requirements for specific exposures. Basel III introduces a new Tier 1 common ratio requirement which has a phase-in period from 2015 to 2019. By January 1, 2019, the minimum Tier 1 common ratio requirement is 7%, comprised of a minimum ratio of 4.5% plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer.Global systemically important banks (&#8220;GSIBs&#8221;) will also be required to maintain Tier 1 common requirements above the 7% minimum, in amounts ranging from an additional 1% to an additional 2.5%. In November 2013, the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;) indicated that it would require the Firm, as well as one other bank, to hold the additional 2.5% of Tier 1 common; the requirement will be phased in beginning in 2016. The Basel Committee also stated that certain GSIBs could be required to hold as much as an additional 3.5% of Tier 1 common above the 7% minimum if they were to take actions that further increase their systemic importance. Currently, no GSIB (including the Management's discussion and analysisFirm) is required to hold more than the additional 2.5% of Tier 1 common.In addition, Basel III establishes a 6.5% Tier I common equity standard for the definition of &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; &nbsp;under the Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;). The Tier I common equity standard is effective from the first quarter of 2015.The following chart presents the Basel III minimum risk-based capital ratios during the transitional periods and on a fully phased-in basis. The chart also includes management's target for the Firm's Tier 1 common ratio. It is the Firm's current expectation that its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will exceed the regulatory minimums, both during the transition period and upon full implementation in 2019 and thereafter.The Firm estimates that its Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approach on a fully phased-in basis would be 9.5%&#32;as of December 31, 2013, achieving management's previously stated objectives. The Tier 1 common ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach is estimated at 9.4% as of December 31, 2013. The Tier 1 common ratio under both Basel I and Basel III are non-GAAP financial measures. However, such measures are used by bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other financial services companies.The following table presents a comparison of the Firm's Tier 1 common under Basel I rules to its estimated Tier 1 common under the Advanced Approach of the Basel III rules, along with the Firm's estimated risk-weighted assets. Key differences in the calculation of RWA between Basel I and Basel III Advanced Approach include: (1) Basel III credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas Basel I RWA is based on fixed supervisory risk-weightings which vary only by counterparty type and asset class; and (2) Basel III includes RWA for operational risk, whereas Basel I does not. Operational risk capital takes into consideration operational losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally incorporates such losses irrespective of whether the issues or business activity giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced. The Firm's&#32;&nbsp;operational risk capital model continues to be refined in conjunction with the Firm's Basel III Advanced Approach parallel run. As a result of model enhancements in 2013, as well as taking into consideration the legal expenses incurred by the Firm in 2013, the Firm's operational risk capital increased substantially in 2013 over 2012.Tier 1 common under Basel III includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in Basel I Tier 1 common, such as the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) related to AFS securities and defined benefit pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans.Additionally, the Firm estimates that its Tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approach on a fully phased-in basis would be 10.2%&#32;as of December 31, 2013. The Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach on a fully phased-in basis is estimated at 10.1% as of December 31, 2013.Management's current objective is for the Firm to reach an estimated Basel III Tier I common ratio of 10%+ and a Basel III Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.0%, both by the end of 2014. Tier 1 common capital and the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios under Basel III are all non-GAAP financial measures. However, such measures are used by bank regulators, investors and analysts to assess the Firm's capital position and to compare the Firm's capital to that of other financial services companies.The Basel III interim final rule also includes a requirement for advanced approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate a supplementary leverage ratio (&#8220;SLR&#8221;). The SLR, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm's total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm's total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives future exposure.Following approval of the Basel III interim final rule, the U.S. banking agencies issued proposed rulemaking relating to the SLR that would require U.S. bank holding companies, including JPMorgan Chase, to have a minimum SLR of at least 5% and insured depository institutions (&#8220;IDI&#8221;), including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase&#160;Bank&#160;USA,&#160;N.A., to have a minimum SLR of at least 6%. The Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are not required to meet the minimum SLR until January 1, 2018. The Firm estimates, based on its current understanding of the U.S. rules, that if the rules were in effect at December 31, 2013, the Firm's SLR would have been approximately 4.7% and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s SLR would have been approximately 4.7%. Management's current objective is to achieve an SLR of 5.5% for the Firm and an SLR of 6% for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, each in advance of the SLR effective date.On January 12, 2014, the Basel Committee issued a revised framework for the calculation of the denominator of the SLR. The estimated impact of these revisions would have been to reduce each of the Firm's SLR and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s SLR by 10 basis points as of December 31, 2013.The Firm's estimates of its Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III and of the Firm's and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s SLR reflect its current understanding of the U.S. Basel III rules &nbsp;based on the current published rules and on the application of such rules to its businesses as currently conducted. The actual impact on the Firm's capital and SLR ratios at the effective date of the rules may differ from the Firm's current estimates depending on changes the Firm may make to its businesses in the future, further implementation guidance from the regulators, and regulatory approval of certain of the Firm's internal risk models (or, alternatively, regulatory disapproval of the Firm's internal risk models&#160;that have previously been conditionally approved). Economic risk capitalEconomic risk capital is another of the disciplines the Firm uses to assess the capital required to support its businesses. Economic risk capital is a measure of the capital needed to cover JPMorgan Chase's business activities in the event of unexpected losses.&#160;The Firm measures economic risk capital using internal risk-assessment methodologies and models based primarily on four risk factors: credit, market, operational and private equity risk and considers factors, assumptions and inputs that differ from those required to be used for regulatory capital requirements. Accordingly economic risk capital provides a complementary measure to regulatory capital.&#160;As economic risk capital is a separate component of the capital framework for Advanced Approach banking organizations under Basel III, the Firm is currently in the process of enhancing its economic risk capital framework to address the Basel III interim final rule.Line of business equityThe Firm's framework for allocating capital to its business segments is based on the following objectives:Equity for a line of business represents the amount the Firm believes the business would require if it were operating independently, considering capital levels for similarly rated peers, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III) and economic risk measures. Capital is also allocated to each line of business for, among other things, goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment's performance. Management's discussion and analysisEffective January 1, 2012, the Firm revised the capital allocated to each of its businesses, reflecting each segment's Basel III Tier 1 common capital requirements.Effective January 1, 2013, the Firm further refined the capital allocation framework to align it with the revised line of business structure that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in equity levels for the lines of businesses was largely driven by the evolving regulatory requirements and higher capital targets the Firm has established under the Basel III Advanced Approach.Effective January 1, 2014, the Firm further revised the capital allocated to certain businesses and will continue to assess the level of capital required for each line of business, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital to the business segments. Further refinements may be implemented in future periods.Capital actionsDividendsOn March 18, 2011, the Board of Directors increased the Firm's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.25 per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2011, to shareholders of record on April 6, 2011.On March 13, 2012, the Board of Directors increased the Firm's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.25 to $0.30 per share, effective with the dividend paid on April 30, 2012, to shareholders of record on April 5, 2012.On May 21, 2013, the Board of Directors increased the Firm's quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 to $0.38 per share, effective with the dividend paid on July&#160;31,&#160;2013, to shareholders of record on July 5, 2013. The Firm's common stock dividend policy reflects JPMorgan&#160;Chase's earnings outlook, desired dividend payout ratio, capital objectives, and alternative investment opportunities.The Firm's current expectation is to continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 30% of normalized earnings over time.For information regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22 and Note 27 on pages 309&#32;and 316, respectively, of this Annual Report.&nbsp;The following table shows the common dividend payout ratio based on reported net income.Preferred stockOn August 27, 2012, the Firm issued $1.3 billion of fixed&#8211;rate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. On February 5, 2013 the Firm issued $900 million of noncumulative preferred stock. On each of April 23, 2013, and July 29, 2013, the Firm issued $1.5 billion of noncumulative preferred stock. The Firm redeemed all $1.8 billion of its outstanding 8.625% noncumulative preferred stock, Series J on September 1, 2013. On January 22, 2014, January 30, 2014, and February 6, 2014, the Firm issued $2.0 billion, $850 million, and $75 million, respectively, of noncumulative preferred stock. For additional information on the Firm's preferred stock, see Note 22 on page 309&#32;of this Annual Report.Redemption of outstanding trust preferred securitiesOn May 8, 2013, the Firm redeemed approximately $5.0&#160;billion, or 100% of the liquidation amount, of the following eight series of trust preferred securities: JPMorgan Chase Capital X, XI, XII, XIV, XVI, XIX, XXIV, and BANK ONE Capital VI. For a further discussion of trust preferred securities, see Note 21 on pages 306&#8211;308&#32;of this Annual Report.Common equity repurchasesOn March&#160;13, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a $15.0 billion&#32;common equity (i.e., common stock and warrants) repurchase program. The amount of equity that may be repurchased is also subject to the amount that is set forth in the Firm's annual capital plan that is submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process. As part of this authorization, and in conjunction with the Firm's 2013 CCAR submission, the Board of Directors authorized the Firm to repurchase up to $6 billion gross of common equity commencing with the second quarter of 2013 through the end of the first quarter of 2014. From April 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, the Firm repurchased $2.2 billion of common equity. The following table shows the Firm's repurchases of common equity for the years ended&#32;December&#160;31, 2013, 2012&#32;and 2011, on a trade-date basis. As of December&#160;31, 2013, $8.6 billion&#32;of authorized repurchase capacity remained under the $15.0 billion repurchase program. The Firm may, from time to time, enter into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it would not otherwise be repurchasing common equity &#8212; for example, during internal trading &#8220;black-out periods.&#8221; All purchases under a Rule 10b5-1 plan must be made according to a predefined plan established when the Firm is not aware of material nonpublic information.The authorization to repurchase common equity will be utilized at management's discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time.For additional information regarding repurchases of the Firm's equity securities, see Part II, Item 5: Market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities on pages 20&#8211;21&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Form 10-K.&nbsp;Broker-dealer regulatory capitalJPMorgan Chase's principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (&#8220;JPMorgan Securities&#8221;) and J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. (&#8220;JPMorgan Clearing&#8221;). JPMorgan&#160;Clearing is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Securities and provides clearing and settlement services. JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are each subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Net Capital Rule&#8221;). JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing are also each registered as futures commission merchants and subject to Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;).JPMorgan Securities and JPMorgan Clearing have elected to compute their minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the &#8220;Alternative Net Capital Requirements&#8221; of the Net Capital Rule. At December 31, 2013, JPMorgan&#160;Securities' net capital, as defined by the Net Capital Rule, was $12.9 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $10.8 billion, and JPMorgan Clearing's net capital was $7.1 billion, exceeding the minimum requirement by $5.3 billion.In addition to its minimum net capital requirement, JPMorgan Securities is required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) in the event that tentative net capital is less than $5.0&#160;billion, in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule. As of December 31, 2013, JPMorgan Securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.J.P. Morgan Securities plc (formerly J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd.) is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#160;and is the Firm's principal operating subsidiary in the U.K. It has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P.&#160;Morgan&#160;Securities&#160;plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (&#8220;PRA&#8221;) and Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) (together, formerly the U.K. Financial Services Authority). During the fourth quarter of 2013, J.P. Morgan Securities plc received a capital contribution of $3.3 billion from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which was made to cover the anticipated capital requirements related to the introduction of Basel III rules, to which J.P. Morgan Securities plc is subject beginning January 1, 2014. Following this capital contribution, at December 31, 2013, J.P. Morgan Securities plc had total capital of $26.5 billion, or a Pillar 1 Total capital ratio of 18.1%, which exceeded the 8% well-capitalized standard applicable to it under Basel 2.5. Management's discussion and analysisLiquidity risk management is intended to ensure that the Firm has the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity in support of its assets. The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to ensure that the Firm's core businesses are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent obligations through normal economic cycles, as well as during market stress events, and to maintain debt ratings that enable the Firm to optimize its funding mix and liquidity sources while minimizing costs. The Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach in order to optimize liquidity sources and uses for the Firm as a whole, monitor exposures, identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity among legal entities within the Firm, and maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity as part of the Firm's overall balance sheet management strategy.In the context of the Firm's liquidity management, Treasury is responsible for:The Firm has a liquidity risk governance framework to review, approve and monitor the implementation of liquidity risk policies at the firmwide, regional and line of business levels.Specific risk committees responsible for liquidity risk governance include ALCO as well as lines of business and regional asset and liability management committees, and the CTC Risk Committee. For further discussion of the risk committees, see Enterprise-wide Risk Management on pages 113&#8211;173&#32;of this Annual Report. In addition, during 2013, the Firm established an independent liquidity risk oversight function reporting into the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (&#8220;CTC&#8221;) CRO, which provides independent assessments and monitoring of liquidity risk across the Firm.&nbsp;Management considers the Firm's liquidity position to be strong as of December&#160;31, 2013, and believes that the Firm's unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.LCR and NSFRIn December 2010, the Basel Committee introduced two new measures of liquidity risk: the liquidity coverage ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), which is intended to measure the amount of &#8220;high-quality liquid assets&#8221; (&#8220;HQLA&#8221;) held by the Firm in relation to estimated net cash outflows within a 30-day period during an acute stress event; and the net stable funding ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;) which is intended to measure the &#8220;available&#8221; amount of stable funding relative to the &#8220;required&#8221; amount of stable funding over a one-year horizon. The standards require that the LCR be no lower than 100% and the NSFR be greater than 100%. In January 2013, the Basel Committee introduced certain amendments to the formulation of the LCR, and a revised timetable to phase in the standard. The LCR will continue to become effective on January 1, 2015, but the minimum requirement will begin at 60%, increasing in equal annual increments to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2013, the Firm was compliant with the Basel III LCR. The LCR may fluctuate from period-to-period due to normal flows from client activity.On October 24, 2013, the U.S. banking regulators released a proposal to implement a U.S. quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with, but more conservative than, Basel III LCR for large banks and bank holding companies(&#8220;U.S. LCR&#8221;). The proposal also provides for an accelerated transition period compared to that which is currently required under the Basel III LCR rules. At December 31, 2013, the Firm was also compliant with the U.S. LCR based on its current understanding of the proposed rules. On January 12, 2014, the Basel Committee released proposed revisions to the NSFR. Based on its current understanding of the proposed revisions, the Firm was compliant with the NSFR as of December 31, 2013. FundingSources of fundsThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including a stable deposit franchise as well as secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets. The Firm's loan portfolio, aggregating approximately $722.2 billion, net of allowance, at December&#160;31, 2013, is funded with a portion of the Firm's deposits&#160;(aggregating approximately $1,287.8 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013), and&#160;through&#160;securitizations and, with respect to a portion of the Firm's real estate-related loans, with secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks.&#160;Deposits in excess of the amount utilized to fund loans are primarily invested in the Firm's investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics. Capital markets secured financing assets and trading assets are primarily funded by the Firm's capital market secured financing liabilities, trading liabilities and a portion of the Firm's long-term debt and equity.In addition to funding capital markets assets, proceeds from the Firm's debt and equity issuances are used to fund certain loans, and other financial and non-financial assets, or may be invested in the Firm's investment securities portfolio. See the discussion below for additional disclosures relating to Deposits, Short-term funding, and Long-term funding and issuance.&nbsp;DepositsA key strength of the Firm is its diversified deposit franchise, through each of its lines of business, which provides a stable source of funding and limits reliance on the wholesale funding markets. As of December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm's loans-to-deposits ratio was 57%, compared with 61%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012.As of December&#160;31, 2013, total deposits for the Firm were $1,287.8 billion, compared with $1,193.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012 (58%&#32;and 55%&#32;of total liabilities at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively). The increase was due to growth in both wholesale and consumer deposits. For further information, see Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 75&#8211;76&#32;of this Annual Report.The Firm typically experiences higher customer deposit inflows at period-ends. Therefore, the Firm believes average deposit balances are more representative of deposit trends. The table below summarizes, by line of business, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012.A significant portion of the Firm's deposits are consumer deposits (36%&#32;and 37%&#32;at December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, respectively), which are considered particularly stable as they are less sensitive to interest rate changes or market volatility. Additionally, the majority of the Firm's institutional deposits are also considered to be stable sources of funding since they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm. For further discussions of deposit and liability balance trends, see the discussion of the results for the Firm's business segments and the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 86&#8211;111&#32;and 75&#8211;76, respectively, of this Annual Report.Management's discussion and analysisThe following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012, and average balances for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. For additional information, see the Balance Sheet Analysis on pages 75&#8211;76&#32;and Note 21 on pages 306&#8211;308&#32;of this Annual Report.Short-term fundingA significant portion of the Firm's total commercial paper liabilities, approximately 70%&#32;as of December&#160;31, 2013, are not sourced from wholesale funding markets, but were originated from deposits that customers choose to sweep into commercial paper liabilities as a cash management program offered to customers of the Firm.The Firm's sources of short-term secured funding primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt, agency debt and agency MBS, and constitute a significant &nbsp;portion of the federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under purchase agreements. The amounts of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at December&#160;31, 2013, decreased predominantly due to a change in the mix of the Firm's funding sources. The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers' investment and financing activities; the Firm's demand for financing; the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm's liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment and market-making portfolios); and other market and portfolio factors.Long-term funding and issuanceLong-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm's long-term funding plan is driven by expected client activity and the liquidity required to support this activity. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding cost, as well as maintaining a certain level of pre-funding at the parent holding company. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The majority of the Firm's long-term unsecured funding is issued by the parent holding company to provide maximum flexibility in support of both bank and nonbank subsidiary funding. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemption for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012. For additional information, see Note 21 on pages 306&#8211;308&#32;of this Annual Report.In addition, from January 1, 2014, through February 19, 2014, the Firm issued $12.7 billion of senior notes. The Firm raises secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and advances from the FHLBs. It may also in the future raise long-term funding through securitization of residential mortgages, auto loans and student loans, which will increase funding and investor diversity.&nbsp;The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemption for the years ended December&#160;31, 2013&#32;and 2012. On January 27, 2014, the Firm securitized $1.8 billion of consumer credit card loans.The Firm's wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. For further description of the client-driven loan securitizations, see Note 16 on pages 288&#8211;299&#32;of this Annual Report.Parent holding company and subsidiary fundingThe parent holding company acts as an important source of funding to its subsidiaries. The Firm's liquidity management is intended to ensure that liquidity at the parent holding company is maintained at levels sufficient to fund the operations of the parent holding company and its subsidiaries for an extended period of time in a stress environment where access to normal funding sources is disrupted.To effectively monitor the adequacy of liquidity and funding at the parent holding company, the Firm uses three primary measures:Management's discussion and analysisensure sufficient liquidity for the Firm in a stressed environment. The Firm's liquidity management takes into consideration its subsidiaries' ability to generate replacement funding in the event the parent holding company requires repayment of the aforementioned deposits and advances. For further information, see the Stress testing discussion below.HQLAHQLA is the estimated amount of assets the Firm believes will qualify for inclusion in the Basel III LCR. HQLA primarily consists of cash and certain unencumbered high quality, liquid assets as defined in the rule.As of December&#160;31, 2013, HQLA was estimated to be approximately $522 billion, compared with $341 billion as of December 31, 2012. The increase in HQLA was due to higher cash balances primarily driven by increased deposits and long-term debt issuance, as well as by a reduction in trading assets. HQLA may fluctuate from period-to-period due to normal flows from client activity.The following table presents the estimated Basel III LCR HQLA broken out by HQLA-eligible cash and HQLA-eligible securities as of December&#160;31, 2013. In addition to HQLA, as of December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm has approximately $282 billion of unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, available to raise liquidity, if required. Furthermore, the Firm maintains borrowing capacity at various FHLBs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and various other central banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks. Although available, the Firm does not view the borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the various other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. As of December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm's remaining borrowing capacity at various FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window was approximately $109 billion. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of securities included above in HQLA or other unencumbered securities held at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for which the Firm has not drawn liquidity.&nbsp;Stress testingLiquidity stress tests are intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Firm under a variety of adverse scenarios. Results of stress tests are therefore considered in the formulation of the Firm's funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range of time horizons and varying degrees of market and idiosyncratic stress. Standard stress tests are performed on a regular basis and ad hoc stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Stress scenarios are produced for the parent holding company and the Firm's major subsidiaries. In addition, separate regional liquidity stress testing is performed.Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm's contractual obligations are met and then take into consideration varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets. Additionally, assumptions with respect to potential non-contractual and contingent outflows include, but are not limited to, the following:Contingency funding planThe Firm's contingency funding plan (&#8220;CFP&#8221;), which is reviewed and approved by ALCO, provides a documented framework for managing both temporary and longer-term unexpected adverse liquidity stress. The CFP incorporates the limits and indicators set by the Liquidity Risk Oversight group. These limits and indicators are reviewed regularly to identify emerging risks or increased vulnerabilities in the Firm's liquidity position. The CFP is also regularly updated to identify alternative contingent liquidity resources that can be accessed under adverse liquidity circumstances.Credit ratingsThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm's access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. Additionally, the Firm's funding requirements for VIEs and other third &nbsp;party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. For additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements, see Special-purpose entities on page 77, and Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 6 on pages 220&#8211;233, of this Annual ReportThe credit ratings of the parent holding company and certain of the Firm's significant operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013, were as follows.On June 11, 2013, S&P announced a reassessment of the government support assumptions reflected in its holding company ratings of eight systemically important financial institutions, including the Firm. As a result of this reassessment, the outlook for the parent company was revised to negative from stable; the outlook for the Firm's operating subsidiaries remained unchanged at stable.On November 14, 2013, Moody's downgraded the Firm and several other bank holding companies based on Moody's reassessment of its assumptions relating to implicit government support for such companies. Specifically, Moody's downgraded the senior and subordinated debt ratings of JPMorgan Chase and Co., and the subordinated debt rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and upgraded the long-term issuer rating of JPMorgan Securities. The parent company downgrade also resulted in Moody's downgrade of the parent company's short-term rating. The rating actions did not have a material adverse impact on the Firm's cost of funds or its ability to fund itself.Additional downgrades of the Firm's long-term ratings by one notch or two notches could result in a further downgrade of the Firm's short-term ratings. If this were to occur, the Firm believes its cost of funds could increase and access to certain funding markets could be reduced. The nature and magnitude of the impact of further ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and&#32;&nbsp;behavioral factors (which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics). The Firm believes it maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to further ratings downgrades. JPMorgan Chase's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support, future profitability, risk management practices, and legal expenses, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. Although the Firm closely monitors and endeavors to manage factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that its credit ratings will not be further changed in the future.Management's discussion and analysisJPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment to ascertain the value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant valuation judgments. Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase's allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm's consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm's loan assets to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date.The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component, a formula-based component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters, as discussed below. For further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm's allowance for credit losses, see Note 15 on pages 284&#8211;287&#32;of this Annual Report.Asset-specific componentThe asset-specific allowance for loan losses for each of the Firm's portfolio segments is generally measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the impaired loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections further rely upon estimates such as redefault rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the level of future home prices, the duration of current overall economic conditions, and other macroeconomic and portfolio-specific factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.&nbsp;Formula-based component - Consumer loans and lending-related commitments, excluding PCI loansThe formula-based allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including credit card, is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors to outstanding principal balances over an estimated loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses in the portfolio. The loss emergence period represents the time period between the date at which the loss is estimated to have been incurred and the ultimate realization of that loss (through a charge-off). Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. In addition, management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for each loan portfolio category, using delinquency trends and other risk characteristics to estimate the total incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Management uses additional statistical methods and considers portfolio and collateral valuation trends to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical loss estimate.The statistical calculation is then adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. However, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, the potential impact of payment recasts within the HELOC portfolio, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. For example, the performance of a HELOC that experiences a payment recast may be affected by both the quality of underwriting standards applied in originating the loan and the general economic conditions in effect at the time of the payment recast. For junior lien products, management considers the delinquency and/or modification status of any senior liens in determining the adjustment. The application of different inputs into the statistical calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the statistical calculation, are subject to management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for the consumer credit portfolio.Overall, the allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including credit card, is sensitive to changes in the economic environment (e.g., unemployment rates), delinquency rates, the realizable value of collateral (e.g., housing prices), FICO scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors. While all of these factors are important determinants of overall allowance levels, changes in the various factors may not occur at the same time or at the same rate, or changes may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in the other. In addition, changes in these factors would not necessarily be consistent across all geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predict the extent to which changes in these factors would ultimately affect the frequency of losses, the severity of losses or both.PCI loansIn connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain PCI loans, which are accounted for as described in Note 14 on pages 258&#8211;283&#32;of this Annual Report. The allowance for loan losses for the PCI portfolio is based on quarterly estimates of the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated remaining lives of the loans.These cash flow projections are based on estimates regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. These estimates are dependent on assumptions regarding the level of future home price declines, and the duration of current overall economic conditions, among other factors. These estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.Formula-based component - Wholesale loans and lending-related commitmentsThe Firm's methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments requires the early identification of credits that are deteriorating. The Firm uses a risk-rating system to determine the credit quality of its wholesale loans. Wholesale loans are reviewed for information affecting the obligor's ability to fulfill its obligations. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the obligor's debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor's earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could affect the risk rating assigned by the Firm to that loan.&nbsp;The Firm applies its judgment to establish loss factors used in calculating the allowances. Wherever possible, the Firm uses independent, verifiable data or the Firm's own historical loss experience in its models for estimating the allowances. Many factors can affect estimates of loss, including volatility of loss given default, probability of default and rating migrations. Consideration is given to the particular source of external data used as well as the time period to which loss data relates (for example, point-in-time loss estimates and estimates that reflect longer views of the credit cycle). Finally, differences in loan characteristics between the Firm's specific loan portfolio and those reflected in the external data could also affect loss estimates. The application of different inputs would change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by the Firm.Management also applies its judgment to adjust the modeled loss estimates, taking into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss factors. Historical experience of both loss given default and probability of default are considered when estimating these adjustments. Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated where relevant. These estimates are based on management's view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio.Allowance for credit losses sensitivityAs noted above, the Firm's allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm's assumptions could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. For example, deterioration in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm's modeled loss estimates as of December&#160;31, 2013, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm's allowance for loan losses:Management's discussion and analysisThe purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management's expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors.These analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then current circumstances and conditions.It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows in evaluating the risk factors related to its loans, including risk ratings, home price assumptions, and credit card loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit loss is appropriate.Fair value of financial instruments, MSRs and commodities inventoryJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.&nbsp;Assets measured at fair valueThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. For further information, see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of thisAnnual Report.ValuationFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Firm has established well-documented processes for determining fair value; for further details see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally based on models that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters.Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate model to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs &#8212; including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. For further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used, see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report.For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm's credit-worthiness, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. During the fourth quarter of 2013 the Firm implemented the FVA framework to incorporate the impact of funding into its valuation estimates for OTC derivatives and structured notes, reflecting an industry migration towards incorporating the market cost of unsecured funding in the valuation of such instruments. Implementation of the FVA framework required a number of important management judgments including: (i) determining when the accumulation of market evidence was sufficiently compelling to implement the FVA framework; (ii) estimating the market clearing price for funding in the relevant market; and (iii) determining the interaction between DVA and FVA, given that DVA already reflects credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding spreads that drive FVA.&#32;For further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm, including FVA, see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. For a detailed discussion of the Firm's valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 on pages 195&#8211;215&#32;of this Annual Report.&nbsp;Goodwill impairmentUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm's process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report.Management applies significant judgment when estimating the fair value of its reporting units. Estimates of fair value are dependent upon estimates of (a) the future earnings potential of the Firm's reporting units, including the estimated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, such as the Dodd-Frank Act , (b) long-term growth rates and (c) the relevant cost of equity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units.Based upon the updated valuations for all of its reporting units, the Firm concluded that goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired at December 31, 2013, nor was any goodwill written off during 2013. The fair values of almost all of the Firm's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations. For those reporting units where fair value exceeded carrying value, the excess fair value as a percent of carrying value ranged from approximately 15% to 180%.As of December 31, 2013, the estimated fair value of the Firm's mortgage lending business within CCB did not exceed its carrying value. While the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to the mortgage lending business exceeded its carrying value as of December 31, 2013, the associated goodwill remains at an elevated risk for goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk and the effects of economic, regulatory and legislative changes. The assumptions used in the valuation of this business include: (a) estimates of future cash flows for the business (which are dependent on outstanding loan balances, net interest margin, operating expense, credit losses and the amount of capital necessary to meet regulatory capital requirements), and (b) the cost of equity used to discount those cash flows to a present value. Each of these factors requires significant judgment and the assumptions used are based on management's current best estimate and most current projections, including the anticipated effects of regulatory and legislative changes, derived from the Firm's business forecasting process as reviewed with senior management.The projections for all of the Firm's reporting units are consistent with the short-term assumptions discussed in the Business Outlook on pages 68&#8211;69&#32;of this Annual Report, and, in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm's best estimates of long-term growth and returns of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.Management's discussion and analysisDeterioration in economic market conditions, increased estimates of the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes, or additional regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in projected business performance beyond management's current expectations. For example, in the Firm's mortgage lending business, such declines could result from increases in primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, higher costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters or from deterioration in economic conditions that result in increased credit losses, including decreases in home prices beyond management's current expectations. Declines in business performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.For additional information on goodwill, see Note 17 on pages 299&#8211;304&#32;of this Annual Report.Income taxesJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.JPMorgan Chase's interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional reserves as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations and tax planning strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm's estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm's results of operations in any reporting period.&nbsp;The Firm's provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain net operating losses. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management's estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also incorporates various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize net operating losses before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December&#160;31, 2013, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.JPMorgan Chase does not provide U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time. Changes to the income tax rates applicable to these non-U.S. subsidiaries may have a material impact on the effective tax rate in a future period if such changes were to occur.The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when additional information becomes available. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.For additional information on income taxes, see Note 26 on pages 313&#8211;315&#32;of this Annual Report.Litigation reservesFor a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves, see Note 31 on pages 326&#8211;332&#32;of this Annual Report.Presentation of other comprehensive incomeIn June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that modifies the presentation of other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The guidance requires that items of net income, items of other comprehensive income, and total comprehensive income be presented in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. The guidance was effective in the first quarter of 2012, and the Firm adopted the new guidance by electing the two-statement approach, effective January 1, 2012. The application of this guidance only affected the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures of any reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance was effective in the first quarter of 2013. The application of this guidance had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. For further information, see Note 25 on page 312&#32;of this Annual Report.Balance sheet nettingIn December 2011, the FASB issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures about certain financial assets and liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting agreements or similar agreements, or that have otherwise been offset on the balance sheet under certain specific conditions that permit net presentation. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of this guidance is limited to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. The Firm adopted the new guidance effective the first quarter of 2013. The application of this guidance had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations. For further information, see Notes 1, 6, and 13 on pages 189&#8211;191, 220&#8211;233, and 255&#8211;257, respectively, of this Annual Report. Investment companiesIn June 2013, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the characteristics of an investment company and requires new disclosures for investment companies. Under the guidance, a company regulated under the Investment Company Act of &nbsp;1940 is considered an investment company for accounting purposes. All other companies must meet all of the fundamental characteristics described in the guidance and consider other typical characteristics to qualify as an investment company.
