>Note 7&#32;&#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note&#32;8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.&#32;99Note 8&#32;&#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, see Note&#32;9 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $15.9 billion&#32;and $3.6 billion, as of March 31, 2016, and $16.0 billion&#32;and $3.5 billion&#32;respectively, as of December 31, 2015. See Note 19&#32;for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three months ended March 31, 2016&#32;and 2015.&nbsp;The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2016&#32;at this time. For 2016, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $33 million. The 2016&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $47 million&#32;and $2 million, respectively. 100Note 9&#32;&#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note&#32;10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following&#32;noncash compensation expense related to&#32;its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income.In the first quarter of 2016, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2015 performance year,&#32;the Firm granted&#32;33 million&#32;RSUs and 926 thousand PSUs, all with a weighted-average grant date fair value of&#32;$57.24.PSU AwardsIn January 2016, the Firm's Board of Directors approved the grant of PSUs to members of the Firm's Operating Committee under the variable compensation program for performance year 2015. PSUs are subject to the Firm's achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero&#32;to 150%&#32;of the grant amount. The awards vest and are converted into shares of common stock in the quarter after the end of the three-year performance period. In addition, dividends will be notionally reinvested in the Firm's common stock and will be delivered only in respect of any earned shares. Once the PSUs have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of five&#32;years from the grant date.&nbsp;Note 10&#32;&#8211; Noninterest expenseFor details on Noninterest expense, see Consolidated statements of income on&#32;page 71. Included within&#32;other expense is the following:&#32;The Firm's legal expense was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and was $687 million&#32;for the three months ended March 31, 2015.101Note 11&#32;&#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as trading, AFS or held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;). Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note&#32;3. Predominantly all of&#32;the Firm's AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;) within the investment securities portfolio in connection with the Firm's asset-liability management objectives. At&#32;March 31, 2016, the investment securities &nbsp;portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of&#32;AA+&#32;(based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note&#32;12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.&#32;102Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.103Gross unrealized lossesThe Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell as an other-than-temporary impairment (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;).&#32;The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of March 31, 2016, and it is not likely that&#32;the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income,&#32;the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of March 31, 2016, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.&#32;For additional information on other-than-temporary impairment, see Note 12 of the JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and OTTI losses from AFS securities that were recognized in income.&#32;Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe cumulative credit loss component, including any changes therein, of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities was not material as of and during the three month periods ended March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015.104Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.&#32;105Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, see Note 4. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm's securities financing agreements, as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces, in the Firm's view, the economic exposure with&#32;the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as &#8220;Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,&#8221; and reduces the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; presented below, if the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.106The tables below present as of March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm held $5.8 billion&#32;and $7.5 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated balance sheets. 107Note 13&#32;&#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition.&#32;The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report. See Note&#32;4&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on&#32;the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note&#32;3&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by&#32;the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment,&#32;the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:The following tables summarize&#32;the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.&#32;108The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated.&#32;These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that&#32;the Firm reduces its credit exposures.&#32;The following table provides information about gains and losses, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, on loan sales by portfolio segment.&#32;Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.&#32;&nbsp;The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.109Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.&#32;110The following table represents&#32;the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.&nbsp;Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period.&#32;That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those&#32;products is higher than the minimum payment options&#32;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into&#32;the Firm's allowance for loan losses.&#32;Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.111The following&#32;table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by&#32;the Firm.Loan modificationsModifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;The following table presents new TDRs reported by&#32;the Firm.Nature and extent of modificationsThe U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;) programs, as well as&#32;the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following&#32;table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under&#32;the Firm's loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.112Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following&#32;table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under&#32;the Firm's loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.&#32;At&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 9 years&#32;for home equity and 10 years&#32;for residential mortgages.&#32;The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of&#32;$1.1 billion&#32;and $1.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;), but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.113Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.&#32;114Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.&#160;See Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.&#32;The following table provides information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March 31, 2016&#32;and 2015.115Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.116Approximately&#32;23%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs.&#32;The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.&nbsp;The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for&#32;the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015, and represents&#32;the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option adjustable-rate mortgage (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of&#32;$2.1 billion&#32;and $2.3 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.117Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's credit card loans.Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&#32;&nbsp;At March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, $104 million&#32;and $113 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $60 million&#32;and $66 million&#32;at March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.&#32;Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for&#32;60&#32;months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs.&#160;New enrollments in these loan modification programs were&#32;$159 million&#32;and $178 million, for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.&#32;For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become&#32;two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with&#32;the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for credit card loans modified was expected to be&#32;25.79%&#32;and 25.61%&#32;as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.&#32;118Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note&#32;14 and Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.&#32;119The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans consist of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents&#32;the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.&nbsp;Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. TDRs were $296 million&#32;and $208 million&#32;as of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.120Note 14&#32;&#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and related informationThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses, and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.&#32;121Note 15&#32;&#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs, see Note 1 of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on&#32;page 125&#32;of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm's primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 126&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans&#32;(including student loans) primarily in its&#32;CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved,&#32;the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of&#32;the Firm's involvement with&#32;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.122The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in&#32;Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by&#32;the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances,&#32;the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on&#32;page 127&#32;of this Note for further information regarding&#32;the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and&#32;page 127&#32;of this Note for information on&#32;the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies.123Residential mortgageFor a more detailed description of&#32;the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.At March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain&#32;Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which&#32;the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that&#32;the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on&#32;page 126&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB&#32;originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of&#32;the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report. See the table on&#32;page 126&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase'sparticipation in certain re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.During the three months ended March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015, the Firm transferred $2.9 billion&#32;and $3.9 billion&#32;respectively of securities to agency VIEs, and zero&#32;and $472 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $2.0 billion&#32;and $2.2 billion, respectively. At March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm held approximately $4.2 billion&#32;and $4.6 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities. The Firm's exposure to non-consolidated private-label re-securitization entities as of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015&#32;was not material. As of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm consolidated an insignificant amount of assets and liabilities of Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitizations.&nbsp;Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with&#32;Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.In the normal course of business,&#32;JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.&#32;The Firm held&#32;$18.6 billion&#32;and $15.7 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.&#32;The Firm's investments reflect&#32;the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.&#32;The Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by&#32;the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by&#32;the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded portion of these commitments was&#32;$8.6 billion&#32;and $5.6 billion&#32;at March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note&#32;21.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of&#32;JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.124The Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, was as follows.VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,&#32;remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where&#32;the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,&#32;the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.125Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by&#32;the Firm as of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans.&#32;For a&#32;further description of&#32;the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.126Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to&#32;the Firm's securitization activities for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015, related to assets held in&#32;JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by&#32;the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (&#8220;U.S. GSEs&#8221;), loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,&#32;the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans).&#32;The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.&#32;The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales,&#32;the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note&#32;29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report&#32;for additional information about&#32;the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note&#32;16&#32;for additional information about the impact of&#32;the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.&nbsp;127Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to&#32;the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note&#32;21, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements.&#32;The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When&#32;the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding &nbsp;liability. As of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated balance sheets&#32;$10.8 billion&#32;and $11.1 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which&#32;the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was&#32;$360 million&#32;and $343&#160;million&#32;as of March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note&#32;13&#32;of this Form 10-Q and Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.128Note 16&#32;&#8211; Goodwill and other intangible assetsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.&nbsp;Goodwill Impairment testingFor further description of the Firm's goodwill impairment testing process, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 274&#8211;275 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at March&#160;31, 2016, or December&#160;31, 2015, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2016&#32;or 2015.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse estimates of the impact of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.129Mortgage servicing rightsMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report&#32;and Note&#32;3&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015.130The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three months ended March 31, 2016&#32;and 2015.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of&#32;the Firm's MSRs at&#32;March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.131Note 17&#32;&#8211; DepositsFor further discussion on deposits, see Note&#32;19 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.At&#32;March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.&#32;&nbsp;Note 18&#32;&#8211; Earnings per shareFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), see Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2016&#32;and 2015.132Note 19&#32;&#8211; Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to&#32;the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and DVA on fair value option elected liabilities.&#32;Effective January 1, 2016, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of financial liabilities where the fair value option has been elected. This guidance requires the portion of the total change in fair value caused by changes in the Firm's own credit risk (DVA) to be presented separately in other comprehensive income; previously these amounts were recognized in net income. The guidance was required to be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to the Consolidated balance sheets, which resulted in a reclassification from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income. 133The following table presents the pretax and after-tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss).&#32;134Note 20&#32;&#8211; Regulatory capitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm's national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase&#160;Bank&#160;USA,&#160;N.A.Under the Basel Committee's most recent capital framework (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;) for large and internationally active U.S.&#32;bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (&#8220;IDI&#8221;) subsidiaries, revised, among other things, the definition of capital and introduced a new common equity Tier 1 capital (&#8220;CET1 capital&#8221;) requirement; presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), a general (Standardized) approach, (&#8220;Basel III Standardized&#8221;) and an advanced approach, (&#8220;Basel III Advanced&#8221;); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain of the requirements of Basel III are subject to phase-in periods that began on January 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (&#8220;Basel III Transitional&#8221;).There are three categories of risk-based capital under the Basel III Transitional rules: CET1 capital, as well as Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common&#32;stockholders' equity&#32;(including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS&#32;as well as for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans), less certain deductions for goodwill,&#32;MSRs&#32;and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital predominantly consists of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital.&#32;&nbsp;The following&#32;tables&#32;present&#32;the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for&#32;JPMorgan Chase and its significant national bank subsidiaries&#32;under both Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional. 135Note: Rating agencies allow measures of capital to be adjusted upward for deferred tax liabilities, which have resulted from both nontaxable business combinations and from tax-deductible goodwill. The Firm had deferred tax liabilities resulting from nontaxable business combinations totaling $100 million&#32;and $105 million&#32;at March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively; and deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax-deductible goodwill of $3.1 billion&#32;and $3.0 billion&#32;at March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.&nbsp;Under the risk-based capital&#32;guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum leverage ratio (which is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. National bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators.&#32;The following table presents the minimum ratios to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject as of March&#160;31, 2016.Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject. (a) Represents the transitional minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm under Basel III at March 31, 2016. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 0.625%&#32;resulting from the phase in of the Firm's 2.5%&#32;capital conservation buffer and 1.125%, resulting from the phase in of the Firm's estimated 4.5%&#32;GSIB surcharge as of December 31, 2014 published by the Federal Reserve on July 20, 2015. (b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase's banking subsidiaries. The CET1 minimum capital ratio includes 0.625%&#32;resulting from the phase in of the 2.5%&#32;capital conservation buffer that is applicable to the banking subsidiaries. The banking subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.(c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.As of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, JPMorgan Chase and all of its&#32;banking subsidiaries were&#32;well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.&#32;136Note 21&#32;&#8211; Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to&#32;the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or&#32;the Firm&#32;be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in&#32;the Firm's view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and&#32;the Firm's related accounting policies, see Note&#32;29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note&#32;14&#32;for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.&#32;The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products.&#32;The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.&#32;The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition,&#32;the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is&#32;60 days&#32;or more past due.&#32;The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.137138Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.&#32;Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged finance activities, which were&#32;$35.5 billion&#32;and&#32;$32.1 billion&#32;at&#32;March&#160;31, 2016,&#32;and&#32;December&#160;31, 2015, respectively.The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as &nbsp;settlement and custody bank,&#32;the Firm is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured clearance advance facilities that&#32;the Firm extends to its clients (i.e., cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit&#32;the Firm's&#32;intra-day credit risk to the facility amount&#32;and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of both&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was&#32;$2.9 billion.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLC&#8221;) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by&#32;the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.The following table summarizes the standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements&#32;as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit139Derivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above,&#32;the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note&#32;29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that&#32;the Firm deems to be guarantees was&#32;$53.2 billion&#32;and $53.8 billion&#32;at&#32;March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively. The notional amount generally represents&#32;the Firm's maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was&#32;$28.5 billion&#32;and $28.4 billion&#32;at&#32;March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was&#32;$3.0 billion&#32;at&#32;both March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether&#32;the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that&#32;the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of&#32;$212 million&#32;and $236 million&#32;at March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, respectively, and derivative receivables of&#32;$14 million&#32;at both March 31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015.&#32;The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee,&#32;the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note&#32;5.&nbsp;Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsIn connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs and in certain private label transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser. Further, although the Firm's securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. For additional information, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015&#32;Annual Report.Other off-balance sheet arrangementsGuarantees of subsidiaryJPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (&#8220;JPMFC&#8221;), a direct, 100%-owned finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;), was formed on September 30, 2015, for the purpose of issuing debt and other securities in offerings to investors. Any securities issued by JPMFC will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company, and these guarantees will rank on a parity with the Firm's unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.&#160;As of March 31, 2016, no securities had been issued by JPMFC.140Note 22&#32;&#8211; Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of&#32;the Firm's pledged assets and collateral, see Note&#32;30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Pledged assetsThe Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, and to cover customer short sales.&#32;Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated balance sheets. At&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had pledged assets of&#32;$396.6 billion&#32;and $385.6 billion, respectively, at Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLBs&#8221;).&#32;In addition, as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had pledged&#32;$54.8 billion&#32;and $50.7 billion, respectively, of financial assets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note&#32;15&#32;for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on&#32;the Firm's securities financing activities, see Note&#32;12. For additional information on&#32;the Firm's long-term debt, see Note&#32;21 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.CollateralAt&#32;March&#160;31, 2016, and December&#160;31, 2015, the Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of&#32;$808.2 billion&#32;and $748.5 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received,&#32;$643.2 billion&#32;and $580.9 billion, respectively, were sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used. Collateral was generally used under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover customer short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements.&nbsp;Note 23&#32;&#8211; LitigationContingenciesAs of March&#160;31, 2016, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0&#32;to approximately $3.5 billion&#32;at March&#160;31, 2016. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, particularly proceedings that could result from government investigations. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.Auto Dealer Regulatory Matter. The U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) is investigating potential statistical disparities in markups charged to borrowers of different races and ethnicities by automobile dealers on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by the Firm.CIO Litigation. The Firm has been sued in a consolidated shareholder class action, a consolidated putative class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) and seven&#32;shareholder derivative actions brought in Delaware state court and in New York federal and state courts relating to 2012 losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm's Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;). A settlement of the shareholder class action, under which the Firm will pay $150 million, has been preliminarily approved by the court. The putative ERISA class action has been dismissed, and the plaintiffs are 141appealing that dismissal. All of the shareholder derivative actions have been dismissed.Credit Default Swaps Investigations and Litigation.&#32;The Firm and other defendants have entered separate agreements to settle a consolidated class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers and sellers of credit default swaps (&#8220;CDS&#8221;). The complaint alleged that the defendant investment banks and dealers, including the Firm, as well as Markit Group Limited and/or the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, collectively prevented new entrants into the market for exchange-traded CDS products. These settlements have been approved by the Court.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.&#32;The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (&#8220;FX&#8221;) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX-related investigations and inquiries by other, non-U.S. government authorities, including competition authorities, remain ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with those matters.The Firm is also one of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.-based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the &#8220;U.S. class action&#8221;). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the &#8220;exchanged-based actions&#8221;), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the &#8220;consumer actions&#8221;), and participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the &#8220;ERISA actions&#8221;). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions, and that agreement has been preliminarily approved by the Court. The consumer actions and ERISA actions remain pending.In September 2015, two&#32;class actions were filed in Canada against the Firm as well as a number of other FX dealers, principally for alleged violations of the Canadian Competition Act based on an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of currency purchased in the FX market. The first action was filed in the province of Ontario, and seeks to represent all persons in Canada who transacted any FX instrument. The second action seeks to represent only those persons in Quebec who engaged in FX transactions.General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion&#32;syndicated Term Loan facility (&#8220;Term Loan&#8221;) for General Motors Corporation (&#8220;GM&#8221;).&#160;In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (&#8220;Creditors Committee&#8221;) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other &nbsp;lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of the Creditors Committee's claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the Bankruptcy Court seeking indemnification and asserting various claims.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The parties have entered into an agreement to settle the cases for a cash payment of $6.1 billion&#32;to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm's share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten&#32;basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight&#32;months to be measured from a date within 60 days&#32;of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network's rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and oral argument was held in September 2015. Certain merchants and trade associations have also filed a motion with the District Court seeking to set aside the approval of the class settlement on the basis of alleged improper communications between one&#32;of MasterCard's former outside counsel and one&#32;of plaintiffs' outside counsel. That motion remains pending. Certain merchants that opted out of the class settlement have filed actions against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending two&#32;pending cases that are being coordinated for pre-trial purposes, alleging that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management (&#8220;JPMIM&#8221;) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited claim that JPMIM is liable for total losses of more than $1 billion&#32;in market value of these securities. Discovery has been completed. In January 2016, plaintiffs filed a joint partial motion for summary judgment in the coordinated actions, which JPMIM has opposed.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (&#8220;LBHI&#8221;) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) filed a 142complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserted both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and sought, among other relief, to recover $7.9 billion&#32;in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI's bankruptcy. The amended complaint also sought unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s collateral requests hastened LBHI's bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Court dismissed the claims in the amended complaint that sought to void the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during September 2008, but did not dismiss the other claims, including claims for duress and fraud. The Firm filed counterclaims against LBHI, including alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large extensions of credit against inappropriate collateral in connection with the Firm's role as the clearing bank for Lehman Brothers Inc. (&#8220;LBI&#8221;), LBHI's broker-dealer subsidiary. In September 2015, the District Court, to which the case had been transferred from the Bankruptcy Court, granted summary judgment in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on most of the claims against it that the Bankruptcy Court had not previously dismissed, including the claims for duress and fraud. The District Court also denied LBHI's motion for summary judgment on certain of its claims and for dismissal of the Firm's counterclaims. The claims that remained following the District Court's ruling challenged the propriety of the Firm's post-petition payment, from collateral posted by LBHI, of approximately $1.9 billion&#32;of derivatives, repo and securities lending claims.In the Bankruptcy Court proceedings, LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors had filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. In January 2015, LBHI filed claims objections with respect to guaranty claims asserted by the Firm arising from close-outs of derivatives transactions with LBI and one of its affiliates, and a claim objection with respect to derivatives close-out claims acquired by the Firm in the Washington Mutual transaction.In January 2016, the parties reached an agreement, approved by the Bankruptcy Court, under which the Firm will pay $1.42 billion&#32;to settle all of the claims, counterclaims and claims objections, including all appeal rights, except for the claims specified in the following paragraph. One pro se&#32;objector sought to appeal the settlement, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed his appeal.The settlement did not resolve the following remaining matters: In the Bankruptcy Court proceedings, LBHI and the Committee filed an objection to the claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to clearing advances made to LBI, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for its claims in a commercially reasonable &nbsp;manner. In January 2015, LBHI brought two&#32;claims objections relating to securities lending claims and a group of other smaller claims. Discovery with respect to these objections is ongoing.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the DOJ, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), the Canadian Competition Bureau, the Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the BBA's London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Banking Federation (&#8220;EBF&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the EBF's Euro Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;) and to the Japanese Bankers' Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;TIBOR&#8221;), as well as processes for the setting of U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. As previously reported, the Firm has resolved EC inquiries relating to Yen LIBOR and Swiss Franc LIBOR. In May 2014, the EC issued a Statement of Objections outlining its case against the Firm (and others) as to EURIBOR, to which the Firm has filed a response and made oral representations. Other inquiries have been discontinued without any action against JPMorgan Chase, including by the FCA and the Canadian Competition Bureau.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various United States District Courts, in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and/or EURIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR or EURIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation.The U.S. dollar LIBOR-related putative class actions and most U.S. dollar LIBOR-related individual actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Court dismissed certain claims, including the antitrust claims, and permitted other claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law to proceed. Certain plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the antitrust claims, and the 143United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral argument on the appeal in November 2015.The Firm is one&#32;of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. Plaintiffs primarily assert claims under the federal antitrust laws and Commodities Exchange Act.Madoff Litigation. Various subsidiaries of the Firm, including J.P. Morgan Securities plc, had been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited, so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions sought to recover payments made by the funds to defendants totaling approximately $155 million. All of these actions have been dismissed.A putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., Madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested) in Madoff's Ponzi scheme and were not included in a prior class action settlement. These plaintiffs allege violations of the federal securities law, as well as other state and federal claims. A similar action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, although it was not styled as a class action, and included claims pursuant to Florida statutes. The Florida court granted the Firm's motion to dismiss the case in September 2015. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal, which is pending. In addition, the same plaintiffs have re-filed their dismissed state claims in Florida state court. The New Jersey court granted the transfer motion to the Southern District of New York, and the Firm has moved to dismiss the case pending in New York.Three&#32;shareholder derivative actions have also been filed in New York federal and state court against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former Board members, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm's relationship with Bernard Madoff and the alleged failure to maintain effective internal controls to detect fraudulent transactions. All three&#32;actions have been dismissed. The plaintiff in one action did not appeal, the dismissal has been affirmed on appeal in another action, and one appeal remains pending.Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. The Firm and affiliates (together, &#8220;JPMC&#8221;), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, &#8220;Bear Stearns&#8221;) and certain Washington Mutual affiliates (together, &#8220;Washington Mutual&#8221;) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;). These cases include actions by individual MBS purchasers and by trustees for MBS trusts. Following the settlements referred to below, there are currently pending and tolled investor claims involving MBS with an original principal balance of approximately $3.6 billion, of which $2.1 billion&#32;involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual as issuer and $1.5 billion&#32;involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual solely as underwriter. The Firm and certain of its &nbsp;current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm's MBS activities.Issuer Litigation &#8211; Individual Purchaser Actions. The Firm is defending individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings). The Firm has settled a number of these actions. Several actions remain pending in federal and state courts across the U.S. and are in various stages of litigation.Underwriter Actions. In actions against the Firm involving offerings where the Firm was solely an underwriter of other issuers' MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable in various situations, such as where the issuers are now defunct.Repurchase Litigation. The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees, securities administrators or master servicers of various MBS trusts on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys' fees and costs and other remedies. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, has filed such a suit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) in connection with a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one&#32;or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation.In addition, the Firm and a group of 21&#32;institutional MBS investors made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion&#32;and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to 330&#32;MBS trusts created between 2005 and 2008. The offer does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. The trustees (or separate and successor trustees) for this group of 330&#32;trusts have accepted the settlement for 319&#32;trusts in whole or in part and excluded from the settlement 16&#32;trusts in whole or in part. The trustees' acceptance is subject to a judicial approval proceeding initiated by the trustees and pending in New York state court. An investor in some of the trusts for which the settlement has been accepted has intervened in the judicial approval proceeding to challenge the trustees' allocation of the settlement to the trusts. The judicial approval hearing was held in January 2016, and the parties are awaiting a decision. Separately, in October 2015, JPMC reached agreements to resolve repurchase and servicing claims for four&#32;trusts among the 16&#32;that were previously excluded from the trustee settlement. In December 2015, the court approved the trustees' decision to accept these separate settlements. The trustees are 144seeking to obtain certain remaining approvals necessary to effectuate these settlements.Additional actions have been filed against third-party trustees that relate to loan repurchase and servicing claims involving trusts sponsored by JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.Derivative Actions. Shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm's MBS activities have been filed against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors, in New York state court and California federal court. The New York actions have been dismissed, and the California action remains pending.Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the DOJ's Criminal Division and two&#32;United States Attorney's Offices relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. The Firm has also received subpoenas and informal requests for information from state authorities concerning the issuance and underwriting of MBS-related matters. The Firm continues to respond to these MBS-related regulatory inquiries.In addition, the Firm continues to cooperate with investigations by the DOJ, including the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut, and by the SEC Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, all of which relate to, among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain secondary market trading in residential and commercial MBS.The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation.Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm's compliance with the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act in connection with its mortgage lending practices. In addition, three&#32;municipalities have commenced litigation against the Firm alleging violations of an unfair competition law or the Fair Housing Act. The municipalities seek, among other things, civil penalties for the unfair competition claim, and, for the Fair Housing Act claims, damages resulting from lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. One&#32;of the municipal actions has been stayed, a motion to dismiss has been granted in another action, and a stay in the remaining action has been lifted.In March 2015, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A entered into a settlement agreement with the Executive Office for United States Bankruptcy Trustees and the United States Trustee Program (collectively, the &#8220;Bankruptcy Trustee&#8221;) to resolve &nbsp;issues relating to mortgage payment change notices and escrow statements in bankruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Trustee continues to review certain issues relating to mortgage payment change notices. In January 2016, the OCC determined that, among other things, the mortgage payment change notices issues that were the subject of the settlement with the Bankruptcy Trustee violated the 2011 mortgage servicing-related consent order entered into by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC (as amended in 2013 and 2015), and assessed a $48 million&#32;civil money penalty. The OCC concurrently terminated that consent order.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the &#8220;County&#8221;) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion&#32;in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the &#8220;Plan of Adjustment&#8221;), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment's effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending. Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (&#8220;OEP&#8221;), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, &#8220;Petters&#8221;) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three&#32;Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two&#32;credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. The actions collectively seek recovery of approximately $450 million. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in the actions filed by the Petters bankruptcy trustees.Proprietary Products Investigations and Litigation.&#32;In December 2015, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. 145Morgan Securities LLC agreed to a settlement with the SEC, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. agreed to a settlement with the CFTC, regarding disclosures to clients concerning conflicts associated with the Firm's sale and use of proprietary products, such as J.P. Morgan mutual funds, in the Firm's wealth management businesses, and the U.S. Private Bank's disclosures concerning the use of hedge funds that pay placement agent fees to JPMorgan Chase broker-dealer affiliates. The Firm continues to cooperate with inquiries from other government authorities concerning disclosure of conflicts associated with the Firm's sale and use of proprietary products. A putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of financial advisory clients from 2007 to the present whose funds were invested in proprietary funds and who were charged investment management fees, was dismissed by the Court. Plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal is pending.Referral Hiring Practices Investigations.&#32;Various regulators, including the DOJ's Criminal Division as well as the SEC, are investigating, among other things, the Firm's compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with respect to the Firm's hiring practices related to candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials, and its engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with these investigations.Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual's failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC and amended to include JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a defendant, asserting an estimated $6 billion&#32;to $10 billion&#32;in damages based upon alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with mortgage securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. In June 2015, the court ruled in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on the question of whether the Firm or the FDIC bears responsibility for Washington Mutual Bank's repurchase obligations, holding that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. assumed only those liabilities that were reflected on Washington Mutual Bank's financial accounting records as of September 25, 2008, and only up to the amount of the book value reflected therein. The FDIC is appealing that ruling and the case has otherwise been stayed pending the outcome of that appeal.Certain holders of Washington Mutual Bank debt filed an action against JPMorgan Chase which alleged that by acquiring substantially all of the assets of Washington Mutual Bank from the FDIC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. caused Washington Mutual Bank to default on its bond obligations. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss this action and the District Court dismissed the case except as to the plaintiffs' claim that JPMorgan Chase tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs' bond contracts with &nbsp;Washington Mutual Bank prior to its closure. JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC moved to dismiss the remaining claim and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice.&#160;The plaintiffs have confirmed they will not seek an appeal.JPMorgan Chase has also filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC, in its corporate capacity as well as in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank, asserting multiple claims for indemnification under the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement between JPMorgan Chase and the FDIC relating to JPMorgan Chase's purchase of most of the assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank.Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (&#8220;Wendel&#8221;) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. In April 2015, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was notified that the authorities were formally investigating the role of its Paris branch in the transactions, including alleged criminal tax abuse. JPMorgan Chase is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. In addition, civil proceedings have been commenced against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. by a number of the managers. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.* * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management's best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm's legal expense was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and was $687 million&#32;for the three months ended March 31, 2015. There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. 146In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or impact related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period. 147Note 24&#32;&#8211; Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four&#32;major reportable business segments &#8211; Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase's business segments, see Business Segment Results on page 16, and pages 83-84, and Note 33 of JPMorgan Chase's 2015 Annual Report.Segment resultsThe accompanying tables provide a summary of the Firm's segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2016&#32;and 2015, on a managed basis. Total net revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each of the segments is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent &nbsp;(&#8220;FTE&#8221;) basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This non-GAAP financial measure allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. The line of business equity allocations are updated as refinements are implemented.&#160;Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration stand-alone peer comparisons, regulatory capital requirements (as estimated under Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In rules) and economic risk. The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity.148Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo&#32;the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of March 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and changes in cash flows for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm's management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.&nbsp;We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and changes in cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 23, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.April 29, 2016PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017149150<hr
