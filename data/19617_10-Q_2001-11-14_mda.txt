Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEWResults for all periods give effect to the merger of The Chase ManhattanCorporation and J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated on December&nbsp;31, 2000.Financial Results: Reported net income, which includes merger andrestructuring costs, was $449&nbsp;million, or $0.22 per share, in the thirdquarter of 2001. This compares with $378&nbsp;million, or $0.18 per share, inthe second quarter of 2001 and $1,398&nbsp;million, or $0.69 per share, in thethird quarter of 2000. For the first nine months of 2001, reported netincome was $2,026&nbsp;million, or $0.97 per share, compared with $5,019&nbsp;million,or $2.53 per share, in the same period last year.bp &#150; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.In addition to disclosing its results on a reported basis, JPMorgan Chasemanages its financial performance on an operating basis. As used byJPMorgan Chase, &#147;operating basis&#148; excludes the impact of creditcard securitizations, merger and restructuring costs, special items and thenet effect of changes in accounting principles. For a reconciliationbetween reported results and results on an operating basis, see page 29.-15- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)On an operating basis, JPMorgan Chase's diluted earnings per share for thethird quarter of 2001 were $0.51, compared with $0.33 in the second quarterof 2001 and $0.70 in the third quarter of 2000. Operating earnings were$1,036&nbsp;million in the 2001 third quarter, compared with $690&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2001 and $1,419&nbsp;million one year ago. For the first ninemonths of 2001, operating earnings were $3,162&nbsp;million, or $1.53 per share,as against $5,164&nbsp;million, or $2.60 per share, in last year's same period.Management also tracks the operating performance of JPMorgan Chase excludingthe results of JPMorgan Partners (&#147;JPMP&#148;). Management believes that thevaluation of JPMP should not be assessed simply by assigninga multiple to gains and losses recorded during a quarterly accountingperiod. Excluding the results of JPMorgan Partners, operating earnings were$1,196&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001, compared with $1,317&nbsp;million inthe second quarter of 2001 and $1,542&nbsp;million in the 2000 third quarter.Operating earnings excluding JPMP for the first nine months of 2001 were$3,972&nbsp;million, compared with $4,768&nbsp;million in the first nine months of2000.Over the past few years, volatile stock markets have produced significantfluctuations in the values of the securities held by JPMorgan Partners,resulting in unrealized and realized valuation adjustments for variousperiods that have significantly affected, both favorably and unfavorably,the Firm's operating results. The contribution of JPMP to operating earnings per share was a loss of $0.08in the third quarter of 2001, compared with a $0.31 loss in the secondquarter of 2001 and a loss of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2000. Excludingthe results of JPMP, operating earnings per share were $0.59 in the thirdquarter of 2001. This compares with $0.64 in the second quarter of 2001 and$0.77 in the third quarter of 2000.The impact of the amortization of intangibles was$0.09 per share in both thethird and second quarters of 2001 and$0.08 per share one year ago.For a reconciliation of diluted EPS from reported net income to cashoperating earnings excluding JPMP, see the table below.-16- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Highlights of Third Quarter 2001 Operating Results:(All periods in 2000 are on a pro forma basis, which assumes that thepurchase of Robert Fleming Holdings Limited (&#147;Flemings&#148;) had occurred atthe beginning of that year.) Highlights for the third quarter 2001 are asfollows:Nonperforming assets were $2.65&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2001, compared with$2.50&nbsp;billion and $1.94&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2001 and September&nbsp;30, 2000,respectively. Net charge-offs on a managed basis (i.e., treatingsecuritized credit card receivables as if continued to be owned bythe Firm)were $815&nbsp;million in the 2001 third quarter, an increase from $798&nbsp;millionin the second quarter of 2001 and $559&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000.Provisions in excess of charge-offs of $200&nbsp;million were recorded in thethird quarter of 2001, of which $140&nbsp;million related to the commercialportfolio and $60&nbsp;million related to the consumer portfolio. Management ofJPMorgan Chase believes nonperforming assets will continue to increase.Total assets as of September&nbsp;30, 2001 were $799&nbsp;billion, compared with $713billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2001 and $707&nbsp;billion one year ago. The increasepartly reflected the effect of clearing and settlement issues following theevents of September&nbsp;11th, which are expected to be temporary. During thethird quarter of 2001, the Firm purchased approximately 19&nbsp;million shares ofcommon stock pursuant to JPMorgan Chase's stock buy-back program. The costfor these repurchases, net of stock issuance, was approximately $500million. JPMorgan Chase's Tier One Capital ratio was 8.2% at September&nbsp;30,2001, 8.7% at June&nbsp;30, 2001 and 8.1% one year ago.JPMorgan Chase's third quarter 2001 special items included $876&nbsp;million(pre-tax) in merger and restructuring costs, including an additional $300million related to the right-sizing of employee levels beyond thatplanned at the time of the merger. Special items in the third quarter of2000 included an $81&nbsp;million gain from the sale of a business in Panama, a$35&nbsp;million loss resulting from the economic hedge of the purchase price ofFlemings prior to its acquisition and $79&nbsp;million in restructuring costs.General Outlook:Results for the quarter were overshadowed by the tragic events of September11th. In the days immediately following that tragedy, management'sattention was focused on the needs of the Firm's clients, employees andcommunity. The current climate continues to be challenging and isexpected to remain challenging for at least the remainder of the year. In thisenvironment, management's strategy is to continue to control the Firm's riskand level of expenses. Actions include accelerating the right-sizing ofmarket-sensitive businesses; setting profit margin targets for each line ofbusiness; focusing on distribution and diversification within the credit-relatedportfolios; and continuing capital discipline. These efforts are intendedto produce significant operating leverage once the markets return to morenormal activity levels.Merger Update:-17- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSThe table below provides summary financial information on a cash operatingbasis for the five major business segments. All periods below have beenrestated on a comparable basis to reflect the changes in capital allocationadopted in the first quarter of 2001; restatements may occur in futureperiods to reflect further alignment of management accounting policies orchanges in organizational structures between businesses. For a discussion ofeach business profile, see pages 28-36 of the JPMorgan Chase 2000 AnnualReport.NM &#150; Not meaningful.-18- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKThe following table sets forth selected financial data of the InvestmentBank.NM &#150; Not meaningful.(All comments related to 2000 give pro forma effect to the purchase ofFlemings, which is treated as if it had occurred at the beginning of thatyear.)The Investment Bank's operating revenues were $3.60&nbsp;billion in the thirdquarter of 2001, a decline of 4% from the second quarter and a decline of10% from the third quarter of 2000. Cash operating expenses of $2.18billion were down by 7% from the second quarter and by 15% from the thirdquarter of 2000. The decline in expenses was spread across all expensecategories and reflected merger synergies and expense managementinitiatives. By year-end, management expects to have eliminated approximately 6,000positions in the Investment Bank since the merger announcement date.These initiatives resulted in stable operating margins during 2001 despitedifficult market conditions, as the overhead ratio for the quarterwas 61%. The Investment Bank is targeting a cash overhead ratio of60% for the full-year 2001, assuming no further deterioration inmarket conditions.-19- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Trading revenues (including related net interest income (&#147;NII&#148;)) of $1.52billion declined by 6% from the second quarter and by 3% from the thirdquarter of 2000. Overall trading was only marginally lower, as fixed incomeand other trading activities generated higher revenues, compared with theprior periods, while equity trading was lower as a result of marketconditions. In addition, due to heightened market activity in September, theInvestment Bank realized a greater demand for its market-making servicesacross a broad range of products, including fixed income products such asdebt instruments and interest rate contracts.Investment banking fees totaled $807&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001,declining 12% from the second quarter and 24% from the third quarter of2000. High-grade bond underwriting continued to generate strong results,although results were lower than the record level in the second quarter.The continued weak equity market conditions resulted in lower equityunderwriting fees. Advisory revenues in the third quarter increased 9% fromthe second, but decreased 28% from the third quarter of 2000. During thefirst nine months of 2001, important product leadership positions weremaintained in leveraged and syndicated lending (No.1) and U.S. high-gradebonds (No.2). In addition, the Investment Bank increased its market shareof global announced M&A transactions to 21% for the first nine months of2001 from 18% in 2000 (derived from Thomson Financial Securities Data, basedon proceeds). Nevertheless, investment banking revenues for theremainder of the year will be largely dependent upon the level ofmarket activity for underwriting and M&A advisory work, which arecurrently expected to remain at the same weak levels as experiencedduring the first nine months of this year.Net interest income rose 11% and 28% from the second quarter of 2001 andlast year's third quarter, respectively. The increases were primarilyattributable to the favorable impact of the continuing decline in interestrates in 2001 as spreads on interest-earning assets were slightly wider thanin each of the two other prior periods, reflecting the fact that theinterest expense related to carrying the interest-earning assets declinedfaster than the interest income earned.Fees and commissions of $390&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001 declinedby 2% from the second quarter and by 12% from the third quarter of 2000. Ineach instance, the declines reflected lower equity brokerage commissions.All other revenue declined significantly from the second quarter of 2001 andthe third quarter of last year as a result of unfavorable valuationadjustments, primarily on loans that were syndicated or originated fordistribution but still are currently carried on the Consolidated BalanceSheet.The Investment Bank's cash operating earnings totaled $710&nbsp;million in thethird quarter, a 10% decline from the second quarter and a 19% reductionfrom the third quarter of 2000. Earnings declines also were affectednegatively by higher credit costs, including $140&nbsp;million in provisions inexcess of charge-offs.-20- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERSThe following table sets forth selected financial data of JPMorgan Partners.Due to the significant fluctuations in JPMP's operating results, priorperiods are shown in absolute dollars rather than percent changes from thecurrent period.JPMorgan Partners had private equity losses of $103&nbsp;million in the thirdquarter of 2001, compared with losses of $826&nbsp;million in the second quarterand losses of $20&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000. The unrealizedlosses were primarily related to mark-to-market losses taken on publicpositions during the quarter and included the positive impact of economichedging actions aimed at reducing the portfolio's sensitivity to marketmovements. Realized gains were attributable to investment returns from bothdirect and third-party fund investments, highlighted by strong returns fromJPMP's energy sector.-21- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOThe following table presents the carrying values and costs of the JPMPinvestment portfolio for the dates indicated.The book value of JPMP's investment portfoliowas $2.3&nbsp;billion lower onSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001 than on September&nbsp;30, 2000, reflecting write-downs andwrite-offs in the portfolio, particularly those taken in the second quarterof 2001 relating to JPMP's technology, media and telecommunicationsinvestments (&#147;TMT&#148;). At September&nbsp;30, 2001, TMT investmentsrepresented approximately 32% of the total carrying value of JPMP'sportfolio, unchanged from June 30, 2001. During theremainder of 2001 and in 2002, JPMP will continue to focus on increasing the industry and geographicdiversification of its portfolio. JPMP reviews investments in itsportfolio on an ongoing basis.During the first nine months of 2001, JPMP invested$0.6 billion of its own funds in direct equity. The following table presents information about the 10 largest holdings ofpublic securities in the JPMP investment portfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2001.The carrying values of the equity investmentsrecorded on JPMorgan Chase's financialstatements are net of interests of investors other than the Firm. JPMP has soldinterests in certain of its fund investments to persons notaffiliated with the Firm. In November 2001, JPMP completed its firstclosing, in the amount of approximately $825 million, on the sale to unaffiliated third partiesof interests in a new investment fund thatwill co-invest with JPMP in its direct investments. As a result,JPMorgan Chase's proportional ownership share ofinvestments to be made by JPMP in the future is expected to be reduced.However, the Firm continues to believe JPMP's equity-related investmentswill create long-term value for JPMorgan Chase. The Firmcurrently is prepared to commit at least $1.5&nbsp;billion of its own funds toJPMP in each of the next four years.-22- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGThe following table reflects selected financial data for InvestmentManagement & Private Banking (&#147;IMPB&#148;).(All comments related to 2000 give pro forma effect to the purchase ofFlemings, which is treated as if it had occurred at the beginning of thatyear.)IMPB had operating revenues of $733&nbsp;million inthe third quarter of 2001, an 8% decline from the secondquarter of 2001 and a 23% decline from the third quarter of 2000. For thefirst nine months of 2001, revenues decreased 20% from the same period ayear ago. The declines were mainly due to lower brokerage commissionsdriven by the reduction in clients' self-directed marketactivities at the Private Bank; lower netinterest income due to the adverse effects of declining interest rateson deposit spreads at the Private Bank; and lower investment fees as aresult of the lower values of funds under management as a result of theweaker market environment of 2001.IMPB's cash operating expenses declined 11% from last quarter and 19% fromthe third quarter of 2000. Cash operating expenses for the first ninemonths of 2001 declined 10% from the first nine months of 2000. Thedecreases were driven by expense management initiatives, in particular lowercompensation expense as a result of headcount reductions. Cash operatingearnings were $118&nbsp;million, down 29% from the third quarter of 2000. Forthe first nine months of 2001, cash operating earnings were $340&nbsp;million, a35% decline from 2000.-23- Table of ContentsPart 1Item 2 (continued)The table below reflects the assets under management in IMPB and assetsunder supervision in Private Banking as of September&nbsp;30, 2001 and 2000,respectively.Equity market conditions in 2001 led to a 10% decline in assets undermanagement at September&nbsp;30, 2001, compared with September&nbsp;30, 2000. Netcash flows for the 2001 third quarter were positive as a result of asignificant increase in clients' cash and money market assets. Thisexcludes assets managed by other lines of business and assets attributableto the Firm's 45% interest in American Century Companies, Inc. (&#147;AmericanCentury&#148;).-24- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESThe following table sets forth selected financial data of Treasury &Securities Services (&#147;T&SS&#148;).Treasury & Securities Services' operating revenues were $917&nbsp;million in thethird quarter of 2001, essentially flat with the second quarter of 2001 andan increase of 3% from the third quarter of 2000. Operating revenues forTreasury Services increased by 3% from the second quarter and by 7% from theprior year, reflecting higher cash management product revenues in the UnitedStates and Europe that offset the negative effect of declining short-terminterest rates on deposits. Institutional Trust revenues increased 12%,when compared with the third quarter of 2000, driven by stronger volumes indebt markets as well as the impact of acquisitions. Investor Services'operating revenues were virtually flat, when compared with the secondquarter of 2001 but declined 3% from the third quarter of 2000, reflectinglower fees based on asset values, lower foreign exchange revenue and lowerspreads on deposits.Operating expenses declined 3% from the second quarter of 2001 but increased6% from the third quarter of 2000. The combination of modest revenue growthand improved expense control resulted in a 9% improvement in cash operatingearnings from the second quarter. Cash operating earnings declined 1% fromthe third quarter of 2000. Cash ROCE was 25% in the third quarter of 2001and 24% year-to-date.Expense discipline will continue, and management ofT&SS continues to work towards its long-term target of a cash overhead ratio of approximately 65%.-25- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICESThe following table reflects selected financial data for Retail & MiddleMarket Financial Services (&#147;RMMFS&#148;).NM &#150; Not meaningful.RMMFS' operating revenues in the third quarter of 2001 were $2.78&nbsp;billion,increasing by 6% from the third quarter of 2000 and 4% from the 2001second quarter. The growth reflectedhigher production in home and auto financing, growth in managed credit cardoutstandings, and higher deposit volumes in retail and middle marketbanking. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower rateson deposit spreads, mortgage servicing prepayments and an overall marketdecline in investment volume. In addition, comparisons with the first ninemonths of 2000 benefited from the $100&nbsp;million charge for auto leaseresidual taken in the first quarter of 2000. The risk of future charges forresidual values was substantially mitigated in the first quarter of 2001through the purchase of a residual value insurance policy to coverpreviously uninsured auto leases in the portfolio.Cash expenses increased by 6% from the thirdquarter of last year and 2% from the second quarter of 2001,reflecting the higher production volumes in credit card and mortgageoriginations. Cash operating earnings of $439&nbsp;million for the third quarterof 2001 were down 15% from the record third quarter of 2000 as a result ofhigher net charge-offs, a $60&nbsp;million provision in excess of charge-offstaken in the third quarter of 2001, and the sale of the consumer banking operations in Hong Kong atthe end of 2000. In comparison to the second quarter of 2001, cashoperating earnings were down 3%. For the first nine months of 2001, however, cash operatingearnings were relatively flat from the first nine months of 2000.Management is cautious about consumer creditconditions and anticipates consumer credit quality may worsen overthe remainder of the year.-26- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within RMMFS.NM &#150; Not meaningful.Cardmember ServicesCardmember Services' operating revenues were up 17% for the third quarterand 13% for the first nine months of 2001, compared with the same periodslast year. The level of operating revenues in the third quarter of 2001represents the seventh consecutive quarterly increase for CardmemberServices. The higher revenues were driven by an increase in new accountsover the last several quarters, higher purchase volume and greater fee-basedrevenue. The increase in revenues for the third quarter and nine-month period was partlyoffset by higher credit costs. Inaddition, expenses rose as a result of higher business volumes. Cashoperating earnings were up 2% for the third quarter of 2001 and 9% for thefirst nine months of 2001, compared with the same periods in 2000. Creditcard related outstandings grew more than 14% from one year ago to more than$39&nbsp;billion.Regional Banking GroupRegional Banking Group's operating revenues for the third quarter of 2001and the first nine months of 2001 declined 7% and 3% from the respectiveperiods of 2000, and cash operating earnings for the third quarter of 2001and the first nine months of 2001 declined 16% and 6%, when compared withthe third quarter and first nine months of 2000, respectively. Theseresults reflected the adverse effects of declining interest rates on depositspreads and lower investment brokerage volume as a result of weaker marketconditions in 2001, partly offset by deposit growth of 4%.-27- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Home FinanceHome Finance's operating revenues and cash operating earnings rose 28% and20%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2001 versus the prior year'squarter and were up 20% and 23%, respectively, for the first nine months of2001 over the same period last year. The increases in the third quarter of2001 were due to a 132% growth in origination volume (as a result of lowerinterest rates during 2001), 21% growth in servicing balances and higher netinterest margin. Home Finance's revenues were reduced in the first ninemonths of 2001 by $279&nbsp;million due to impairments on MSRs and other assets,partially offset by gains on AFS securities and derivative instruments usedto economically hedge MSRs. This reduction in revenues resulted fromaccelerated prepayments from borrowers due to the decline in interest rates.Originations (residential, home equity and manufactured housing) for thethird quarter of 2001 were $47&nbsp;billion, and the Home Finance servicingportfolio exceeded $400&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2001.Middle MarketsMiddle Markets' operating revenues and cash operating earnings for the thirdquarter of 2001 declined 5% and 13%, respectively, from the third quarter of2000. Operating revenues decreased 2% compared with the first nine monthsof 2000, while cash operating earnings decreased 5% over that same timeperiod. The decrease in cash operating earnings in the third quarter of2001 reflected the negative impact of narrower spreads on deposits,partially offset by deposit growth of 6%.Auto FinanceAuto Finance's operating revenues and cash operating earnings were$379&nbsp;million and $88&nbsp;million, respectively, in the first nine months of2001. These results reflected a 65% increase in originations volumefor the first nine months of 2001, theimpact of lower interest rates, and the effect of a $100&nbsp;million charge recognized lastyear for the estimated decrease in auto lease residual value. In the thirdquarter of 2001, Auto Finance's market share increased to 4%from 2%during last year's same period.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's Support Units and Corporate include LabMorgan, Enterprise TechnologyServices, Corporate Business Services and the net effect of management accounting policies. For the third quarter of 2001,Support Units and Corporate had a cash operating loss of $78&nbsp;million,compared with a cash operating loss of $23&nbsp;million in the third quarter of2000.-28- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations on both a reported and operating basis. The table below providesa reconciliation between the Firm's reported and operating results.-29- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)REVENUESInvestment Banking FeesInvestment banking fees in the third quarter and first nine months of 2001declined significantly from last year's respective periods. Weak marketconditions in equity underwriting and merger and acquisition advisoryservices drove the decline in revenues. For a furtherdiscussion of JPMorgan Chase's investment banking fees, see the InvestmentBank line of business results on pages 19-20 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.Trading-Related RevenueTrading-related revenue (including associated NII) in the third quarter of2001 was relatively flat, when compared with the third quarter of 2000 butfor the first nine months of 2001 was down 6% from the first nine months of2000.-30- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Fees and CommissionsFees and commissions for the third quarter of 2001 declined 4%, whencompared with the third quarter of 2000. For the first nine months of 2001,fees and commissions were flat, when compared with the same period lastyear. The table below presents the significant components of fees andcommissions.Investment Management, Custody and Processing ServicesInvestment management fees were slightly lower than the third quarter of2000 but significantly higher in the first nine months of 2001 than the sameperiod last year. The decline from the third quarter of 2000 was driven bythe lower value of assets under investment management and lower transactionvolume; however, net cash flows for the 2001 third quarter were positive,compared with the prior quarter as a result of significant increases in cash and money market assets. The increase for the nine months of2001 when compared with last year was primarily attributable to the contributions ofFlemings, which increased the level of funds under management.Custody and processing services fees decreased slightly from the thirdquarter of 2000 but for the first nine months of 2001 were flat, whencompared with the first nine months of 2000. The decrease for the quarterwas largely due to the lower values of securities under custody and slowerinvestment flows overseas, partly offset by new business related toprocessing the issuance of debt instruments and servicing their interestpayments, coupled with higher cash management fees related to treasuryactivities.Credit Card RevenueThe increases of over 20% for both the third quarter and first nine monthsof 2001 reflected the impact of higher card fees, including higher interchange income as a result ofgreater customer purchase volume. Also contributing to the increaseswere higher late fees as a result of the rise in delinquencies.The following table reconciles JPMorgan Chase's reported credit card revenueand operating credit card revenue (which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations). The decline in revenue relating to securitizedcredit cards was due to the maturity of several securitizations.Brokerage and Investment ServicesBrokerage and investment services in the 2001 third quarter decreased $45million from the prior year's same quarter but rose $54&nbsp;million in the firstnine months of 2001 from the prior year. The decline in the third quarterof 2001 was partly due to the weaker markets that reduced the volume ofinstitutional and retail brokerage activities. The Flemings acquisitionsignificantly contributed to the increase in revenues for the first ninemonths of 2001.-31- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Mortgage Servicing FeesMortgage servicing fees in the third quarter and first nine months of 2001decreased $130&nbsp;million and $569&nbsp;million, respectively, from the same periods last year as a result of the net impairment of mortgage servicing rightsdue to the decline in mortgage interest rates. The impairment of therights was substantially offset by the favorable results of theirlinked SFAS&nbsp;133 derivatives and other economic hedges. Economichedge results are reflected in trading revenue and securities gains.While lower mortgage rates negatively affected mortgage servicingfees, they positively affected loan origination volume; higher loan origination volume increased netinterest income, as well as residential mortgage origination and sales activities,which are recognized in other revenue.Other Lending-Related Service FeesOther lending-related service fees were $18&nbsp;million lower than the thirdquarter of 2000 and $70&nbsp;million lower than the first nine months of lastyear. The declines were primarily attributable to the lower volume at, and therepositioning of, the trade finance business.Deposit Service ChargesDeposit service charges in the 2001 third quarter rose $41&nbsp;million from theprior year's quarter and, for the first nine months of 2001, increased $78million from the prior year. The increases reflected the impact of thelower interest rates as institutional customers at Treasury & SecuritiesServices who customarily would pay for deposit products and services bymaintaining a higher level of compensating balances instead reduced theirbalances and paid for the services through separate fees. Also contributingto the increase were new pricing schedules implemented for the depositproducts in the third quarter of 2001.Other FeesAll other fees rose $24&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001 from the sameperiod last year, partly as a result of the acquisition of Colson ServicesCorp. (&#147;Colson&#148;), a provider of record keeping, paying agent and otherfinancial services. Other fees for the first nine months of 2001 were $99million higher than the prior year, reflecting the growth in the volume ofannuity sales and the addition of Flemings and Colson.Private Equity GainsPrivate equity gains (losses)&nbsp;were significantly affected by the continuingdownturn in the equities market. Realized gains of $204&nbsp;million and $570million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2001, respectively,were offset by unrealized losses, which included mark-to-market losses onpublic securities. Unrealized losses also includes an unrealizedgain of approximately $65&nbsp;million on a NASDAQ-based hedge instrument thatwas entered into in mid-August. For a further discussion of JPMorganChase's private equity results, see the JPMP line of business results onpages 21-22 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.(a) Includes Private EquityGains (Losses) from JPMP and other business units.Securities GainsSecurities gains in the third quarter of 2001 were up 58% from last year'ssame quarter and, on a year-to-date basis, were up significantly from lastyear. These increases were principally the result of positioning theavailable-for-sale securities of the Firm in anticipation of a continuedreduction in interest rates in the United States and Europe. As aconsequence of the interest rate declines in the first nine months of 2001,the value of debt securities held this year rose and produced significantgains upon the sale of those securities.Home Finance utilized debt securities in addition to derivatives to hedge thevalue of the mortgage servicing rights it carries on the Balance Sheet. In the2001 first quarter, Home Finance realized $315&nbsp;million of gains from the sale ofdebt securities used as economic hedges of the mortgage servicing rights. Thesegains partially offset the decline in mortgage servicing fees as a result of theimpairment. In the 2001 second and third quarters, no material gains were recorded from thesale of securities.-32- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Other RevenueResidential mortgage activities (which include originations and sales ofloans and selective dispositions of mortgage servicing rights) in the thirdquarter and first nine months of 2001 rose as a result of the higher volumeof mortgage loans originated and sold in 2001. The decline in mortgageinterest rates and a strong housing market led to the growth of residentialloan originations and refinancings.All other revenue decreases were attributable to lower equity income fromthe American Century investment, reflecting the decline in the value of itsfunds under management; decline in hedge gains on planned overseas revenues;and unfavorable valuation adjustments, primarily on loans that weresyndicated or originated for distribution but still are carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheet.On a reported basis, results for the third quarter and nine months of 2000also included a gain of $81&nbsp;million on the sale of the Panama operationsoffset by losses of $35&nbsp;million and $176&nbsp;million, respectively, resultingfrom the economic hedge for the purchase price of Flemings prior to itsacquisition.Net Interest IncomeOperating NII adjusts reported NII for the impact of credit cardsecuritizations and trading-related NII that is considered part of totaltrading-related revenue. The following table reconciles reported andoperating NII.Net interest income in the third quarter and nine months of 2001 grew fromthe same periods last year, both on a reported and operating basis. Theprimary contributor to the increases was the continuing decline in interestrates in 2001, which led to growth in the level of interest-earning assets(in particular, consumer loans such as residential mortgages, credit cardreceivables and auto financings). The reduction in interest rates alsofavorably affected the spreads on interest-earning assets as the costrelated to carrying these assets declined faster than the interest incomeearned on them.In addition, both 2001 periods included the receipts of several interestrefunds on prior years' taxes aggregating $84&nbsp;million ($13&nbsp;million in thethird quarter).-33- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal operating noninterest expenses were $5.1&nbsp;billion in the third quarterof 2001, down 4% from the same period in 2000. On a pro forma basis,operating expenses for the first nine months of 2001 declined 6%from last year. JPMorgan Chase continues to target cash operatingexpenses for full year 2001 to be lower than pro forma cash operating expensesfor full year 2000. The declines in expenses primarilyreflected lower compensation expense as a result of headcount reductions,partly offset by investments in technology and communications facilities.The following table presents the components of noninterest expense on anoperating and reported basis.Compensation ExpenseCompensation expense declined 8% from the third quarter and 2% from thefirst nine months of 2000. The decreases were driven by headcountreductions, in particular in areas affected by the merger such as theInvestment Bank and Investment Management & Private Banking, as well as bylower incentive costs as a result of the decrease in revenues in theseareas. Partially offsetting the decline in the first nine months were theadditions of Flemings and the mortgage business of Advanta Corp. and theimpact of new hires at Home Finance and Cardmember Services to support thehigh production volumes.The Firm had 96,633 and 99,189 full-time equivalent employees at September30, 2001 and September&nbsp;30, 2000, respectively. The decline in full-timeequivalent employees was attributable to the elimination of positions in theInvestment Bank and Investment Management & Private Banking.Occupancy ExpenseOccupancy expense was relatively flat from lastyear's third quarter due to the savings derived from relocations of certain functionsfrom the New York metropolitan area to the South and Southwestregions of the United States, partially offset by leasing costs foradditional space requirements. The 8% increase in the first nine months of 2001 was primarilyattributable to the acquisition of Flemings, coupled with moderateinflationary increases across various occupancy expenses.Technology and CommunicationsThe increases from both the third quarter and first nine months of 2000mainly reflected the depreciation of hardware systems and amortization ofcapitalized software applications. In addition, the increases reflectedhigher telecommunications expenses, primarily associated with the increasein demand for market data, and higher leasing and maintenance costs forvarious telecommunications, computer and other office equipment.-34- Table of ContentsPart 1Item&nbsp;2 (continued)Other ExpenseOther expense declined 2% from the third quarter of 2000 and 1% from thefirst nine months of 2000. The following table presents the components ofother expense.Amortization of IntangiblesThe increases in amortization of intangibles over both periods in 2000 wereattributable to the acquisitions of Flemings and The Beacon Group, LLC inAugust and July of 2000, respectively.Merger and Restructuring CostsAs indicated in Note 4 on page 8 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q, management currentlyestimates that $650&nbsp;million of nonaccruable merger costs will be incurred in 2001and 2002. These nonaccruable merger costs will be in addition to the original total merger cost estimate of $3.2&nbsp;billion.Expense savings have also increased from the $2&nbsp;billion originally estimated atthe time of the merger to $3.2&nbsp;billion.Additionally, management currentlyestimates that the Firm will incur one-time pre-tax costs of $400&nbsp;million inconnection with the right-sizing of employee levels of certain businesses(2,000 employee reductions) beyond that planned at the time of the merger.Expense savings estimated to be realized from these right-sizing costs are$400&nbsp;million. These severance costs consist of a $300&nbsp;million charge that was recorded on September&nbsp;30, 2001 related to employees who werenotified that their positions had been eliminated and $100million of costs which are expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2001and in 2002 and which are not accruable under existing accounting pronouncements.Approximately 90% of the expense savings from the above merger and&#147;right-sizing&#148; costs currently are anticipated to be realized by the end of2002.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs on an operating basis are composed of the provision for loanlosses related to loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to the creditcosts associated with credit card receivables that have been securitized.The increases in the provision for loan losses were indicative of the moredifficult market environment and the higher volume of consumer loansoutstanding. Credit costs also included a $200&nbsp;million provision in excessof charge-offs in response to the current weaker credit environment forboth commercial and consumer loans. See page 41 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q for adiscussion of the allowance for credit losses.-35- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INCOME TAXESJPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of $220&nbsp;million in the thirdquarter of 2001, compared with $675&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2000.For the first nine months of 2001, JPMorgan Chase recorded income taxexpense of $1,083&nbsp;million, compared with $2,624&nbsp;million for the first ninemonths of 2000. The effective tax rates were 33% in the third quarter of2001 and 35% in the first nine months of 2001, compared with 33% and 34% inthe third quarter of 2000 and first nine months of 2000, respectively.RISK MANAGEMENTJPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholdervalue. The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market,operational and liquidity risk. For a discussion of these risks anddefinition of terms associated with managing these risks, please refer tothe Glossary of Terms on page 52 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q and pages 43-59 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of credit risk management and derivative andforeign exchange contracts used by JPMorgan Chase focuses primarily ondevelopments since December&nbsp;31, 2000 and should be read in conjunction withpages 46-53 and Notes 1 and 25 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 AnnualReport, in addition to Note 3 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.The following table presents the Firm's credit-related information for thedates indicated.-36- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's managed credit-related assets of $327&nbsp;billion at September30, 2001 increased 6%, when compared with year-end 2000. Commercial loansdecreased $2.9&nbsp;billion, or 2%, reflecting the Firm's ongoing discipline oforiginating loans for distribution and sale. Derivative and foreignexchange instruments increased by 12% from $76.4&nbsp;billion at year-end 2000.Consumer managed credit-related assets increased $11.0&nbsp;billion, or 10%, fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2000, largely in residential mortgages, auto financing andcredit cards.The portion of the commercial loan portfolio and counterparty creditoutstanding considered investment grade was 66% at September&nbsp;30, 2001,compared with 67% at year-end 2000. Management currently believes thatcredit conditions in the United States will remain challenging for theremainder of the year, which could have an adverse impact on credit qualityover time.The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily related to domesticcommercial and industrial credits. Given the credit conditions noted above,management expects a further increase in nonperforming assets in the fourthquarter of 2001. However, management believes that the Firm's creditperformance this year will continue to be better than the industry average.Net charge-offs in the managed portfolio were $815&nbsp;million and $2,301million in the third quarter and nine months of 2001, respectively, anincrease of $256&nbsp;million and $578&nbsp;million, respectively, from the sameperiods one year ago, primarily reflecting increased net charge-offs in thetelecommunications portion of the domestic commercial loan portfolio and inthe consumer credit card portfolio.Commercial Portfolio-37- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Portfolio (continued)Commercial and Industrial: The domestic commercial and industrial portfolioincreased $795&nbsp;million from 2000&nbsp;year-end. Domestic commercial andindustrial net charge-offs in the 2001 third quarter amounted to $132million, compared with $81&nbsp;million in the 2000 third quarter. Nonperformingdomestic commercial and industrial loans were $1.3&nbsp;billion, an increase of$608&nbsp;million from the 2000&nbsp;year-end. The foreign commercial and industrialportfolio totaled $35.2&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2001, a decrease of 5% fromthe 2000&nbsp;year-end level. Nonperforming foreign commercial and industrialloans were $530&nbsp;million, a decrease of $26&nbsp;million from year-end 2000,primarily as a result of a reduction in nonperforming commercial loans inAsia but partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in Latin America. Net charge-offs in the foreigncommercial and industrial loan portfolio for the third quarter of 2001increased to $63&nbsp;million from $4&nbsp;million in the same period last year.Financial Institutions: Loans to financial institutions decreased $1.3billion during 2001, when compared with year-end, as a result of reductionsin the foreign portion of the portfolio. Nonperforming financialinstitution loans were $44&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2001 and $42&nbsp;million atDecember&nbsp;31, 2000.Derivative and Foreign Exchange ContractsThe following table provides the remaining maturities of derivative andforeign exchange contracts outstanding at September&nbsp;30, 2001 and December31, 2000.-38- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Country ExposureThe following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selectedcountries. This disclosure is based on management's current view of countryexposure. The differences between the current presentation and that used atDecember&nbsp;31, 2000 and March&nbsp;31, 2001 are primarily as follows: (1)collateral held is used to reduce exposure on counterparty trades within acountry; and (2)&nbsp;disclosure is based on total exposure, which includes localexposure funded locally in addition to cross-border exposure. Managementbelieves the current presentation more accurately reflects JPMorgan Chase'scountry exposure. Amounts as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 have been restated toconform to the current presentation.Selected Country ExposureThe Firm has been closely managing its exposure to Argentina over theprior several quarters and, in particular, in the months leading up to the government's recent announcementof a restructuring of its bond obligations. Since June 30, 2001, theFirm has reduced its exposure to Argentina by $0.5 billion.-39- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Consumer PortfolioResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $55.2&nbsp;billionat September&nbsp;30, 2001, a $4.9&nbsp;billion increase, or 10%, from year-end. During thefirst nine months of 2001, the level of nonperforming residential mortgageloans increased 1%. The net charge-off rate of 0.10% for the third quarterof 2001 was four basis points higher than for the third quarter of 2000.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheetas well as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed credit card receivables of $38.0&nbsp;billion as of September&nbsp;30, 2001increased 4%, when compared with year-end 2000. During the 2001 thirdquarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card receivablesincreased to 5.64%, compared with 4.99% in the prior-year period. Loansover 90&nbsp;days past due remained stable at 1.95% of the portfolio at September30, 2001, compared with 1.96% at December&nbsp;31, 2000. Management anticipatesthat the managed credit card net charge-off ratio for full-year 2001 will behigher than the 5.12% for full-year 2000.-40- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased 23% at September&nbsp;30,2001, when compared with year-end 2000. The net charge-off rate of 0.53%for the 2001 third quarter was 12 basis points higher than the same period ayear ago. Total originations were $14.3&nbsp;billion for the nine months of2001, compared with $8.7&nbsp;billion for the same 2000 period.Other Consumer Loans: The level of other consumer loans of $7.8&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001 decreased 2% from year-end 2000. The net charge-offrates related to this portfolio were higher in the third quarter, whencompared with the third quarter of 2000 due to losses for certaindiscontinued businesses.Allowance for Credit LossesLoans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to coverprobable credit losses as of September&nbsp;30, 2001, for which either the assetis not specifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fullydetermined. Within the allowance, there are both specific and expected losscomponents and a residual component. The allowance for loan losses wasincreased by approximately $200&nbsp;million during the third quarter of 2001,reflecting the challenging credit conditions which resulted in an increasein the specific and expected loss components of the allowance. For afurther discussion of the specific loss, expected loss and residualcomponents of the allowance for loan losses, see page 53 of JPMorgan Chase's2000 Annual Report.The provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2001 increased $447million, or 150%, when compared with the third quarter of 2000.Foreign commercial loan net charge-offs increased $81&nbsp;million during thefirst nine months of 2001, when compared with the first nine months of 2000,while foreign commercial nonperforming loans decreased $164&nbsp;million fromSeptember&nbsp;30, 2000 to $580&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2001. However, domesticcommercial loan net charge-offs and nonperforming loans increased $227million and $767&nbsp;million, respectively, during the same periods.Lending-Related Commitments: JPMorgan Chase also has an allowance for itslending-related commitments, using a methodology similar to that used forthe loan portfolio. This allowance, which is reported in Other Liabilities,was $283&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2001 and December&nbsp;31, 2000 and was $304million at September&nbsp;30, 2000.-41- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTAggregate VAR ExposureValue-at-Risk (&#147;VAR&#148;) is a measure of the dollar amount of potential lossfrom adverse market moves in an everyday market environment. VARcalculations are performed for all material trading and investmentportfolios and for market risk-related asset/liability management (&#147;A/L&#148;)activities. Due to procedural differences at the heritage firms, combinedVAR is not available for periods prior to the merger date.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk,the tables that follow provide an overview of the market risk exposure ofJPMorgan Chase at the dates indicated. The following table representsJPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs for its trading portfolios andits A/L activities.Aggregate PortfolioMarket Risk-Related ActivitiesValue-at-Risk: JPMorgan Chase is exposed to interest rate, foreign exchange,equity and commodity market risks in its trading portfolio. The table belowreflects VAR data for the trading portfolio by risk category. See theAggregate VAR Exposure section above for average and period-end VARs for thetotal trading portfolio.Marked-to-Market Trading Portfolio (a)-42- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Histogram:The following histogram illustrates JPMorgan Chase's daily marketrisk-related revenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of themarked-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interestincome, brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue.In the first nine months of 2001, JPMorgan Chase posted positive dailymarket risk-related revenue for 166 out of 189 business days, with 134&nbsp;daysexceeding positive $20&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained on 23 of the 189&nbsp;daysrepresented in the histogram. JPMorgan Chase incurred five daily tradinglosses in excess of $20&nbsp;million in the first nine months of 2001.Stress Testing: Whereas VAR captures exposure to unlikely events in normalmarkets, stress testing discloses market risk under plausible events inabnormal markets.The following table represents the potential stress test loss (pre-tax) inJPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase's stress testscenarios.Largest Monthly Stress Test Loss &#150; Pre-Tax-43- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Investment Portfolio and Asset/Liability ActivitiesJPMorgan Chase is exposed to market risk in its investment portfolio and A/Lactivities. Market risk measurements for JPMorgan Chase's investmentportfolio and A/L activities reflect all significant market risk-relatedfactors that have an effect on these activities. Non-market factors thatare not included in market risk measurements, such as changes in creditquality, also may have an effect on these activities.Value-at-Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section on page 42 forJPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs for its investment portfolioand market risk-related A/L activities.Stress Testing:Economic value stress testing measures the potential change in the marketvalue of JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities. As ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001, the largest potential loss under the various economicvalue stress test scenarios utilized by the Firm on the value of JPMorganChase's investment portfolio and A/L activities would have been equivalentto 1% of JPMorgan Chase's market capitalization.The NII stress test measures the potential change in JPMorgan Chase'sinterest earnings over a one-year time horizon. At September&nbsp;30, 2001,JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NII stress test loss was estimated to beapproximately 1.3% of projected net income for the full-year 2001.Nonstatistical Risk Measures: Exposure to interest rate risk is assessedusing a Basis Point Value (&#147;BPV&#148;) method. BPV measures the change in marketvalue of JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities to a onebasis point increase in interest rates (directional risk) or one basis pointwidening of interest rate spreads (basis risk). The table that follows showsthat JPMorgan Chase had a directional BPV of $(1.5) million (pre-tax) atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001. This indicates that the market value of JPMorganChase's A/L positions would have declined by approximately $1.5&nbsp;million forevery one basis point increase in interest rates along the interest rateyield curve. The table also shows that the economic value of JPMorganChase's investment portfolio and A/L activities would have decreased by$11.0&nbsp;million (pre-tax) for every one basis point widening of interest ratespreads (basis risk).Market Risk-Related A/L Activities-44- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2000 and should be read inconjunction with pages 44-45 and Note 23 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 AnnualReport.CapitalJPMorgan Chase's capital levels at September&nbsp;30, 2001 continued to exceedregulatory guidelines. At September&nbsp;30, 2001, the Tier 1 and Total Capitalratios were 8.2% and 11.6%, respectively. In addition, at September&nbsp;30,2001, all of JPMorgan Chase's subsidiary depository institutions were&#147;well-capitalized&#148; under bank regulatory agencies' definitions. The Firm'sratios were negatively affected as a result of market disruptions followingthe events of September&nbsp;11th. Management estimates that the Firm experienced balance sheetgrowth of approximately $86&nbsp;billion and risk-weighted asset growth ofapproximately $21&nbsp;billion in the period between September&nbsp;11, 2001 andSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001.The following table shows JPMorgan Chase's capital generation and use duringthe periods indicated.In the first quarter of 2001, JPMorgan Chase raised the quarterly cashdividend on its common stock to $0.34 per share from $0.32 per share. TheFirm's current dividend policy is to pay over time common stock dividendsequal to approximately 25% to 35% of operating earnings less preferred stockdividends, although in any given quarter the common stock dividend may behigher or lower than this range. The current quarterly dividend exceeds thetarget range given this quarter's lower operating earnings. Future dividendpolicies will be determined by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors aftertaking into consideration the Firm's earnings, financial condition andapplicable governmental regulations and policies.On July&nbsp;19, 2001, JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors authorized therepurchase of up to $6&nbsp;billion of the Firm's common stock. As of September30, 2001, the Firm had repurchased, net of stock issuances, approximately$500&nbsp;million of the Firm's common stock.At September&nbsp;30, 2001, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (the sumof Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was $54.6&nbsp;billion, an increase of $1.2&nbsp;billionfrom December&nbsp;31, 2000. This increase reflects retained earnings (netincome less common and preferred dividends) generated during the period,aggregate common stock issuances and treasury stock reissuances of $1.2billion and the issuance of an aggregate $2.5&nbsp;billion in trust preferredcapital securities and subordinated debt. These sources of capital werepartially offset by the repurchase of common stock and theredemption of preferred stock and subordinated debt.LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk managementfocuses primarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2000 and should beread in conjunction with page 59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.LiquidityDuring the first nine months of 2001, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately$8.5&nbsp;billion of long-term debt and $500&nbsp;million of trust preferred capitalsecurities. During the same period, $9.8&nbsp;billion of long-term debt maturedor was redeemed, and $0.5&nbsp;billion of preferred stock was called.-45- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)As a result of the events of September&nbsp;11th, the Consolidated Balance Sheetincreased $86&nbsp;billion to $799&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2001 from $713billion at June&nbsp;30, 2001, primarily due to the securitiesindustry's temporary delay in clearing and settling cash and securities. The balance sheet growth is primarilycomposed of federal funds sold/purchased, trading assets and failed to deliver/receivesecurities (Other Assets/Other Liabilities). Management of JPMorgan Chaseexpects a reduction in balance sheet levels once the market returns to amore normal environment.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer topage 58 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervisionand Regulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Form10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries, without the approval of their relevantbanking regulators, could pay dividends to their respective bank holdingcompanies in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks byregulatory restrictions. These dividend limitations, in the aggregate,totaled approximately $4.8&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2001.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSLegal IsolationIn July 2001, the FASB issued a Technical Bulletin that would delay theeffective date of SFAS 140 for certain provisions that impact entitiessubject to possible receivership by the FDIC. For those entities, theTechnical Bulletin delays the isolation standards of SFAS 140 until at leastDecember&nbsp;31, 2001. The Firm currently is reviewing its transactions todetermine what modifications will be required to conform with SFAS 140 andthe Technical Bulletin.Business Combinations and Intangible AssetsIn June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 141, which revises the financialaccounting and reporting for business combinations, and also issued SFAS142, which revises the financial accounting and reporting for goodwill andother intangible assets. SFAS 141 requires that all business combinationsbe accounted for using the purchase method. Accounting for businesscombinations using the pooling of interests method no longer is allowed.SFAS 141 also requires that intangible assets acquired in a businesscombination be recognized apart from goodwill if the intangible assets meetone of two criteria &#151; the contractual-legal criterion or the separabilitycriterion. The provisions of SFAS 141 apply to all business combinationsinitiated after June&nbsp;30, 2001 as well as business combinations accounted forby the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July&nbsp;1, 2001 orlater. Certain transition provisions could affect the accounting forbusiness combinations using the purchase method that were completed beforeJuly&nbsp;1, 2001.SFAS 142 establishes how intangible assets (other than those acquired in abusiness combination) should be accounted for upon acquisition. It alsoaddresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted forsubsequent to their acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets that haveindefinite useful lives no longer will be amortized but will be tested atleast annually for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives willcontinue to be amortized over their useful lives. The provisions of SFAS142 are required to be adopted by the Firm beginning January&nbsp;1, 2002.Impairment losses that arise due to the initial application of SFAS 142 arerequired to be reported as a change in accounting principle.The Firm currently is assessing the impact of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 on itsfinancial condition and operating performance. The Firm has not yetdetermined the extent of goodwill impairment, if any, that may be recognizedupon the adoption of SFAS 142. Based on current levels of amortizationexpense, the Firm estimates that the elimination of goodwill amortizationexpense will reduce total noninterest expense by approximately $580&nbsp;millionduring 2002.-46- Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.
