Table of Contents98 Table of Contents99 Table of ContentsChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts for the three months endedMarch&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 (including changes in fair value), for financial instruments classified bythe Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When a determination is made to classify afinancial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of theunobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financialinstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observablecomponents (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part toobservable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk manages theobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positionsthat are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables donot reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3instruments.100 Table of Contents101 Table of Contents102 Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value ona nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but aresubject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there isevidence of impairment). The following tables present the assets and liabilities carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheets by caption and level within the valuation hierarchy as of March&nbsp;31,2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded duringthe reporting period.The methodused to estimate the fair value of impaired collateral-dependentloans depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, realestate, and nonfinancial assets). Fair value of the collateral isestimated based on quoted market prices, broker-quotes, independentappraisals or using a DCF model. For further information, see Note&nbsp;14, on pages 130-131 of this Form 10-Q.Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fairvalue adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three monthsended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, related to financial instruments held at those dates.103 Table of ContentsLevel 3 analysisLevel 3 assets at March&nbsp;31, 2010, principally include derivative receivables,mortgage servicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;), trading loans, andcollateralized loan obligations heldwithin the available-for-sale (&#147;AFS&#148;) securities portfolio. For further discussion of JPMorganChase's valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, see Note 3 onpages 148-165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Consolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 6% of totalFirm assets at March&nbsp;31, 2010. Level 3 assets were $121.9&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2010, reflecting adecrease of $8.5&nbsp;billion, due to the following significant changes during the quarter:Gains and LossesIncluded in the tables for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010Included in the tables for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009104 Table of ContentsCredit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuationadjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are notlimited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm's own creditworthiness. Themarket's view of the Firm's credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the creditdefault swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, seeNote 3 on pages 148-165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity,as reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respectiveperiods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments (including financialinstruments not carried at fair value)U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value ofcertain financial instruments, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate theirfair value. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included inthe following table. Additionally, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instrumentsare excluded from the scope. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures required provide only apartial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, the Firm has developed long-termrelationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonlyreferred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In the opinion ofmanagement, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fairvalue is not disclosed in this Note.Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair valueCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheetsare carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generallynegligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks; deposits with banks,federal funds sold; securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed withshort-dated maturities; short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable; commercial paper;federal funds purchased; securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements with short-datedmaturities; other borrowed funds (excluding advances from Federal Home Loan Banks); accountspayable; and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value for depositliabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) beequal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments isnot permitted.105 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial assets andliabilities.106 Table of ContentsThe majority of the Firm's unfunded lending-related commitments are not carried at fair valueon a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carryingvalue and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending-related commitments were as followsfor the periods indicated.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In manycases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower prior notice or,in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. For a further discussion of the valuation oflending-related commitments, see Note 3 on pages 149&#151;150 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Trading assets and liabilities average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.107 Table of ContentsNOTE 4 &#151; FAIR VALUE OPTION For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which fair value elections have beenmade, including the determination of instrument-specific credit risk for these items and the basisfor those elections, see Note 4 on pages 165-167 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements ofIncome for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, for items for which the fair valueelection was made. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financialinstruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments,which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.108 Table of ContentsDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balanceoutstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregateremaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009,for loans and long-term debt for which the fair value option has been elected.109 Table of ContentsNOTE 5 &#151; DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS For a further discussion of the Firm's use and accounting policies regarding derivativeinstruments, see Note 5 on pages 167-175 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of March31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm'sderivative activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possiblelosses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notionalamount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.110 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative fair values that are reflected on theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, by accountingdesignation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.Free-standing derivatives(a)Derivative receivables and payables mark-to-marketThe following table summarizes the fair values of derivative receivables and payables, includingthose designated as hedges by contract type after netting adjustments as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009.111 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives and hedged items on the income statement and on other comprehensiveincomeThe following table summarizes the total pretax impact of JPMorgan Chase's derivative-relatedactivities on the Firm's Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income for thethree months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, by accounting designation.The tables that follow reflect more detailed information regarding the derivative-relatedincome statement impact by accounting designation for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, and2009, respectively.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedgeaccounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and therelated hedged items for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Firmincludes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line itemin the Consolidated Statements of Income.112 Table of ContentsCash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedgeaccounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the threemonths ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on thehedging derivative in the same line item as the offsetting change in cash flows on the hedged itemin the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, the Firm expects that $245&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin AOCI at March&nbsp;31, 2010, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximumlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and such transactionsprimarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.113 Table of ContentsNet investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in netinvestment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on suchderivatives for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Risk management derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedging instruments)The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated inhedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the threemonths ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These derivatives are risk managementinstruments used to mitigate or transform the risk of market exposures arising from bankingactivities other than trading activities, which are discussed separately below.Trading derivative gains and lossesThe Firm has elected to present derivative gains and losses related to its trading activitiestogether with the cash instruments with which they are risk managed. All amounts are recorded inprincipal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months endedMarch&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresDerivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typicallyrequire the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the mark-to-marketmoves in the counterparties' favor, or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's or its subsidiaries'respective credit ratings. At March&nbsp;31, 2010, the impact of a single-notch and six-notch ratingsdowngrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., wouldhave required $1.4&nbsp;billion and $4.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, of additional collateral to be posted bythe Firm. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upona downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts.At March&nbsp;31, 2010, the impact of single-notch and six-notch ratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase &Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., related to contracts withtermination triggers would have required the Firm to settle trades with a fair value of $285million and114 Table of Contents$5.9&nbsp;billion, respectively. The aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that containcontingent collateral or termination features triggered upon a downgrade was $28.1&nbsp;billion at March31, 2010, for which the Firm has posted collateral of $25.1&nbsp;billion in the normal course ofbusiness.The following table shows the current credit risk of derivative receivables after nettingadjustments and collateral received, and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables afternetting adjustments and collateral posted, as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009,respectively.In addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above, at March&nbsp;31, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm had received liquid securities collateral in the amount of $14.4billion and $15.5&nbsp;billion, respectively, and posted $13.5&nbsp;billion and $11.7&nbsp;billion, respectively.The Firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions, whichis available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of thetransactions move in the Firm's or client's favor, respectively. Furthermore, the Firm and itscounterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency forcollateral to be posted, and collateral that the Firm or a counterparty has agreed to return buthas not yet settled as of the reporting date. At March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firmhad received $21.1&nbsp;billion and $16.9&nbsp;billion, respectively, and delivered $6.6&nbsp;billion and $5.8billion, respectively, of such additional collateral. These amounts were not netted against thederivative receivables and payables in the table above, because, at an individual counterpartylevel, the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at both March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31,2009.Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including adescription of the different types used by the Firm, see Note&nbsp;5on pages 167-175, of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table presents a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009. Upona credit event, the Firm as seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of thefull notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on thecontracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time ofsettlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasingprotection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. As such, other purchasedprotection referenced in the following table includes credit derivatives bought on related, but notidentical, reference positions; these include indices, portfolio coverage and other referencepoints. The Firm does not use notional amounts as the primary measure of risk management for creditderivatives, because notional does not take into account the probability of occurrence of a creditevent, recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges.115 Table of ContentsTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following table summarizes the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, where JPMorgan Chase is theseller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of thecredit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity onwhich the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of protectionpurchased are comparable to the profile reflected below.Protection sold &#151; credit derivatives and credit-related notesratings(a)/maturity profile116 Table of ContentsNOTE 6 &#151; OTHER NONINTEREST REVENUE For a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's other noninterestrevenue, see Note 6 on pages 175-176 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.The following table presents principal transactions revenue.The following table presents components of asset management, administration and commissions.117 Table of ContentsNOTE 7 &#151; INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.NOTE 8 &#151; PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#147;OPEB&#148;)plans, see Note 8 on pages 176-183 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit cost reported in theConsolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEBplans.118 Table of ContentsThe fairvalue of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEBplans and for thematerial non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $11.6&nbsp;billion and $2.4&nbsp;billion, respectively,as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and $11.5&nbsp;billion and $2.4&nbsp;billion, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009.See Note 20 on page 147 of this Form 10-Q for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e.,net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,2010 and 2009.The amount of 2010 potential contributions for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, ifany, are not reasonably estimable at this time. The 2010 potential contributions for the Firm'sU.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans are estimated to be $42&nbsp;million and for the non-U.S. definedbenefit pension and OPEB plans are estimated to be $171&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million, respectively.NOTE 9 &#151; EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES For a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-basedincentives, see Note 9 on pages 184-186 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The Firm recognized noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-basedincentive plans of $941&nbsp;million and $788&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and2009, respectively, in its Consolidated Statements of Income. These amounts included expense of$688&nbsp;million and $648&nbsp;million, respectively, related to the cost of prior grants of restrictedstock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) and stock appreciation rights (&#147;SARs&#148;) that are amortized over theirapplicable vesting periods, and expense of $253&nbsp;million and $140&nbsp;million, respectively, related tothe accrual of estimated costs of RSUs and SARs to be granted in future periods to full-careereligible employees.In the first quarter of 2010, the Firm granted 71&nbsp;million RSUs, with a weighted average grant datefair value of $43.12 per RSU, in connection with its annual incentive grant.NOTE 10 &#151; NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table presents the components of noninterest expense.119 Table of ContentsNOTE 11 &#151; SECURITIES Securities are classified as AFS, held-to-maturity (&#147;HTM&#148;) or trading. For additional informationregarding AFS and HTM securities, see Note 11 on pages 187-191 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 AnnualReport. Trading securities are discussed in Note 3 on pages 96-107 ofthis Form 10-Q.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and credit losses that were recognized inincome from AFS securities.&nbsp;The amortized costs and estimated fair values of AFS and HTM securities were as follows forthe dates indicated.&nbsp;120 Table of ContentsSecurities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for AFS securities by agingcategory at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.121 Table of ContentsOther-than-temporary impairmentThe following table presents credit losses that are included in the securities gains and lossestable above.&nbsp;Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, of the creditloss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income, related to debt securities thatthe Firm does not intend to sell. There were no OTTI losses related to debt securities that theFirm did not intend to sell for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2009.Unrealized losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, due primarily to market spreadimprovement and increased liquidity, driving asset prices higher. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, theFirm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely thatthe Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognizedin income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are notother-than-temporarily impaired as of March&nbsp;31, 2010.Following is a description of the Firm's main security investments with the most significantunrealized losses as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and the key assumptions used in its estimate of the presentvalue of the cash flows most likely to be collected from these investments.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; U.S. government agenciesAs of March&nbsp;31, 2010, gross unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities related to U.S.agencies were $300&nbsp;million, of which $48&nbsp;million related to securities that have been in anunrealized loss position for longer than 12&nbsp;months. These mortgage-backed securities do not haveany credit losses, given the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. federalgovernment.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; Prime and Alt-A nonagencyAs of March&nbsp;31, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residentialmortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers were $665&nbsp;million, of which $644&nbsp;millionrelated to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than 12&nbsp;months.Overall losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, due to increased market stabilization,resulting from increased demand for higher-yielding asset classes and U.S. government programs.Approximately one-fifth of these positions (by amortized cost) are currently rated &#147;AAA.&#148; Theremaining four-fifths have experienced downgrades since purchase, and approximately half of thepositions are currently rated below investment-grade. In analyzing prime and Alt-A residentialmortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses, the Firm utilizes a methodology thatfocuses on loan-level detail to estimate future cash flows, which are then applied to the varioustranches of issued securities based on their respective contractual provisions of thesecuritization trust. The loan-level analysis considers prepayment, home price, default rate andloss severity assumptions. Given this level of granularity, the underlying assumptions varysignificantly taking into consideration such factors as the financial condition of the borrower,loan to value ratio, loan type and geographical location of122 Table of Contentsthe underlying property. The weighted average underlying default rate on the positions was 20% andthe related weighted average loss severity was 49%. Based on this analysis, the Firm has recognized$6&nbsp;million of OTTI losses in earnings during the first quarter of 2010, related to securities thathave experienced increased delinquency rates associated with specific collateral types andorigination dates. The unrealized loss of $665&nbsp;million on the remaining securities is consideredtemporary, based on management's assessment that the credit enhancement levels for those securitiesremain sufficient to support the Firm's investment.Asset-backed securities &#151; Collateralized loan obligationsAs of March&nbsp;31, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to collateralized loanobligations were $353&nbsp;million, all of which related to securities that were in an unrealized lossposition for longer than 12&nbsp;months. Overall losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2009, mainlyas a result of lower default forecasts and spread tightening across various asset classes.Substantially all of these securities are rated &#147;AAA&#148;, &#147;AA&#148; and &#147;A&#148; and have an average creditenhancement of 29%. Credit enhancement in CLOs is primarily in the form of overcollateralization,which is the excess of the par amount of collateral over the par amount of securities. The keyassumptions considered in analyzing potential credit losses were underlying loan and debt securitydefaults and loss severity. Based on current default trends, the Firm assumed collateral defaultrates of 5% for the first quarter 2010 and thereafter. Further, loss severities were assumed to be50% for loans and 80% for debt securities. Losses on collateral were estimated to occurapproximately 24&nbsp;months after default.123 Table of ContentsContractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March&nbsp;31, 2010, ofJPMorgan Chase's AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.&nbsp;124 Table of ContentsNOTE 12 &#151; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 12 onpage 192 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. For further information regarding securitiesborrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, seeNote 4 on pages 108&#151;109 of this Form 10-Q.The following table details the Firm's repurchase agreements, resale agreements, securitiesborrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions, all of which are accounted for ascollateralized financings during the periods presented.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amounts reported in the table above have been reduced by $130.8&nbsp;billion and $121.2&nbsp;billionat March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively, as a result of the agreements having metthe specified conditions for net presentation under applicable accounting guidance.JPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchase agreementsand other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by the securedparty are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.At March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm received securities as collateral that could be repledged, delivered orotherwise used with a fair value of approximately $663.0&nbsp;billion. This collateral was generallyobtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements and customer margin loans. Ofthese securities, approximately $419.6&nbsp;billion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used,generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to covershort sales.NOTE 13 &#151; LOANS The accounting for a loan may differ based on whether it is originated or purchased and whether theloan is used in an investing or trading strategy. The measurement framework for loans in theConsolidated Financial Statements is one of the following:For a detailed discussion of the accounting policies relating to loans, see Note 13 on pages192&#151;196 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 108-109 of this Form 10-Q forfurther information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option.See Note 3 on pages 96-107 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair valueand classified as trading assets.125 Table of ContentsThe composition of the Firm's aggregate loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was asfollows.&nbsp;126 Table of ContentsThe following table reflects information about the Firm's loan sales.&nbsp;Impaired loansFor further discussion of impaired loans, including the nature of such loans and the relatedaccounting policies, and certain troubled debt restructurings, see Note 13 on pages 192-196 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The tables below set forth information about the Firm's impaired loans, excluding both purchasedcredit-impaired loans and modified credit card loans, which are discussed separately below.&nbsp;Loan modificationsCertain loan modifications are made in conjunction with the Firm's loss mitigation activities.Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who isexperiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm's economic loss, avoid foreclosureor repossession of the collateral and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from theborrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and mayinclude interest rate reductions, payment deferrals, or the acceptance of equity or other assets inlieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as troubled debtrestructurings.A loan that has been modified in a troubled debt restructuring is generally considered to beimpaired until its maturity, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms.In certain limited cases, the concession granted relates solely to principal adjustments or othernon-interest rate concessions, and the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan isat or above the current market rate at that time. In such circumstances, the loan is disclosed asimpaired and as a troubled debt restructuring only during the year of the modification; insubsequent years, the loan is not disclosed as impaired or as a troubled debt restructuring ifrepayment of the restructured loan on its modified terms is reasonably assured.It is the Firm's general policy to place loans, other than credit card loans, on nonperformingstatus when the loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring. In most cases, residential realestate and commercial loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring were considered nonperformingprior to their modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (resuming theaccrual of interest) if the criteria set forth in the Firm's accounting policy are met. Thesecriteria generally include (a)&nbsp;performance under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or six payments, and (b)&nbsp;an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonablyassured based on, for example, the borrower's debt capacity and level of future earnings,collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. The Firm's policy exemptscredit card loans, including modified credit card loans, from being placed on nonperforming statusas permitted by regulatory guidance. However, the Firm has separately established an allowance forthe portion of earned interest and fees that it estimates to be uncollectible.The allowance for loan losses for loans modified in troubled debt restructurings is determinedbased upon the same methodology used to estimate the Firm's asset-specific allowance component foras long as the loan continues to be reported as an impaired loan, regardless of whether the loanhas returned to performing status. For further discussion of the methodology used to estimate theFirm's asset-specific allowance, see Note 14 on pages 196-198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 AnnualReport.127 Table of ContentsWholesaleAs of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, wholesale loans modified in troubled debtrestructurings were $800&nbsp;million and $1.1&nbsp;billion, respectively. These modifications generallyprovided interest rate concessions to the borrower or deferral of principal repayments. Of theseloans, $210&nbsp;million and $491&nbsp;million were classified as nonperforming at March&nbsp;31, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.ConsumerFor detailed discussions on the U.S. Treasury Making Home Affordable (&#147;MHA&#148;) programs and theFirm's other loss-mitigation programs, see Note 13, Impaired loans, on pages 194-195 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. Substantially all of the modifications made under theseprograms are accounted for and reported as troubled debt restructurings.Consumer loans, other than credit card loans, with balances of approximately $3.9&nbsp;billion and $3.1billion have been permanently modified and accounted for as troubleddebt restructurings as of March31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively. Of these loans, $1.4&nbsp;billion and $966&nbsp;million wereclassified as nonperforming at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.Credit CardFor a detailed discussion of the modification of the terms of credit card loan agreements, see Note13 on pages 192&#151;196 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. Substantially all modifications ofcredit card loans performed under the Firm's existing modification programs are considered to betroubled debt restructurings. At March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm had $9.3&nbsp;billionand $5.1&nbsp;billion, respectively, of on-balance sheet credit card loans outstanding for borrowers whoare experiencing financial difficulty and who were then enrolled in a credit card modificationprogram. The increase in modified credit card loans outstanding from December&nbsp;31, 2009 to March&nbsp;31,2010, is primarily attributable to previously-modified loans held in Firm-sponsored credit cardsecuritization trusts being consolidated on balance sheet as a result of adopting the newconsolidation guidance. These modified loan amounts exclude loans to borrowers who have notcomplied with the modified payment terms, thereby causing the loan agreement to revert back to itsoriginal payment terms. Assuming that those borrowers do not begin to perform in accordance withthe original payment terms, those loans will continue to age and will ultimately be charged-off inaccordance with the Firm's accounting policies.Consistent with the Firm's policy, modified credit card loans remain on performing status.The consumer formula-based allowance for loan losses includes $4.0&nbsp;billion and $2.2&nbsp;billion atMarch&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, specifically attributable to credit card loans in loanmodification programs. This component of the allowance for loan losses has been determined basedupon the present value of cash flows expected to be received over the estimated lives of theunderlying loans.128 Table of ContentsPurchased credit-impaired loansIn connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans that itdeemed to be credit-impaired. For a detailed discussion of purchased credit-impaired loans,including the related accounting policies, see Note 13 on pages 192-196 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for purchased credit-impaired consumerloans for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.&nbsp;Thefactors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected,and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i)&nbsp;changes in the benchmark interest rateindices upon which customer rates are based for products such asoption ARM and home equity loans;and (ii)&nbsp;changes in prepayment assumptions.To date, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decreasein interest rates on variable rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extended loan liquidationperiods. Certain events, such as extended loan liquidation periods, affect the timing of expectedcash flows but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e.,the accretable yield balance). Extended loan liquidation periodsreduce the accretable yield percentage because the same accretableyield balance is recognized against a higher than expected loanbalance over a longer than expected period of time.The purchased credit-impaired portfolio primarily impactsthe Firm's results of operations through: (i)&nbsp;contribution to net interest margin; and (ii)&nbsp;expenserelated to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation ofthe loans, and (iii)&nbsp;any provision for loan losses. The purchased credit-impaired loans acquired in the WashingtonMutual transaction were funded based upon the interest rate characteristics of the loans. Forexample, variable-rate loans were funded with variable-rate liabilities and fixed-rate loans werefunded with fixed-rate liabilities with a similar maturity profile. As a result, the net spreadbetween the purchased credit-impaired loans and the related liabilities should be relativelyconstant over time, except for any basis risk or other residual interest rate risk that remains andchanges in the accretable yield percentage (e.g., extended loan liquidation periods). The netspread will be earned on a declining loan balance over the estimated weighted-average life of theportfolio, which is 6.6&nbsp;years as of March&nbsp;31, 2010.While the Firm has modified certain purchased credit-impaired loans, such modifications have notyet seasoned and the ongoing performance of these loans is difficult to predict. Accordingly, theFirm has not yet incorporated the potential positive cash flow effects of these modifications intoits expected cash flow estimates. The Firm will continue to monitor the success of themodifications and its ability to reliably estimate any related cash flow benefits. If themodifications ultimately result in a probable and significant increase in expected cash flows, theFirm will first consider the reversal of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses. Any remaining increasewill be recognized prospectively as interest income (through an increase in accretable yield).During the first quarter of 2010, $676&nbsp;million and $554&nbsp;million was added to the allowance for loanlosses for the prime mortgage and option ARM pools, respectively. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009, an allowance for loan losses of $2.8&nbsp;billion and $1.6&nbsp;billion, respectively, wasrecorded for the prime mortgage and option ARM pools. The net aggregate carrying amount of thepools that have an allowance for loan losses was $44.7&nbsp;billion and $47.2&nbsp;billion, respectively, atMarch&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009. This allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction ofthe carrying amount of the loans in the table below.The table below provides additional information about these purchased credit-impaired consumerloans.&nbsp;129 Table of ContentsNOTE 14 &#151; ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES For further discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, seeNote 14 on pages 196-198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses.&nbsp;The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for lending-related commitments.&nbsp;Charge-offs for Collateral-dependent loansIncluded in gross charge-offs in the table above are $244&nbsp;million and $65&nbsp;million of charge-offsrelated to impaired collateral-dependent loans for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,respectively. The remaining balance of impaired collateral-dependent loans, measured at fair valueof collateral less costs to sell, was $2.1&nbsp;billion and $1.1&nbsp;billion as of March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009,respectively.A loan is collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by theunderlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the borrower's operations, income or otherresources. A collateral-dependent loan is deemed to be impaired when the borrower is unable torepay the loan and the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest. Certain impairedcollateral-dependent loans (including those to wholesale customers and those modified in troubleddebt restructurings) are charged-off to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.The determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g.,securities, real estate, and nonfinancial assets). In cases where the collateral is in the form ofliquid securities, the fair value is based on130 Table of Contents quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquidsecurities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is estimated using adiscounted cash flow model.For residential real estate loans, collateral value is determined using both internal and externalvaluation sources. Broker opinions of fair value are used to estimate the fair value of thecollateral for all properties being evaluated for charge-off. These estimated fair values arereviewed and compared to prior valuations for reasonableness in light of current,geography-specific economic conditions and adjusted, as appropriate, for estimated selling costs.When foreclosure is determined to be probable, a third-party appraisal is obtained as soon aspracticable.For commercial real-estate loans, the collateral value is generally based on appraisals frominternal and external valuation services. Appraisals are typically obtained and updated every sixto twelve months. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which mayresult in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.See Note 3 on page 103 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the fair value hierarchy forimpaired collateral-dependent loans.NOTE 15 &#151; VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES For afurther description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities(&#147;VIEs&#148;), see Note 1 on pages 94-95 of this Form 10-Q. Fora more detailed discussion of the Firm's principal involvementwith VIEs, see Note 16 on page 206 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.The following summarizes the most significant type of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment:The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by thirdparties as described on page 138 of this Note.131 Table of ContentsNew Consolidation Accounting Guidance for VIEsOn January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm implemented new consolidation accounting guidance related to VIEs. Thefollowing table summarizes the incremental impact at adoption:&nbsp;Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsEffective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Firm-sponsoredcredit card securitization trusts and consolidated the assets and liabilities of these trusts,including its primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. The primary beneficiarydetermination was based on the Firm's ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through itsservicing responsibilities and duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that gettransferred into those trusts as well as any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, thenature and extent of the Firm's other involvement with the trusts including the retention of anundivided seller's interest in the receivables, retaining certain securities and the maintenance ofescrow accounts, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receivecertain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. For a more detaileddescription of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with credit card securitizations, as well asthe accounting treatment applicable under prior accounting rules, see Note 15 on pages 198-205 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Upon consolidation at January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm recorded a net increase in GAAP assets of $60.9billion on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which comprised: $84.7&nbsp;billion of loans; $7.4&nbsp;billion ofallowance for loan losses; $4.4&nbsp;billion of other assets, offset by $20.8&nbsp;billion of previouslyrecognized assets, consisting primarily of retained AFS securities, that were eliminated uponconsolidation. In addition, the Firm recognized $65.4&nbsp;billion of liabilities representing thetrusts' beneficial interests issued to third parties.132 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities of the Firm-sponsored credit cardsecuritization trusts at March&nbsp;31, 2010:The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets are available only forpayment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available topay the Firm's other obligations or the claims of the Firm's other creditors.The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimumundivided interest in the credit card trusts (which generally ranges from 4% to 12%). Theseundivided interests represent the Firm's undivided interests in the receivables transferred to thecredit card trusts that have not been securitized. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm held undividedinterests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $13.7&nbsp;billion. The Firm maintainedan average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those trusts of approximately 18%for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010. The Firm also retained $1.7&nbsp;billion of senior securitiesand $7.6&nbsp;billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts asof March&nbsp;31, 2010. As of January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm'sundivided interests in the credit card trustsand securities retained were eliminated in consolidation. The credit card receivables of thetrusts underlying the Firm's undivided interests and securities retained are classified withinloans.Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsEffective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain mortgagesecuritization trusts and the Firm-sponsored automobile and student loan trusts because the Firmhas the power to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities andduties, including making decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. Additionally, thenature and extent of the Firm's continuing economic involvement with the trusts obligates the Firmto absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive benefits from the VIEs which couldpotentially be significant. For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principalinvolvement with mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatmentapplicable under prior accounting rules, see Note 15 on pages 198-205 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009Annual Report.The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in JPMorganChase-sponsored securitization entities at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, including thosethat are consolidated by the Firm and those that are not consolidated by the Firm but for which theFirm has continuing involvement. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holdingsenior interests or subordinated interests, recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivativetransactions. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans.In the table below, the amount of beneficial interests held by JPMorgan Chase will not equal theassets held in nonconsolidated VIEs, because the beneficial interests held by third parties arereflected at their current outstanding par amounts, and a portion of the Firm's retained interests(trading assets and AFS securities) are reflected at their fair values. See Securitization activityon page 140 of this Note for further information regarding the Firm's cash flows with and interestsretained in nonconsolidated VIEs.133 Table of ContentsFirm-sponsored mortgage and other consumer securitization trusts.&nbsp;ResidentialmortgageThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by RFS, as well as residential mortgageloans that may be purchased by either RFS or IB. RFS generally retains servicing for all itsoriginated and purchased residential mortgage loans. Additionally, RFS may retain servicing forcertain mortgage loans purchased by IB. As servicer, the Firm receives servicing fees based on thesecuritized loan balance plus ancillary fees.For Firm-sponsored securitizations serviced by RFS, the Firm is deemed to have the power to directthe significant activities of the VIE as it is the servicer of the loans and is responsible fordecisions related to loan modifications and134 Table of Contentsworkouts. For the loans serviced by unrelated third parties, the Firm is not the primarybeneficiary as the power to direct the significant activities resides with the third partyservicer. In a limited number of securitizations, RFS, in addition to having servicing rights, mayretain an interest in the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In these instances,the Firm is also deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, due to RFS's servicingarrangements and retained interests, the Firm consolidated approximately $3.4&nbsp;billion of assets andliabilities of Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization trusts. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009,RFS did not consolidate any VIEs in accordance with the accounting treatment under prior accountingrules. Additionally, RFS held retained interests of approximately $343&nbsp;million and $537&nbsp;million asof March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively, in nonconsolidated securitization entities.See page 141 of this Note for further information on retained interests held in nonconsolidatedVIEs; these retained interests are classified as trading assets or AFS securities.IB may engage in underwriting and trading activities of the securities issued by Firm-sponsoredsecuritization trusts. As a result, IB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests(including residual interests) in residential mortgage securitizations upon securitization, and/orreacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instancesas a result of the size of the positions retained or reacquired by IB, when considered togetherwith the servicing arrangements entered into by RFS, the Firm is deemed to be the primarybeneficiary of certain trusts. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm consolidated approximately $1.4billion of VIE assets and liabilities due to IB's involvement with such trusts. These entities werenot consolidated at December&nbsp;31, 2009, in accordance with the accounting treatment under prioraccounting rules. Additionally, IB held approximately $482&nbsp;million, and $699&nbsp;million of senior andsubordinated interests as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively, innonconsolidated securitization entities. This includes approximately $1&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million ofresidual interests as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31,2009, respectively. See page 137 of thisNote for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations. These retainedinterests are accounted for at fair value and classified as trading assets.The Firm's mortgage loan sales are primarily nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the riskof future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust.However, for a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the creditrisk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 22on pages 149-152 of this Form 10-Qfor additional information on loans sold with recourse, as well as information on indemnificationsfor breaches of representations and warranties.Commercialmortgages and other consumer securitizationsIB securitizes commercial mortgage loans that it originates and may also engage in underwriting andtrading of securities issued by the securitization trusts. IB may retain unsold senior and/orsubordinated interests in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization butgenerally does not service commercial loan securitizations. For loans serviced by unrelated thirdparties, the Firm generally does not have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIEand, therefore, does not consolidate the VIEs. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm consolidatedapproximately $823&nbsp;million of commercial mortgage securitization trusts due to the Firm holdingcertain subordinated interests that give the Firm the power to direct the activities of theseentities. These entities were not consolidated at December&nbsp;31, 2009, in accordance with theaccounting treatment under prior accounting rules. At both March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009,the Firm held $1.6&nbsp;billion of retained interests in nonconsolidated commercial mortgagesecuritizations. This includes approximately $12&nbsp;million and $22&nbsp;million of residual interests asof March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, respectively.The Firm also securitizes automobile and student loans originated by RFS, and consumer loans(including automobile and student loans) purchased by IB. The Firm retains servicingresponsibilities for all originated and certain purchased student and automobile loans. It alsoholds a retained interest in these securitizations. As such, the Firm is the primary beneficiary ofand consolidates these VIEs as of March&nbsp;31, 2010. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm consolidated $4.9billion of assets and liabilities of automobile and student loan securitizations. As of December31, 2009, the Firm held $9&nbsp;million and $49&nbsp;million of retained interests in nonconsolidatedsecuritized automobile and student loan securitizations, respectively. These entities were notconsolidated at December&nbsp;31, 2009, in accordance with the accounting treatment under prioraccounting rules. In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Firm consolidated $3.8&nbsp;billion of otherstudent loans.Re-securitizationsThe Firm also engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities aretransferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur to both agency(Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs and are oftenstructured on behalf of clients. As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm did not consolidate any agencyre-securitizations, as it did not have the power to direct the significant activities of the trust.As of March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm consolidated $365&nbsp;million of assets and liabilities of private labelre-135 Table of Contentssecuritizations, as the Firm had both the power to direct the significant activities of, andretained an interest that is deemed to be significant in the trust. For other nonconsolidatedprivate label re-securitizations, the Firm did not have the sole power to direct the significantactivities of the entity. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm transferred $6.5billion and $383&nbsp;million of securities to agency and private-label VIEs. At March&nbsp;31, 2010, theFirm held approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion and $23&nbsp;million of senior and subordinated interests,respectively in nonconsolidated agency and private-label re-securitization entities. See pages140-142 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizationVIEs.Multi-sellerconduitsEffective January&nbsp;1, 2010, the Firm consolidated its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, asthe Firm had both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentiallysignificant economic interest. The Firm directs the economic performance of the conduits asadministrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions for the conduits. In these roles,the Firm makes decisions regarding concentration of asset types and credit quality of transactions,and is responsible for managing the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm'sinterests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received asadministrative agent, liquidity provider and provider of program-wide credit enhancement, as wellas the Firm's potential exposure as a result of the liquidity and credit enhancement facilitiesprovided to the conduits.For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with Firm-administeredmulti-seller conduits, as well as the accounting treatment applicable under prior accounting rules,see Note 16 on pages 206-209 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduitsThe Firm provides both deal-specific and program-wide liquidity facilities. Because themajority of the deal-specific liquidity facilities will only fund nondefaulted assets, program-widecredit enhancement is required to absorb losses on defaulted receivables in excess of lossesabsorbed by any deal-specific credit enhancement. Program-wide credit enhancement may be providedby JPMorgan Chase in the form of standby letters of credit or by third-party surety bond providers.The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required varies by conduit and ranges between 5% and10% of applicable commercial paper outstanding. The Firm provided $2.4&nbsp;billion of program-widecredit enhancement at March&nbsp;31, 2010.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with investorintermediation activities, see Note 16 on pages 209-212 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Municipal bond vehiclesThe Firm consolidates municipal bond vehicles if it owns the residual interest. The residualinterest generally allows the owner to make decisions that significantly impact the economicperformance of the municipal bond vehicle, primarily by directing the sale of the municipal bondsowned by the vehicle. In addition, the residual interest owners have the right to receive benefitsand bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm doesnot consolidate municipal bond vehicles if it does not own the residual interests since the Firmdoes not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of themunicipal bond vehicle.136 Table of ContentsThe Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31,2009, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, were as follows.&nbsp;Credit-linked note vehiclesThe Firm structures transactions with credit-linked note vehicles in which the VIE purchases highlyrated assets, such as asset-backed securities, or enters into a credit derivative contract with theFirm to obtain exposure to a referenced credit which the VIE otherwise does not hold. The VIE thenissues CLNs with maturities predominantly ranging from one to ten years in order to transfer therisk of the referenced credit to the VIE's investors. The Firm does not generally consolidate thesecredit-linked note entities since the Firm does not have the power to direct the significantactivities of these entities and does not have a variable interest that could potentially besignificant.Exposure to nonconsolidated credit-linked note VIEs at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, wasas follows.&nbsp;137 Table of ContentsAsset swap vehiclesThe Firm structures and executes transactions with asset swap vehicles on behalf of investors. Insuch transactions, the VIE purchases a specific asset or assets and then enters into a derivativewith the Firm in order to tailor the interest rate or currency risk, or both, according toinvestors' requirements. The Firm does not generally consolidate these asset swap vehicles, sincethe Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and doesnot have a variable interest that could potentially be significant.Exposure to nonconsolidated asset swap VIEs at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, was asfollows.&nbsp;VIEs sponsored by third partiesInvestment in a third-party credit card securitization trustThe Firm holds two interests in a third-party-sponsored VIE, which is a credit card securitizationtrust that owns credit card receivables issued by a national retailer. The Firm is not the primarybeneficiary of the trust, as the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIEthat most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. The first note is structured so thatthe principal amount can float up to 47% of the principal amount of the receivables held by thetrust, not to exceed $4.2&nbsp;billion. The Firm accounts for its investment at fair value within AFSsecurities. At both March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, the amortized cost of the note was $3.5billion, and the fair value was $3.7&nbsp;billion and $3.5&nbsp;billion, respectively. The Firm accounts forits other interest, which is not subject to limits, as a loan at amortized cost. This senior loanhad an amortized cost and fair value of approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion at both March&nbsp;31, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009. For more information on AFS securities and loans, see Notes 11 and 13 on pages120-124 and 125-129, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.VIE used in FRBNY transactionIn conjunction with the Bear Stearns merger, in June&nbsp;2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York(&#147;FRBNY&#148;) took control, through an LLC formed for this purpose, of a portfolio of $30.0&nbsp;billion inassets, based on the value of the portfolio as of March&nbsp;14, 2008. The assets of the LLC were fundedby a $28.85&nbsp;billion term loan from the FRBNY and a $1.15&nbsp;billion subordinated loan from JPMorganChase. The JPMorgan Chase loan is subordinated to the FRBNY loan and will bear the first $1.15billion of any losses of the portfolio. Any remaining assets in the portfolio after repayment ofthe FRBNY loan, repayment of the JPMorgan Chase loan and the expense of the LLC will be for theaccount of the FRBNY. The extent to which the FRBNY and JPMorgan Chase loans will be repaid willdepend on the value of the assets in the portfolio and the liquidation strategy directed by theFRBNY. The Firm does not consolidate the LLC, as it does not have the power to direct theactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance.Other VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, forexample, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placementagent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's length, and individualcredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration thequality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activitiesof the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interestthat could potentially be significant, the Firm records and reports these positions on itsConsolidated Balance Sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions from anyother third-party transaction.138 Table of ContentsConsolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs that areconsolidated by the Firm as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.&nbsp;139 Table of ContentsSupplemental information on loan securitizationsThe Firm securitizes and sells a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card,automobile, student, and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans, as well as debtsecurities. The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investordemand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.For a discussion of the accounting treatment under prior accounting rules relating to loansecuritizations, see Note 1 on pages 142-143 and Note 15 on pages 198-205 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Securitization activityThe following tables provide information related to the Firm's securitization activities for thethree months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsoredsecuritization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, as sale accounting was achievedbased on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization. For the periodspresented, no mortgage loans were securitized, and there were no cash flows from the Firm to theSPEs related to recourse or guarantee arrangements. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2010, all of theFirm-sponsored credit card, student loan and auto securitization trusts were consolidated as aresult of the new consolidation guidance related to VIEs and, accordingly, are not included in thesecuritization activity tables below for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.&nbsp;In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm soldresidential mortgage loans totaling $33.8&nbsp;billion and $38.2&nbsp;billion during the three months endedMarch&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of these loan sales were for securitization byGinnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The Firm generally retains the right to service theseresidential mortgage loans in accordance with the respective servicing guidelines and standards.These sales resulted in pretax gains of $20&nbsp;million and $17&nbsp;million during the three months endedMarch&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.JPMorgan Chase's interest in securitized assets held at fair valueThe following table summarizes the Firm's nonconsolidated securitization interests, which arecarried at fair value on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31,2009. The risk ratings are periodically reassessed as information becomes available. As of March31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, 71% and 76%, respectively, of the Firm's retained securitizationinterests, which are carried at fair value, were risk-rated &#147;A&#148; or better.140 Table of Contents&nbsp;The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value as ofMarch&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, of certain of the Firm's retained interests innonconsolidated VIEs, other than MSRs, that are valued using modeling techniques. The table belowalso outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes inassumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs,see Note 16 on pages 144-145 ofthis Form 10-Q.&nbsp;141 Table of ContentsThe sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value basedon a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivitiesalso do not reflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks.Loan delinquencies and net charge-offsThe table below includes information about delinquencies, net charge-offs, and components ofoff-balance sheet securitized financial assets as of March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009.&nbsp;142 Table of ContentsNOTE 16 &#151; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS For a discussion of accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note17 on pages 214&#151;217 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillThe following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.The $2&nbsp;million increase in goodwill from December&nbsp;31, 2009, was largely due to foreigncurrency translation adjustments related to the Firm's Canadian credit card operations, offset bythe divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses, as well as tax-related purchase accountingadjustments associated with the Bank One merger.Goodwill was not impaired at March&nbsp;31, 2010, or December&nbsp;31, 2009, nor was any goodwill written offdue to impairment during either of the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 or 2009. During the firstquarter, in addition to reviewing the current conditions and prior projections for all of itsreporting units, the Firm updated the discounted cash flow valuations of its consumer lendingbusinesses in RFS and Card Services, as these businesses continue to have elevated risk forgoodwill impairment due to their exposure to U.S. consumer credit risk. As a result of this review,the Firm concluded that goodwill for these businesses and the Firm's other reporting units was notimpaired at March&nbsp;31, 2010.143 Table of ContentsMortgage servicing rightsFor a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuationmethodology of MSRs, see Notes 3 and 17 on pages 151-152 and 214-217, respectively, of JPMorganChase's 2009 Annual Report.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including theimpact of MSR risk management activities) for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.144 Table of ContentsThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's MSRs at March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009; and it outlines the sensitivities of thosefair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used withcaution. Changes in fair value based on a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot beeasily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change infair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particularassumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. Inreality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteractthe sensitivities.Other intangible assetsFor the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010, purchased credit card relationships, other creditcard-related intangibles, core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets decreased $238million, primarily reflecting amortization expense.The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were asfollows.Amortization expenseThe Firm's intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives in a mannerthat best reflects the economic benefits of the intangible asset. The $517&nbsp;million of intangibleassets related to asset management advisory contracts were determined to have an indefinite lifeand are not amortized.The following table presents amortization expense related to credit card relationships, coredeposits and other intangible assets.145 Table of ContentsFuture amortization expenseThe following table presents estimated future amortization expense related to credit cardrelationships, core deposits and other intangible assets.NOTE 17 &#151; DEPOSITS For further discussion of deposits, see Note 19 on page 218 in JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.At March&nbsp;31, 2010, and December&nbsp;31, 2009, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were asfollows.NOTE 18 &#151; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS The following table details the components of other borrowed funds.146 Table of ContentsNOTE 19 &#151; EARNINGS PER SHAREFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;), see Note 25 onpage 224 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation ofbasic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009.NOTE 20 &#151; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains andlosses on AFS securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of relatedderivatives), cash flow hedging activities and net loss and prior service cost/(credit) related tothe Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.147 Table of ContentsNOTE 21 &#151; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFor a discussion of the Firm's commitments and contingencies, see Note 30 on page 230 of JPMorganChase's 2009 Annual Report.Litigation reserveThe Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. At March&nbsp;31,2010, the Firm and its subsidiaries were named as a defendant or were otherwise involved in severalthousand legal proceedings, investigations and litigations in various jurisdictions around theworld. The Firm's material legal proceedings are described inItem&nbsp;1: Legal Proceedings on pages163 - 170 of this Form 10-Q, to which reference is hereby made.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its cases. The Firm accrues for alitigation-related liability when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and theamount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its litigations, proceedingsand investigations each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in suchreserves, upwards or downwards as appropriate, based on management's best judgment afterconsultation with counsel. In the first quarter of 2010, the Firm added approximately $2.9&nbsp;billionto its litigation reserves, primarily related to mortgage-related litigation, includingmortgage-related lawsuits arising from actions taken by the Firm and certain of its heritage firms.There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in thefuture.The Firm's legal proceedings range from cases involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuitswith classes involving thousands of plaintiffs. These cases involve each of the various lines ofbusiness of the Firm and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claimsand statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novelfactual claims or legal theories. While some cases pending against the Firm specify the damagesclaimed by the plaintiff, many seek an indeterminate amount of damages or are at very early stages.The Firm does not believe a meaningful aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (as definedby the relevant accounting literature) can be determined for asserted and probable unassertedclaims as of March&nbsp;31, 2010.The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currentlyoutstanding litigations, and it intends to defend itself vigorously in all its cases.Based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking intoconsideration its current litigation reserves, the Firm believes that the legal actions,proceedings and investigations currently pending against it should not have a material adverseeffect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. However, in light of the uncertaintiesinvolved in such proceedings, actions and investigations, there is no assurance that the ultimateresolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by theFirm; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operatingresults for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss orliability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.148 Table of ContentsNOTE 22 &#151; OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, GUARANTEES AND OTHERCOMMITMENTSJPMorgan Chase utilizes lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) tomeet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instrumentsrepresents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or theFirm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and the counterparty subsequentlyfail to perform according to the terms of the contract. These commitments and guarantees oftenexpire without being drawn, and even higher proportions expire without a default. As a result, thetotal contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of itsactual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For a discussion of off-balance sheetlending-related financial instruments and guarantees, and the Firm's related accounting policies,see Note 31 on pages 230-234 of JPMorgan Chase's 2009 Annual Report.To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, an allowance for creditlosses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 onpage 130 of this Form 10-Q forfurther discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheetlending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March&nbsp;31, 2010, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2009. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-relatedcommitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced,and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized atthe same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by providing the borrower priornotice or, in some cases, without notice as permitted by law.Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments149
