&nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.OverviewJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is a leading global financial services firm withassets of $759&nbsp;billion and operations in more than 50 countries. The Firmserves more than 30&nbsp;million consumer customers and the world's most prominentcorporate, institutional and government clients. The Firm's wholesalebusinesses are comprised of the Investment Bank, Treasury & SecuritiesServices, Investment Management & Private Banking and JPMorgan Partners. ChaseFinancial Services is composed of the Firm's retail and middle marketbusinesses.Financial performance of JPMorgan Chasebp- Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;) reported 2002 netincome of $1.7&nbsp;billion, or $0.80 per share, compared with net income of $1.7billion, or $0.80 per share, in 2001. The results for the year were negativelyaffected by sluggish capital markets, by concentrated exposures in certainsegments of the Firm's private equity and commercial credit portfolios, bylarge charges related to litigation and by continuing integration expensesresulting from the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase. On the positive side, theconsumer businesses reported record results, and Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;T&SS&#148;) had a solid year, highlighting the benefits of the Firm'sdiversified business model.As a result of the Firm's balance of businesses, 2002 total reported revenuesof $29.6&nbsp;billion were up 1% from 2001. The national consumer credit businessesat Chase Financial Services (&#147;CFS&#148;) benefited from the low-interest rateenvironment, with the mortgage company, in particular, having an exceptionalyear. T&SS reported modest revenue growth, as strong gains in TreasuryServices and Institutional Trust Services offset a decline in InvestorServices. At the Investment Bank (&#147;IB&#148;), the slower-than-expected economicrecovery and diminished investor confidence led to continued weakness incapital markets activity, which was reflected in lower trading revenue andinvestment banking fees. Investment Management & Private Banking (&#147;IMPB&#148;)revenues declined as a result of lower global equity valuations and reducedinvestor activity; assets under supervision declined primarily due to marketdepreciation and institutional outflows. Deterioration in equity marketsadversely affected JPMorgan Partners (&#147;JPMP&#148;); write-offs and write-downs ofprivate holdings and net mark-to-market losses on public securities were notoffset by cash gains, as financing and exit opportunities remainedconstrained.The Firm's total reported noninterest expense declined 4% from 2001 andincluded several large charges in both years. In 2002, the costs associatedwith merger and restructuring initiatives were $1.2&nbsp;billion, versus $2.5billion the previous year. Also in 2002, the Firm recorded a $1.3&nbsp;billioncharge in connection with the settlement of its Enron-related suretylitigation and the establishment of a reserve related to certain materiallitigation, proceedings and investigations and recorded a $0.1&nbsp;billion chargerelated to excess real estate. Excluding the impact of these charges in bothyears, the Firm's full-year 2002 noninterest expense of $20.2&nbsp;billion waslower than that of 2001.In addition, in 2002, the Firm announced several programs aiming to alignexpense levels with lower revenue prospects. Severance and related costs fromthese initiatives added $890&nbsp;million to noninterest expense for the year,approximately 70% of which were in IB. Despite those costs, all businesssegments reported lower-to-flat noninterest expenses, except CFS, where higherbusiness volumes drove expense growth. IB reduced headcount in line with lowermarket activity levels. IMPB has reduced its expense run-rate by more than halfa billion dollars since the beginning of 2001. In T&SS, tight expensemanagement allowed for investments while keeping expense levels flat with 2001levels. The Firm's expenses were further reduced by the adoption in 2002 ofSFAS 142, which eliminated the amortization of goodwill.The provision for credit losses increased 36% from 2001. This was principallyattributable to troubled commercial credits in the telecommunications andcable sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the consumer provision.In addition to analyzing results on a reported basis, management looks atresults on an &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess the overall Firm and each of itsbusiness segments and to facilitate an estimate of future earnings for thebusiness segments, absent unusual events. JPMorgan Chase's operating earnings,which exclude merger and restructuring costs and special items, were $3.4billion, compared with $3.8&nbsp;billion in 2001. For additional information and areconciliation between the Firm's reported and operating results, see pages 22and 23.Risk managementManagement of credit, market, operational and private equity risk is centralto the Firm's businesses.Total nonperforming assets rose to $4.8&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, anincrease of 22% from year-end 2001, primarily as a result of significant andrapid deterioration in credit quality in the telecommunications, cable andmerchant energy sectors. The Firm established a more stringent exposure reviewprocess and lower absolute exposure limits for industry and single-nameconcentrations, including investment-grade obligors. &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Market risk parameters across the Firm remained stable, and trading resultswere within Value-at-risk (&#147;VAR&#148;) limits throughout the year.The Firm continued to develop its self-assessment, operational risk-eventmonitoring and internal control processes to enhance its operational riskmanagement discipline.The Firm created a Policy Review Office to enhance the procedures it uses toexamine transactions with clients in terms of appropriateness, ethical issuesand reputational risk. The Policy Review Office has intensified the scrutinyof the Firm's transactions from the client's point of view, with the goalthat these transactions are not used to deceive investors or others.Finally, the Firm reviewed the level of private equity risk in its portfolioand has decided to reduce, over time, the amount of capital invested inprivate equity to approximately 10% of the Firm's common stockholders' equity,from approximately 20% at December&nbsp;31, 2002.Capital and liquidity managementAt December&nbsp;31, 2002, the Firm's Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.2%, compared with8.3% at year-end 2001. In the third quarter, the Board of Directors declaredits intention to continue the current quarterly dividend of $0.34 per shareon the Firm's common stock, provided that capital ratios remain strong andearnings prospects exceed the current dividend.Sound liquidity management remains an important factor in maintaining theFirm's credit ratings. Liquidity management takes into account the need tofund both on- and off-balance sheet liabilities and commitments. It seeks toensure that the Firm's obligations will be met even if access to funding istemporarily impaired. Although the Firm's debt ratings were downgraded onenotch this year to AA-/Aa3 at JPMorgan Chase Bank and to A&#043;/A1 at the holdingcompany, the Firm's funding costs and capital markets businesses were notmaterially adversely affected.Corporate governanceThe Firm has adopted the New York Stock Exchange proposals relating tocorporate governance practices for boards of directors and has posted theboard's practices, as well as charters of the principal board committees, onthe Firm's website, www.jpmorganchase.com. The Firm seeks to be a leader incorporate governance and disclosure practices.Business outlookGlobal economic conditions and activity in financial markets are expected toremain uncertain in 2003. Accordingly, the outlook for the Firm's investmentbanking and capital markets activities remains cautious. Earnings improvementsin IB are anticipated to be primarily driven in 2003 by lower credit costs ina still challenging &#151; but stabilizing &#151; credit environment and by lowerexpenses. At CFS, continuation of the current low-interest rate environmentshould enable the credit-related businesses (mortgage, credit card and auto)to perform well, although it is likely revenues and earnings will be lowerthan the record set in 2002, which included large net gains on hedging ofmortgage servicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;).Expenses for the Firm in 2003 may be slightly higher than in 2002 (excludingfrom 2002 expenses the impact of the litigation and merger charges). Expensingstock options, higher pension and occupancy costs and increased spending(primarily at CFS) are likely to more than offset the savings anticipated fromIB right-sizing initiatives and lower severance costs.Despite this cautious view for the short term, the Firm remains committed toits diversified business model and believes that it is well positioned toproduce higher returns when economic conditions improve and capital marketsrecover.Results of operationsThis section discusses JPMorgan Chase's results of operations on a reportedbasis. The accompanying financial data conforms with U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The section should be read in conjunction withthe financial statements and footnotes beginning on page 71.Investment banking fees were 24% lower than last year, reflecting theindustry-wide slowdown in corporate M&A activities and new issuance of debt andequity securities. Advisory fees of $756&nbsp;million were 39% lower than last year,and underwriting fees for debt and equity instruments of $2.0&nbsp;billion were 15%lower than last year. For a table that breaks out investment banking fees, seeNote 4 on page 77, and for a further discussion on these revenues, see the IBresults on pages 26&#151;28.RevenuesNM-Not meaningful.The 47% decline in trading revenue was primarily attributable to thechallenging market conditions that persisted throughout 2002. &nbsp;Equity markets declined substantially, contributing to lower client activityand revenues, primarily in equity derivatives. Also contributing to lowerequity trading results was a shift in the classification of broker-dealertrading revenues, from &#147;trading revenues&#148; in 2001 to &#147;brokerage andinvestment services fees&#148; in 2002. Beginning in 2001, bid and offer prices onNasdaq stocks were quoted in dollars and cents, instead of fractions of wholedollars. As a result, in 2002, JPMorgan Chase began to negotiate with itsinstitutional clients commission-based pricing structures that would supportthe costs of delivering enhanced brokerage services in connection with theirNasdaq trades. Revenues earned from agreed-upon commissions are now recordedas &#147;brokerage and investment services&#148; within Fees and commissions.Fixed income trading revenues declined 33% from last year, as lower portfoliomanagement results, primarily in interest rate trading, offset an overallincrease in client activity.Trading revenue, on a reported basis, excludes the impact of net interestincome related to IB's trading activities; this income is recorded within Netinterest income. However, in assessing the profitability of IB's tradingbusiness, the Firm combines these revenues for segment reporting. For a tablethat breaks out trading revenues, see Note 3 on page 76, and for a furtherdiscussion on these revenues, see the IB results on pages 26&#150;28.Fees and commissionsFees and commissions were $10.8&nbsp;billion in 2002, an increase of 13% from lastyear, reflecting the following:These fees and commissions were offset by lower investment management,custody and processing service fees. These fees were down 5% to $3.8&nbsp;billionin 2002, primarily a result of the lower value of equity-related assets undersupervision at IMPB, as well as lower fees earned at T&SS from non-U.S.assets under custody. Both investment management and custody fees wereaffected by the decline in the value of assets under supervision and assetsunder custody, respectively, as these fees are generally calculated as apercentage of the total market value of the assets. Also contributing to thelower fees was the market-driven slowdown in securities lending, as well as adecrease in processing service fees for unit investment trusts.Brokerage and investment services declined slightly, despite the aforementionedreclassification into this line of approximately $100&nbsp;million of broker-dealerrevenues related to Nasdaq transactions. The decline was the result of reducedtrading volume and narrower spreads on brokerage transactions.For a table showing the components of Fees andcommissions, see Note 4 on page 77.Private equity gains (losses)Aggregate private equity losses (realized and unrealized) totaled $746&nbsp;millionin 2002, reflecting the continuing difficult capital markets environment. Theprivate equity markets offered limited exit opportunities and constrainedfinancing, thereby depressing realized gains. Further, the results in 2002reflected net mark-to-market losses on public securities, as well aswrite-downs and write-offs on private holdings, particularly in thetelecommunications and technology sectors. For a further discussion ofprivate equity gains (losses), see JPMP results on pages 33&#150;34.Securities gainsSecurities gains of $1.6&nbsp;billion were up 80% from last year. Of these gains,$1.1&nbsp;billion was attributable to the Firm's available-for-sale (&#147;AFS&#148;)investment securities portfolio, which was favorably positioned in a lowerinterest rate environment. The balance was directly related to the hedging ofMSRs that offset impairment charges due to mortgage prepayments. For a furtherdiscussion of securities gains, see both the IB and Chase Home Financediscussions on pages 26&#150;28 and 36, respectively.Other revenueThe increase in Other revenue of $260&nbsp;million reflected the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.For a table that breaks out Other revenue, see Note 4 on page 78.Net interest incomeNet interest income (&#147;NII&#148;) rose 7% to $11.5&nbsp;billion, compared with $10.8billion in 2001. The primary contributors to the increase were thesignificant growth in average consumer loans, which were 7% higher than lastyear, and higher trading-related NII. These were offset by a decline incommercial loans and the narrowing of spreads in the deposit businesses.Average consumer loan volume grew, benefiting from low interest rates, aswell as the acquisition in February 2002 of the Providian Master Trust,including $7.9&nbsp;billion of credit card receivables and related relationships.Total average credit card receivables rose 11% to $21.6&nbsp;billion; of thisamount $4.8&nbsp;billion related to Providian. NII at Chase Home Finance increaseddue to higher average available-for-sale mortgage loans, higher spreads andlower asset funding costs.NII related to commercial loans declined, the result of lower outstandingvolumes. At the same time, spreads narrowed, reflecting the reduction ininterest rates. Also contributing to the decline was the higher level ofnonperforming loans. Nonperforming commercial loans rose 84% to $3.7&nbsp;billion.For a further discussion of nonperforming loans in the commercial portfolio,see page 47.A portion of the Firm's NII relates to trading-related assets. In 2002, thiscomponent was $1.9&nbsp;billion, compared with $1.4&nbsp;billion in the prior year. Theincrease was attributable to the change in the composition of trading assetsand improved spreads.On an aggregate basis, the Firm's total average interest-earning assets for2002 were $555&nbsp;billion, compared with $547&nbsp;billion last year. The netinterest spread on these assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was2.09% in 2002, 10 basis points higher than last year.ExpensesNM- Not meaningful.Compensation expenseCompensation expense in 2002 was $11.0&nbsp;billion, 7% lower than last year, andincluded severance costs of $746&nbsp;million associated with expense initiativesundertaken during the year. In 2001, severance related to the merger of J.P.Morgan and Chase and other previously announced restructuring programs wasrecorded within Merger and restructuring costs. The decline reflectedreductions in staffing levels, as well as lower incentives reflecting thelower level of earnings. The amounts accrued for incentives are subject tomanagement's discretion and to calculations that correlate incentives withincome before incentives.Expense-management programs had a significant impact in IB and, to a lesserextent, IMPB, the two business segments whose revenues were most negativelyaffected by the downturn in the economy. As a result, these two segmentsreduced the number of employees in their businesses. Also contributing to thedecline in expenses was the reversal of previously accrued expenses of $120million related to forfeitable stock-based compensation awards issued underemployee benefit plans. The awards contained stock price targets that weredeemed unlikely to be attained within the timeframes specified under theterms of the awards.The decline in compensation expense was partially offset by the hiring of newemployees at expanding business segments, primarily CFS and T&SS.The total number of full-time equivalent employees at December&nbsp;31, 2002, was94,335, compared with 95,812 at the prior year-end. Although overall levelsremained relatively stable, headcount in IB and IMPB was reduced byapproximately 3,100 full-time equivalent employees, whereas in CFS headcountincreased by more than 2,400.The Firm reviews the actuarial assumptions for its pension and otherpostretirement benefit plans on an annual basis. To reflect the decline inmarket interest rates during 2002, the year-end discount rate for the Firm'sU.S. plans was set at 6.50%, a 75-basis point decline from the prior year.Additionally, considering the current mix of plan assets, the year-end assumedlong-term rate of return was adjusted downward to 8.00% for both U.S. pensionplan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets, from 9.25% and9.00%, respectively. The assumed long-term rate of return is a blended averageof the Firm's investment advisor's projected long-term (10&nbsp;years or more)returns for various asset classes. The impact of these changes is expected toincrease 2003 U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit expenses byapproximately $60&nbsp;million. Additionally, the adverse effect of losses on U.S.plan assets is expected to further increase U.S. pension and otherpostretirement benefit expenses by approximately $70&nbsp;million. In 2002, theseexpenses included curtailment charges and special termination benefitstotaling $64&nbsp;million resulting from management-initiated andoutsourcing-related employee terminations. Actuarial assumptions for theFirm's various non-U.S. plans also were adjusted to reflect local marketconditions. The impact of these changes on non- &nbsp;U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit expenses is not expected to bematerial. For further information on postretirement employee benefit plans,see Note 23 on pages 94&#150;96.Occupancy expenseOccupancy expense rose 19% from last year, partly the result of a $98&nbsp;millioncharge in the third quarter of 2002 to cover the costs of exiting excessvacant premises on the West Coast of the United States, principally in the SanFrancisco area. Also contributing to the increase was the leasing ofadditional space in New Jersey and in midtown Manhattan, partly necessitatedby the relocation of certain functions at the beginning of the year from apreviously-owned building in downtown Manhattan. The Firm expects 2003occupancy costs to increase by approximately $150&nbsp;million due to the move tomidtown Manhattan, extra safety measures and higher anticipated real estatetaxes in New York.Technology and communications expenseThe decline in Technology and communications expense was primarilyattributable to an initiative to rationalize and reshape the Firm's technologyinfrastructure. This initiative resulted in reduced spending for software,equipment and workstations. Additionally, the technology sourcing process wasstreamlined in favor of a select list of preferred vendors, resulting inadditional expense reductions. The impact of these initiatives was partiallyoffset by the higher amortization of capitalized software, as well asexpenditures to enhance the telecommunications network.Amortization of intangiblesAmortization of intangibles declined 56% from 2001. The decline primarilyreflected the implementation of SFAS 142, which now requires a periodicreview of goodwill for impairment rather than the amortization of goodwill,as was the case last year. This was partly offset by the impact of theacquisition of the Providian Master Trust's credit card relationshipintangibles. In 2002, there were no impairments recognized on goodwillrecorded the Consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion on the impact ofSFAS 142 on the Firm's amortization of intangibles expense and the expectedlevel of expense for 2003, see Note 14 on page 89.Other expenseOther expense increased 6% in 2002 compared with 2001 as a result of thefollowing (for the table showing the components within Other expense, see Note6 on page 79):These expense increases were partially offset by lower travel andentertainment expense of $42&nbsp;million.Surety settlement and litigation reserveThe $1.3&nbsp;billion charge in 2002 reflected the settlement of the Enron-relatedsurety litigation and the establishment of a litigation reserve. On January&nbsp;2,2003, the Firm announced it had settled its dispute with 11 insurance companiesthat had issued surety bonds that guaranteed obligations of Enron Corp.(&#147;Enron&#148;) under prepaid commodity forward contracts. The Firm settled for 60%of the principal amount of the bonds and received a cash payment of $502million and $75&nbsp;million of unsecured claims. In connection with this agreement&#151; and one additional, ongoing lawsuit related to a prepaid contract backed bya letter of credit &#151; the Firm took a pre-tax charge of $400&nbsp;million(approximately $260&nbsp;million after-tax). The Firm also established a $900million reserve (approximately $600&nbsp;million after-tax) related to litigationand regulatory matters involving Enron, as well as other material legalactions, proceedings and investigations in which it is involved.Merger and restructuring costsDuring 2002, the Firm incurred merger and restructuring costs of $1.2billion, a 52% decline from 2001. Refer to the discussion of compensationexpense on page 20 for a description of other severance costs incurred in2002 and to Note 6 on page 78.Provision for credit lossesThe Provision for credit losses increased $1.1&nbsp;billion or 36% from the prioryear, primarily reflecting higher charge-offs of loans and lending-relatedcommitments in the telecommunications and cable sectors. The consumerprovision decreased 21% from last year reflecting growth in credit cardsecuritizations, partially offset by the impact of the Providian acquisition.In 2002, the Firm increased the allowance for credit losses by $443&nbsp;million(by making provisions in excess of net charge-offs), compared with an $850million increase in the allowance last year. For further information on theProvision for credit losses, see page 56.Income tax expenseJPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of $856&nbsp;million in 2002,compared with $847&nbsp;million in 2001. The effective tax rate was 34% in 2002,versus 33% last year. The increase in the effective tax rate was principallyattributable to the level of income in certain state and local taxjurisdictions in 2002. For a further discussion of income taxes, see Note 22on pages 93 and 94.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Reconciliation from reported results to operating basisThe Firm prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The financial statements prepared inaccordance with GAAP appear on pages 71&#150;74 of this Annual Report. Thatpresentation, which is referred to as &#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the readerwith an understanding of the Firm's results that can be consistently trackedfrom year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance withother companies' GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementlooks at results on an &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of its businesses andto measure overall Firm results against targeted goals. The definition ofoperating basis starts with the reported GAAP results and then excludes theimpact of merger and restructuring costs, credit card securitizations, theamortization of goodwill and special items (which management defined during2002 as significant nonrecurring gains or losses of $75&nbsp;million or more).Both restructuring charges and special items are viewed by management astransactions that are not part of the Firm's normal daily business operationsor are unusual in nature and therefore are not indicative of trends.The following summary table provides a reconciliation between the Firm'sreported and operating results:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As previously mentioned, operating results exclude the impact of credit cardsecuritizations. JPMorgan Chase periodically securitizes a portion of itscredit card portfolio by selling a pool of credit card receivables to a trust,which issues securities to investors. When credit card receivables aresecuritized, the Firm ceases to accrue the related interest and credit costs;instead, the Firm receives fee revenue for continuing to service thosereceivables and additional revenue from any interest and fees on thereceivables in excess of the interest paid to investors, net of credit lossesand servicing fees. As a result, securitization does not change JPMorganChase's reported or operating net income; however, it does affect theclassification of items in the Consolidated statement of income.The Firm also reports credit costs on a &#147;managed&#148; or &#147;operating&#148; basis.Credit costs on an operating basis are composed of the Provision for creditlosses in the Consolidated statement of income (which includes a provisionfor credit card receivables on the Consolidated balance sheet) as well as thecredit costs associated with securitized credit card loans. As the holder ofthe residual interest in the securitization trust, the Firm bears its shareof the credit costs for securitized loans. In the Firm's GAAP financialstatements, credit costs associated with securitized credit card loans reducethe noninterest income remitted to the Firm from the trust. This income isreported in Credit card revenue in Fees and commissions over the life of thesecuritization.Commencing January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Firm adopted SFAS 142 and, accordingly, ceasedamortizing goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of SFAS142. Prior-period operating earnings have been adjusted by adding backamortization of goodwill to report results on a basis comparable with 2002.The following table provides a reconciliation of earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;)based on the Firm's reported net income to EPS calculated on an operatingbasis.NM-Not meaningful.For a five-year trend of the Firm's results on an operating basis, see page112. All years are calculated on a basis using the same definition foroperating results. &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Segment resultsThe wholesale businesses of JPMorgan Chase are known globally as &#147;JPMorgan&#148;and are comprised of the Investment Bank, Treasury & Securities Services,Investment Management & Private Banking and JPMorgan Partners. The retail andmiddle market businesses are known as &#147;Chase&#148; and make up Chase FinancialServices.JPMorgan Chase's segment results reflect the manner in which financialinformation is currently evaluated by the Firm's management. The Firmallocates equity to its business units utilizing a risk-adjusted methodology,which quantifies credit, market and operational risks within each businessand, for JPMP, private equity risk. For a discussion of those risks, see theRisk management section on pages 45-65. The Firm allocates additional equityto its businesses incorporating an &#147;asset capital tax&#148; on managed assets andsome off-balance sheet instruments. In addition, businesses are allocatedequity equal to 100% of goodwill and 50% for certain other intangiblesgenerated through acquisitions. The Firm estimates the portfolio effect onrequired economic capital based on correlations of risk across riskcategories. This estimated diversification benefit is not allocated to thebusiness segments.The Firm uses the shareholder value added (&#147;SVA&#148;) framework to measureperformance of its business segments. To derive SVA for its businesssegments, the Firm applies a 12% (after-tax) cost of equity to each segment,except JPMP; this business is charged a 15% (after-tax) cost of equity. Thecapital elements and resultant capital charges provide the businesses withthe financial framework to evaluate the trade-off between the use of capitalby each business unit versus its return to shareholders. Capital charges arean integral part of the SVA measurement for each business. Under the Firm'seconomic capital model, economic capital is overallocated toSegment resultsOperating basisbp-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not meaningful.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the businesssegments, as compared with the Firm's total common stockholders' equity. Therevenue and SVA impact of the overallocation is reported in Support Units andCorporate. (See Glossary of terms on page 114 for a definition of SVA andpage 39 for more details).In allocating the allowance (and provision) for credit losses, each businessis responsible for its credit costs, including actual net charge-offs andchanges in the specific and expected components of the allowance. The residualcomponent of the allowance, available for losses in any business segment, ismaintained at the corporate level. Management views the residual component asnecessary to address uncertainties at December&nbsp;31, 2002, primarily in thecommercial portfolio.The segment results also reflect revenue- and expense-sharing agreementsbetween certain lines of business. In 2002, agreements between TreasuryServices and Middle Market were revised, and prior periods have been restatedto conform to the current presentation. Revenues and expenses attributed totheir shared activities are recognized in each line of business, and thedouble counting is eliminated at each of the segments (e.g., Treasury &Securities Services and Chase Financial Services). These arrangements promotecross-selling and management of shared client expenses. They also ensure thatthe contributions of both businesses are fully recognized.Prior-period segment results have been adjusted to reflect alignment of management accounting policies or changes in organizational structureamong businesses. Restatements of segment results may occur in the future.See Note 33 for further information about JPMorgan Chase's five business segments.&nbsp;Segment results (continued)Operating basis&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Investment BankJPMorgan Chase is one of the world's leading investment banks, as evidencedby the breadth of its client relationships and product capabilities. At thecenter of the Investment Bank's franchise are extensive relationships withcorporations, financial institutions, governments and institutional investorsworldwide. The Firm provides a full range of investment banking andcommercial banking products and services, including advising on corporatestrategy and structure, capital raising in equity and debt markets,sophisticated risk management and market-making in cash securities andderivative instruments in all major capital markets. The Firm also commitsits own capital to proprietary investing and trading activities to capturemarket opportunities.Selected financial databp- Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM-Not meaningful.Financial results overviewPerformance at the Investment Bank (&#147;IB&#148;) is influenced by numerous factors,including global economic conditions and their impact on capital markets andIB's clients. Changes in market share, risks and expenses can also impactfinancial performance. The year 2002 presented a challenging economic andcredit environment for investment banking. In response, IB increased itsfocus on the management of credit and market risks, as well as the managementof staffing and expense levels. While the outlook for 2003 remains uncertain,IB believes it is well positioned to improve results as economic conditionsand the capital markets recover.Reflecting the difficult market environment in 2002, IB's operating margindeclined 25% from last year. Operating revenue declined 15%, driven by areduction in capital markets and lending revenue and in investment bankingfees. This was partially offset by a 9% decline in operating expenses. Creditcosts rose to $2.4&nbsp;billion in 2002. The lower operating margin together withhigher credit costs resulted in operating earnings of $1.4&nbsp;billion, a declineof 53% from 2001.Operating revenue of $12.4&nbsp;billion consisted of investment banking fees foradvisory and underwriting services; capital markets revenue related tomarket-making, trading and investing, and corporate lending activities.Investment banking fees were 25% lower than last year. Advisory revenuesdeclined 40%, reflecting lower global announced M&A volumes. Underwriting andother fees declined 17%, reflecting lower levels of debt underwritingfollowing record levels in 2001 and lower loan syndications. Equityunderwriting revenues were down from last year, reflecting decreased marketvolumes, partially offset by increased market share.The Firm maintained its No.&nbsp;2 ranking in underwriting U.S. investment-gradebonds and its No.&nbsp;1 ranking in global loan syndications. It also improved itsranking and market share in U.S. equity and equity-related underwriting. Inaddition, the Firm finished the year ranked No.&nbsp;5 in global announced M&A.IB's Capital markets and lending activities arecomprised of four primary areas: &nbsp;Market shares and rankings (a)Fixed income includes revenues from market-making activities and fromportfolio management and proprietary risk-taking activities across thecomplete range of global fixed income markets (including government andcorporate debt, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodities markets).Treasury activities include managing the Firm's overall interest rateexposure and investment securities activities. Assets, liabilities andcapital are transfer-priced to Global Treasury to reduce the sensitivity ofbusiness segment results to changes in interest rates. Global Treasury'sactivities complement, and offer a strategic balance and diversificationbenefit to, the Firm's trading activities.Credit portfolio revenues include net interest income, credit-related feesand loan sale activity for the Investment Bank's commercial credit portfolio.Additionally, Credit portfolio revenues reflect changes in the CreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;), which is the component of the fair value of aderivative that reflects the credit quality of the counterparty (see page 51of Credit risk for a further discussion of the CVA). Credit portfoliorevenues also include the results of single-name and portfolio hedgingactivity used to manage the credit exposures arising from the Firm's lendingand derivative activities. (See pages 50&#150;53 of Credit risk for a furtherdiscussion on credit derivatives). Credit portfolio revenues also reflect anymarket gains or losses related to assets received as part of a loanrestructuring.Equities includes revenues from market-making activities, including portfoliomanagement and proprietary risk-taking in cash instruments and derivatives,across the complete range of global equity markets.IB evaluates its capital markets and lending activities by considering allrevenues related to these activities. These revenues include trading, feesand commissions, securities gains and related net interest income and otherrevenues. In addition, these activities are managed on a total-returnrevenue basis. This represents total operating revenues plus the unrealizedgains or losses on third-party or internally transfer-priced assets andliabilities in fixed income and treasury activities, which are not accountedfor on a mark-to-market basis through earnings.Capital markets and lending total-return revenues were $9.4&nbsp;billion, down 12%from 2001. Fixed income total-return revenues of $5.4&nbsp;billion decreased 14%from 2001, driven by lower portfolio management results related tomarket-making activities and lower results within proprietary risk-takingactivities, which offset higher client trading activities. Offsetting thetotal-return revenue decline was the performance of Global Treasury, whichproduced strong returns in fixed income markets. Global Treasury'stotal-return revenues of $1.5&nbsp;billion were up 59% from last year. Creditportfolio revenues were $1.4&nbsp;billion, up 32% from 2001; losses related toexposure to Enron and Argentina depressed 2001 results. The 55% decline inEquities from 2001 to $1.0&nbsp;billion was attributable to lower portfoliomanagement results in equity derivatives and lower client revenues. On anoperating revenue basis, Capital Markets revenues of $9.7&nbsp;billion in 2002were 12% below 2001.2002 Selected industry awards &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P.

Excludingthese costs, expenses would have been down 16%, with compensation costs down25% and noncompensation costs down 2% from 2001. The decline in compensationcosts reflected lower incentive compensation, as well as the impact of lowerstaffing levels. Lower noncompensation costs reflected declines in travel andentertainment costs and lower technology and communications costs, partiallyoffset by higher legal costs. Including the severance and related costs, theoverhead ratio for 2002 was 64%, compared with 60% in 2001. Excluding theseverance and related costs, the overhead ratio was 60% in 2002.In October 2002, IB completed a review of all major businesses. The analysisunderscored the value of the Firm's integrated business model, the breadth ofits product offerings and the strength of the client franchise. To improvefinancial performance under current market conditions, IB announced a seriesof initiatives intended to improve efficiency as well as enable selectivestrategic investment. These initiatives, which began in the fourth quarter of2002, are expected to generate approximately $700&nbsp;million of savings andresult in a reduction in staffing levels of more than 2,000, as well as areduction in consultants employed by the Firm. Severance and other costsrelated to these initiatives are estimated at approximately $450&nbsp;million,with $293&nbsp;million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the remainingcosts to be recognized in 2003. Another $294&nbsp;million of severance and relatedcosts recorded in 2002 related to initiatives announced earlier in the year.In a revenue environment similar to 2002, and with credit costs substantiallylower than in 2002, these initiatives would enable the Investment Bank totarget a return on equity of 12% in 2003.Credit costs increased 108%, reflecting significantly higher charge-offs,primarily in the telecommunications and cable sectors, and provisions in excessof charge-offs.

Expense discipline mitigated aweak revenue environment. Revenue growth of 2% was limited by weakness in theeconomy and financial markets.Operating revenue increase of 2% was driven by growth at Institutional TrustServices (&#147;ITS&#148;) of 14%. Growth came mainly from new business volumes inglobal securities clearance and securitization services. Acquisitions alsoprovided growth, most notably Systems & Services Technologies, Inc., athird-party and backup servicer specializing in subprime auto receivables,which generated $40&nbsp;million of new revenue in 2002. Revenue at TreasuryServices rose 5% on higher revenues associated with middle market customers,increased volumes, new product initiatives and higher balance deficiencyfees. Revenue at Investor Services contracted 9% as the value of assets heldin custody and, consequently, fees declined. Foreign exchange revenuedropped, along with securities lending activity due to reduced marketactivity. Also contributing to the decline were higher deposit balances in2001 following the events of September&nbsp;11, as clients looked to depositoryinstitutions to hold cash funds. Across all business units, low interestrates have reduced earnings from the value of deposits linked to transactionprocessing. T&SS results for 2002 included a pre-tax gain of $50&nbsp;million onthe sale of the Firm's interest in Centrale de Livraison de ValeursMobilieres (&#147;CEDEL&#148;), an overseas securities clearing firm. &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P.

Global economic conditions remained weak in 2002. In addition,poor investor sentiment driven by the uncertain economic outlook andconcerns surrounding corporate governance weighed heavily on the financialmarkets. These factors led to significantly depressed equity markets (theS&P 500 index declined 23% for the year 2002) and reduced levels of investoractivity across IMPB's private banking and retail client bases. In responseto these challenges, IMPB undertook restructuring and productivity programsand reduced incentives, without impairing its core capabilities. IMPB iswell positioned to enhance earnings when economic conditions improve.Operating revenue of $2.9&nbsp;billion was 11% lower than last year. InvestmentManagement operating revenues of $1.5&nbsp;billion decreased 11% from the prioryear, reflecting the impact of equity market depreciation and institutionaloutflows across all asset classes. During the third quarter of 2002, Brown &Co., the Firm's specialty online brokerage unit, was transferred from CFS toIMPB as part of the Firm's strategy to grow its retail asset managementbusiness. (All prior periods have been restated to reflect thereorganization.)Private Banking operating revenues of $1.4&nbsp;billion decreased 12% from 2001.Net interest income decreased 15%, reflecting the Private Bank's smaller loanportfolio and lower deposit balances, as well as narrower interest ratespreads. Fees from assets under management declined as a result of equitymarket depreciation and client outflows in the early part of 2002. Brokeragecommissions declined as Private Banking clients executed fewer transactions.Leadership positions: &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P.

Assets under management represent assets actively managed by IMPBon behalf of private banking, institutional and retail clients. AUM atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, declined 15% from the prior year-end primarily due toequity market depreciation and institutional outflows, offset by an increasein retail mutual fund assets. Custody, restricted stock, deposit andbrokerage accounts, which are lower-fee products than AUM, declined 20%. Thediversification of AUS across client segments, geographic regions andproduct classes helps to mitigate the impact of market volatility onrevenues.

Opportunities to realize value through sales or initial publicofferings (&#147;IPOs&#148;) of investments were limited, because of constrained M&Aand IPO markets. In addition, JPMP recorded negative valuation adjustmentsin investments concentrated in telecommunications and technology,industries that continue to face poor operating conditions and limitedfinancing opportunities.Private equity losses totaled $733&nbsp;million in 2002, consisting of losses of$647&nbsp;million in direct investments and $150&nbsp;million in private funds,partially offset by $64&nbsp;million in gains from portfolio hedging activities.Realized cash gains of $563&nbsp;million declined 45% from the previous yeardue to limited exit opportunities. Realized cash gains were recognizedacross all industries but were primarily harvested from investments inthe industrial and consumer sectors.JPMP's realized gains were more than offset by net write-offs (realizedlosses) and write-downs (unrealized losses) of $1.1&nbsp;billion. Thesewrite-downs and write-offs included $621&nbsp;million from the technology, mediaand telecommunications (&#147;TMT&#148;) sector, which continues to suffer from anindustry-wide contraction. JPMP also recorded unrealized losses of $210million from mark-to-market losses on its public portfolio, largely in TMT.JPMP's operating revenue also includes third-party management fees and netrevenue allocated to or from other JPMorgan Chase business segments.Investment pace, portfolio diversification and capital undermanagementIn 2002, increased emphasis was placed on leveraged buyouts and growthequity opportunities. JPMP's direct investment pace for the Firm's accountin 2002 was essentially flat with 2001 at $950&nbsp;million, with investmentactivity primarily related to buyouts.

Morgan Chase & Co./2002 AnnualReport&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.During 2002, several factors contributed to improved diversification. AtDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, the portfolio was $8.2&nbsp;billion, a reduction of $1.0&nbsp;billionfrom year-end 2001, primarily due to a decline in TMT investments. At the endof 2002, TMT investments were $1.5&nbsp;billion, or 18%, of the total portfolio,compared with $2.5&nbsp;billion, or 27%, of the portfolio at year-end 2001.Industrial growth investments have increased to 27% of the portfolio as ofDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, from 22% at the end of 2001, reflecting increasedinvestment in industrial buyout activity during 2002.At December&nbsp;31, 2002, JPMP's public securities portfolio was $520&nbsp;million, a48% decline from 2001 and less than one-sixth of the $3.4&nbsp;billion publicsecurities balance at December&nbsp;31, 1999. The 2002 decline resulted from lowermarket valuations and from accelerated sales of public securities that were notsubject to restrictions. These sales of public securities reduced the earningsvolatility created by this portfolio segment.Although 2002 reflected a reduction in the amount of publicly-heldsecurities in JPMP's portfolio, this portion of the portfolio couldincrease significantly, both in dollar amount and as a proportion of thetotal portfolio, due to changes in equity market prices and IPOopportunities available to portfolio companies.Currently, there are limited sales and financing activity in private equitymarkets, constraining realization opportunities.The Firm continues to regard JPMP as a strategic business that will createvalue over the long term. JPMP is seeking to reduce or exit selectedbusinesses and investments that are not central to its operations with thegoal that, over time, JPMP's private equity portfolio will be reduced fromapproximately 20% of the Firm's common stockholders' equity as of December31, 2002, to approximately 10%.JPMP's diversified private equity portfolio by industrygroup% of carrying value as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001Amounts above the bars represent the carrying values of theinvestments. &nbsp;Chase Financial ServicesChase Financial Services is a major provider of banking, investment andfinancing products and services to consumers and small and middle marketbusinesses throughout the United States.

It also serves as a full-service bank for consumers and small- andmedium-sized businesses through Chase Regional Banking (&#147;CRB&#148;) and ChaseMiddle Market (&#147;CMM&#148;).Selected financial databp- Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.Financial results overviewChase Financial Services (&#147;CFS&#148;) operating earnings increased 62% to a record$2.5&nbsp;billion in 2002. Shareholder value added almost tripled to $1.2&nbsp;billion,and return on common equity increased to 24% from 17% last year. Revenue growthof 24% reflected high business volumes across all consumer credit businessesand significant gains in Home Finance on the hedging of MSRs, partially offsetby the negative impact of lower interest rates on deposits. Expenses increased14% as a result of higher business volumes, partially offset by Six Sigma andother productivity efforts. The overhead ratio improved in 2002 to 47%, downfrom 51% in 2001. Credit costs increased, primarily due to higher averageloans.The Firm anticipates that CFS operating revenue and earnings will belower in 2003 due to reduced MSR hedging gains and the impact ofdeclining interest rates on its deposit businesses.Operating revenue exceeded $13.5&nbsp;billion in 2002, an increase of 24% from2001. The national consumer credit businesses drove the revenue increase.Home Finance revenues increased 73% over the prior year, driven by strongmortgage originations and gains on the hedging of MSRs. Credit card revenuesincreased 34% due to the Providian acquisition, lower funding costs andhigher purchase volume. Auto Finance revenues grew 26%, driven byoriginations of over $25&nbsp;billion and lower funding costs. Middle Marketrevenues increased 4%, driven by growth in average deposit volume and higherfees for deposit services; the low-interest rate environment reduced thevalue of customers' deposit balances and, consequently, increased depositfees. Regional Banking revenues declined 9% on lower deposit spreadsresulting from lower interest rates, partially offset by higher depositvolume.Operating expense rose 14% to $6.4&nbsp;billion. The increase reflects theacquisition of the Providian Master Trust, growth in consumer credit businessvolumes, higher incentive costs on better business results and higher creditcard marketing expenditures. Partially offsetting these increases were almost$250&nbsp;million in expense savings achieved through Six Sigma and otherproductivity efforts. The overhead ratio improved to 47% from 51% a year ago,as a result of both revenue increases and expense initiatives.Credit costs, on a managed basis, increased 10%, driven by a 23% increasein credit card receivables, including the Providian portfolio. Creditquality of the card portfolio remained relatively stable, the result ofproactive credit risk management and enhanced collections initiatives. CFSincreased its allowance for credit losses in 2002 by $233&nbsp;million,primarily due to the Providian acquisition. Higher securitizations,however, mitigated the increase in the allowance. For a further discussionof the consumer credit portfolio, see pages 54-55. &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Chase Financial Services' businessesChase Home FinanceCHF is the fourth-largest mortgage originator and the fourth-largest mortgageservicer in the United States, with more than 4&nbsp;million customers. In 2002,CHF capitalized on a record year for the U.S. mortgage industry ashistorically low interest rates contributed to higher production volumes andfavorable margins. CHF experienced its own record year, with total revenuesand operating earnings increasing 73% and 136%, respectively, demonstratingCHF's strength in both origination and servicing.During 2002, CHF successfully shifted its origination growth intohigher-margin business sectors. Loan originations in these higher-marginsectors (i.e., retail, wholesale, telephone-based and e-commerce)contributed to a record $113&nbsp;billion in origination volume, an increase of30% over 2001. As part of this increase in origination volume during 2002,home equity, a strategic growth area, rose 52% to $14&nbsp;billion. CHF'scorrespondent-negotiated business, a lower-margin sector, was down 56% to$43&nbsp;billion, due to pricing and market conditions. Low interest rates alsocontributed to the increase in revenue through improved net interestmargins. In 2003, CHF will continue its initiatives to retain customersconsidered likely to refinance.In mortgage servicing, lower interest rates led to high prepayment levels,which resulted in the accelerated amortization and impairment of MSRs. In2002, CHF partnered with the Firm's Global Treasury Group to manage theinterest rate sensitivity of MSRs. Global Treasury managed the riskexposure of the MSRs through a series of derivatives (e.g., a combinationof swaps, swaptions and floors) and AFS securities that increased in valuewhen interest rates declined. During 2002, MSR valuation adjustments of$4.1&nbsp;billion were more than offset by $4.7&nbsp;billion in gains on derivatives,realized gains from sales of AFS securities and net interest earned on AFSsecurities. The net positive result of $582&nbsp;million was an increase of $838million over 2001, driven by wider mortgage-swap spreads and a fallinginterest rate environment. Management anticipates an eventual decrease inthis revenue category, as mortgage-swap spreads and interest rates revertto normal levels. The carrying value of MSRs also declined $1.4&nbsp;billion asa result of periodic amortization, $244&nbsp;million more than in 2001. For afurther discussion of MSR activities, see Note 12 on pages 87&#150;88.Operating expense increased 28% on the growth in origination volume and avery high level of loan servicing activity, partially offset by gains inproductivity and benefits realized from Six Sigma initiatives.

Operating earnings for 2002 were a record$716&nbsp;million, 44% greater than 2001. The primary drivers were theacquisition of the Providian portfolio and overall higher revenue. Theseresults were achieved in a highly competitive market environment and a weakU.S. economy. Industry challenges included competitive pricing, increasedcompetition for new accounts, depressed response rates to credit cardsolicitations as costs to acquire new accounts increased, and decliningacceptances to balance consolidation offers.Total operating revenue increased 34%, reflecting receivables growth, lowerfunding costs, higher late fees, an increase in interchange revenue due tohigher purchase volumes and successful sales of fee-based products. Excludingthe Providian portfolio, operating revenues increased 12%. Operating expensesincreased 33%; excluding Providian, operating expenses increased 14%, drivenby higher volumes and an increase in marketing expenditures, which enabledCCS to maintain a consistent level of new cardmember acquisitions amid acompetitive market environment. Total accounts increased 22%, reflecting theaddition of 3.7&nbsp;million new accounts, as well as accounts related to theProvidian acquisition. Total volume (purchases, cash advances and balancetransfers) increased 16% to a record $84&nbsp;billion. Managed credit card-relatedreceivables increased 23% to $51.1&nbsp;billion.Note: The above metrics include other consumer loans.The managed credit card-related net charge-off ratio was 5.89%, an increaseof 40 basis points from 2001. This increase partly reflects the inclusionof the Providian portfolio. Excluding the Providian portfolio, this ratiowas 5.66%, an increase of 17 basis points from 2001.

Operating earnings grew 41% to $180&nbsp;million. These results reflectedhigher revenue on increases in average loan and lease receivables andlower funding costs, offset by higher operating expenses and higher creditcosts driven by loan volumes.In 2002, CAF's operating revenues grew 26% to $696&nbsp;million. Its marketshare among auto finance companies improved from 4.1% in 2001 to 5.7% in2002, the result of strong organic growth and an origination strategy thatallies the business with manufacturers and dealers. CAF relationships withseveral major car manufacturers contributed to 2002 growth, as did CAF'sdealer relationships, which increased from approximately 12,200 dealers in2001 to approximately 12,700 dealers in 2002.

In addition, Brown & Co.,the specialty online brokerage unit, was transferred to IMPB. Prior-periodamounts have been adjusted for the Brown & Co. transfer.CRB had operating earnings of $399&nbsp;million in 2002, down 15% from 2001. Thedecrease was attributable to 9% lower revenue, predominantly driven bylower interest rates, which compressed spreads on deposits.

Product offerings include cash management, credit, corporatefinance, international banking services and various credit products, such asleasing and asset-backed financing. CMM is organized around geographies,industries and products to deliver greater value to customers. CMM's 2002 and2001 results included 100% of the revenues and expenses attributed to theshared activities with Treasury Services. See page 25 for a discussion of theFirm's revenue- and expense-sharing agreements between business segments.CMM's operating earnings increased 22% compared with the prior year, theresult of deposit volume growth, increased fees for deposit services, expensediscipline and a reduction in credit costs. Lower interest rates reduced thevalue of customer deposit balances and, consequently, increased the fees paidby customers for deposit services. The lower credit costs reflect reducedcharge-offs and improving credit quality. The overhead ratio improved to 55%,compared with 57% last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Support Units and CorporateSelected financial dataNote: Amounts are shown in place of % changes.The Support Units and Corporate sector includes Enterprise TechnologyServices (&#147;ETS&#148;), Corporate Business Services (&#147;CBS&#148;), legal, audit,corporate finance, human resources, risk management, executivemanagement and corporate marketing.Support Units and Corporate reflects the accounting effects remaining atthe corporate level after the application of the Firm's managementaccounting policies. These policies allocate the costs associated withtechnology, operational and staff support services to the businesssegments. The residual component of the allowance for credit losses is notallocated to the business segments.ETS is an internal technology service organization, and CBS manages the Firm'ssupport services, including real estate management, human resources and financeoperations and procurement. ETS and CBS seek to provide services to the Firm'sbusinesses that are competitive with comparable third-party providers in termsof price and service quality. These units leverage the Firm's global scale andtechnology to gain efficiencies through consolidation, standardization, vendormanagement and outsourcing.In December 2002, JPMorgan Chase entered into a seven-year agreement withIBM to outsource portions of the Firm's internal technology infrastructureservices. This agreement will enable the Firm to transform its technologyinfrastructure through absolute cost savings, increased cost variability,access to the best research and innovation and improved service levels. Bymoving from a traditional fixed-cost approach to one with increasedcapacity and cost variability, the Firm expects to be able to respond morequickly to changing market conditions. The impact on expenses as a resultof this agreement is expected to be minimal in 2003.For 2002, Support Units and Corporate had an operating loss of $743&nbsp;million,compared with a loss of $649&nbsp;million in 2001. This sector usually operates ata moderate loss. Negative operating revenue usually results from theapplication of the Firm's transfer pricing policies and the overallocation ofcapital to the various business segments. Expense items usually result fromtiming differences in allocations to other business sectors and residualsfrom interoffice allocation among the business segments. Income tax benefitreflects the difference between the aggregate recorded at the consolidatedlevel and the amount recorded at the business segments. Included in 2002operating expense was a $120&nbsp;million reversal of previously accrued expenses;these were associated with forfeitable stock-based compensation awards issuedunder employee benefit plans that contained stock price targets that weredeemed unlikely to be attained within the timeframes specified under theterms of the awards.In 2002, credit costs in excess of net charge-offs not allocated to thesegments were $133&nbsp;million, compared with $167&nbsp;million of such costs in2001. Although the Support Units and Corporate sector has no traditionalcredit assets, the residual component of the allowance for credit lossesis maintained at the corporate level and is not allocated to any specificbusiness segment. For a further discussion of the residual component, seepage 56.Included in the 2001 operating losses of $649&nbsp;million was a pretax loss of$152&nbsp;million at LabMorgan, resulting from the write-downs of investmentsand equity accounting losses. LabMorgan was restructured in 2001, and itsremaining investment portfolio of $49&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2002, ismanaged by JPMorgan Partners.The negative capital position of $1.8&nbsp;billion in Support Units andCorporate results from an overallocation of economic capital to thebusinesses as compared with available common stockholders' equity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Risk and Capital managementRisk management at JPMorgan Chase is guided by several principles, including:Risk management and oversight beginswith the Risk Policy Committee of the Board of Directors, which reviews the governanceof these activities, delegating the formulation of policy andday-today risk oversight and management to the Executive Committeeand to the two corporate risk committees: Capital and RiskManagement.The Executive Committee provides guidance regardingstrategies and risk appetite and is responsible for anintegrated view of risk exposures, including theinterdependencies among JPMorgan Chase's various riskcategories.The Capital Committee focuses on Firm-wide capital planning, internalcapital allocation and liquidity management. The Risk ManagementCommittee focuses on credit risk, market risk, operational risk,private equity risk and fiduciary risk. Both risk committees havedecision-making authority, with major policy decisions and riskexposures subject to review by the Executive Committee.In addition to the Risk Policy Committee, the Audit Committee of the Boardof Directors is responsible for discussion of guidelines and policies togovern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken.In addition, the Audit Committee reviews with management the system ofinternal controls and financial reporting that is relied upon to providereasonable assurance of compliance with the Firm's operational riskmanagement processes.The Firm's use of SVA, which incorporates a risk-adjusted capital methodologyas its primary performance measure, has strengthened its risk managementdiscipline by charging the businesses the cost of capital linked to the risksassociated with their respective activities.For a discussion of capital allocation methodologies, see the respectiverisk management sections on pages 45-65.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Capital and Liquidity managementCapital managementJPMorgan Chase's capital management framework helps to optimize the use of capital by:Available versus required capitalEconomic risk capital: JPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy utilizinginternal risk assessment methodologies. The Firm assigns economic capitalbased primarily on four risk factors. The methodology quantifies credit,market and operating risk for each business and, for JPMP, private equityrisk, and assigns capital accordingly. These methodologies are discussed inthe risk management sections of this Annual Report.Capital also is assessed against business units for certain nonriskfactors. Businesses are assessed capital equal to 100% of any goodwill and50% for certain other intangibles generated through acquisitions.Additionally, JPMorgan Chase assesses an &#147;asset capital tax&#148; againstmanaged assets and some off-balance sheet instruments. These assessmentsrecognize that certain minimum regulatory capital ratios must bemaintained by the Firm. JPMorgan Chase also estimates the portfolio effecton required economic capital based on correlations of risk in stressscenarios across risk categories. This estimated diversification benefitleads to a reduction in required economic capital for the Firm.The total required economic capital for JPMorgan Chase as determined byits models and after considering the Firm's estimated diversificationbenefits is then compared with available common stockholders' equity toevaluate overall capital utilization. The Firm's policy is to maintain anappropriate level of excess capital to provide for growth and additionalprotection against losses.The 2002 excess capital position was slightly higher than in 2001. Theincrease was primarily due to a decline in private equity risk capitaldue to the lower carrying value of the portfolio, partially offset byincreases in credit risk capital and goodwill/intangibles capital atChase Financial Services, principally as a result of the acquisition ofthe Providian Master Trust.Internal capital allocations may change from time to time to reflectrefinements of economic capital methodologies. For 2003, the Firm isrevising its capital measurement methodologies for commercial credit riskand operating risk. These changes are discussed on pages 57 and 64.Regulatory capital: JPMorgan Chase's primary federal banking regulator, theBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;),establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards andleverage ratios, for the consolidated financial holding company and itsstate-chartered banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank. The Office of theComptroller of the Currency establishes similar capital requirements andstandards for the Firm's national bank subsidiaries, including ChaseManhattan Bank USA, N.A. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, the financial holdingcompany and its banking subsidiaries maintained capital levels well inexcess of the minimum capital requirements.Currently, the Firm targets a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% to 8.25%. TheCapital Committee reviews the Firm's capital targets and policies regularlyin light of changing economic conditions and business needs. Additionalinformation regarding the Firm's capital ratios and a more detaileddiscussion of federal regulatory capital standards are presented in Note 26on pages 99 and 100.Dividends: Dividends declared in any quarter will be determined by JPMorganChase's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors expressed its intent, onSeptember&nbsp;17, 2002, to continue the current dividend level, provided thatcapital ratios remain strong and earnings prospects exceed the currentdividend.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Liquidity managementIn managing liquidity, management considers a variety of liquidity riskmeasures as well as market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidityneeds and the desired maturity profile of its liabilities.OverviewLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Firm'sactivities and in the management of its assets and liabilities. JPMorganChase recognizes the importance of sound liquidity management as a keyfactor in maintaining strong credit ratings and utilizes a liquidityframework intended to maximize liquidity access and minimize fundingcosts. Active liquidity management seeks to ensure that the Firm will beable to replace maturing obligations when due and fund its assets atappropriate maturities and rates in all market environments.Liquidity management frameworkThe Capital Committee sets the overall liquidity policy for the Firm andreviews the contingency funding plan. In addition, the Capital Committeeprovides oversight of the Firm's exposure to special-purpose entities(&#147;SPEs&#148;), with particular focus on potential liquidity support requirementsthat the Firm may have to those SPEs. The Liquidity Risk Committee,reporting to the Capital Committee, meets monthly to identify and monitorliquidity issues, provide policy guidance, oversee adherence and maintainan evolving contingency plan.JPMorgan Chase utilizes liquidity monitoring tools to maintain appropriatelevels of liquidity through normal and stress periods. The Firm's liquidityanalytics rely on management's judgment about JPMorgan Chase's ability toliquidate assets or use them as collateral for borrowings. These analyticsalso involve estimates and assumptions, taking into account credit riskmanagement's historical data on the funding of loan commitments (e.g.,commercial paper back-up facilities), liquidity commitments to SPEs,commitments with rating triggers and collateral-posting requirements. For afurther discussion on SPEs and other off-balance sheet arrangements, seeOff-balance sheet arrangements on page 44 as well as Note 11 on pages83&#150;87.The Firm's three primary measures of liquidity are:Each of the Firm's liquidity surplus positions, as of December&nbsp;31, 2002,indicates that JPMorgan Chase's long-dated funding, including core deposits,exceeds illiquid assets and that the Firm's obligations can be met if access tofunding is temporarily impaired.An extension of the Firm's ongoing liquidity management is its contingencyfunding plan, which is intended to help the Firm manage through liquiditystress periods. The plan considers temporary and long-term stress scenariosand forecasts potential funding needs where access to unsecured funding isseverely limited or nonexistent. These scenarios take into account both on-and off-balance sheet exposures, evaluating access to funds by the parentholding company, JPMorgan Chase Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A.,separately.FundingCredit ratings: JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorgan ChaseBank's credit ratings as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, were as follows:As of February&nbsp;28, 2003, the ratings outlook for the parent holding companyby Moody's Investor Services (&#147;Moody's&#148;) was stable, and the ratingsoutlook for the parent holding company by Standard & Poor's (&#147;S&P&#148;) andFitch, Inc. (&#147;Fitch&#148;) was negative.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by creditratings. During 2002, S&P, Moody's and Fitch lowered the debt ratings ofJPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and its subsidiaries one notch tothe levels noted above. This resulted in an increase in the marginal cost oflong-term wholesale funds to the parent holding company. JPMorgan ChaseBank's cost of short-term funds has not been materially affected by thedowngrade, although certain counterparties and investors have reduced limitsand maturities of exposure to the Firm as a result of these actions. Thefinancial impact of the ratings downgrade on the Firm has not been material.See page 44, 52 and Note 11 on page 86 for further information about theimplications of a ratings downgrade for the Firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Balance sheet: The Firm's total assets increased to $759&nbsp;billion atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, from $694&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001. Auto financingand residential consumer loans increased on higher originations, offset byincreased loan securitizations; commercial loans declined, reflectingweaker loan demand and the Firm's ongoing efforts to reduce commercialexposures. Increases in debt and equity trading assets and investmentsecurity assets were driven by increased trading and hedging activity.Derivative receivables increased primarily as a result of the decline ininterest rates. Growth in trading assets and investment securities wasfinanced primarily by increases in repurchase agreements, tradingliabilities and deposits.Sources of funds: The diversity of the Firm's funding sources enhancesflexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds, whileminimizing the cost of funds. JPMorgan Chase has access to funding marketsacross the globe and leverages a broad investor base. Liquidity isgenerated using a variety of both short-term and long-term instruments,including deposits, federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements,commercial paper, bank notes, medium- and long-term debt, capitalsecurities and stockholders' equity. During the year, the Firm extended itsliability maturity profile while reducing reliance on shorter-datedwholesale funding instruments (e.g., federal funds purchased and commercialpaper). A major source of liquidity for JPMorgan Chase Bank is provided byits large core deposit base. Core deposits include all U.S. deposits,except noninterest-bearing time deposits and certificates of deposit of$100,000 or more. In addition to core deposits, the Firm benefits fromsubstantial, stable deposit balances originated by T&SS through the normalcourse of its business.Additional funding flexibility is provided by the Firm's ability to accessthe repurchase and asset securitization markets. These alternatives areevaluated on an ongoing basis to achieve the appropriate balance of securedand unsecured funding. The ability to securitize loans, and the associatedgains on those securitizations, are principally dependent on the creditquality and yields on the assets securitized and are generally notdependent on the ratings of the issuing entity. Transactions between theFirm and its securitization structures are reflected in JPMorgan Chase'sfinancial statements; these relationships include retained interests insecuritization trusts, derivative transactions and liquidity facilities.For further details, see Notes 11 and 29.Issuance: Corporate credit spreads widened in 2002 across industries andsectors, driven by headline risk, increased investment-grade defaults andinvestor risk aversion. JPMorgan Chase's credit spreads increased relativeto peer commercial bank spreads but remained comparable with peer investmentbank spreads.Consistent with the policy discussed earlier in this section, the Firmmaintains funding at the holding company sufficient to cover maturingobligations over the next 12&nbsp;months, which requires periodic issuance oflong-term debt and capital. The Firm raised the majority of its liquidityneeds earlier in the year before the increase in cost of funding occurred.The Firm believes that the financial impact from the increased cost oflong-term debt to be raised in 2003 will not be material.During 2002, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $11&nbsp;billion of long-termdebt and $1&nbsp;billion of trust preferred capital securities. During the year,$12.2&nbsp;billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed, and $550&nbsp;million ofpreferred stock of subsidiary was redeemed. In addition, the Firmsecuritized approximately $7.2&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans, $9.4billion of credit card loans and $3.4&nbsp;billion of auto loans, resulting inpre-tax gains on securitizations of $214&nbsp;million, $45&nbsp;million and $6million, respectively. For a further discussion of loan securitizations, seeNote 11 on pages 83-87.Derivatives are used in liquidity risk management and funding to achieve theFirm's desired interest rate risk profile. The Firm enters into derivativescontracts to swap fixed-rate debt to floating-rate obligations and to swapfloating-rate debt to fixed-rate obligations. Derivatives contracts are alsoused to hedge the variability in interest rates that arises from otherfloating-rate financial instruments and forecasted transactions, such as therollover of short-term assets and liabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Off-balance sheet arrangementsSpecial-purpose entities or special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;) are animportant part of the financial markets, providing market liquidity byfacilitating investors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks.SPEs are not operating entities; typically they are set up for a single,discrete purpose, have a limited life, and have no employees. The basic SPEstructure involves a company selling assets to the SPE. The SPE funds thepurchase by selling securities to investors. To insulate investors fromcreditors of other entities, including the seller of the assets, SPEs canbe structured to be bankruptcy-remote. They are critical to the functioningof many investor markets, including, for example, the market formortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and commercial paper.JPMorgan Chase is involved with SPEs in three broad categories oftransactions: loan securitizations, multi-seller conduits, and clientintermediation. Capital is held, as appropriate, against all SPE-relatedtransactions and exposures such as derivative transactions and lendingcommitments.The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support an SPEtransaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs beconducted at arms' length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with thispolicy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs withwhich the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm'sWorldwide Rules of Conduct. These rules prohibit employees fromself-dealing and prohibit employees from acting on behalf of the Firm intransactions with which they or their family have any significant financialinterest. For a further discussion of SPEs and the Firm's accounting forSPEs, see Note 11 on pages 83-87.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required toprovide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgradedbelow specific levels, primarily A-1, P-1 and F-1. The amount of theseliquidity commitments was $48.6&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002; $35.5&nbsp;billionrelate to the Firm's multi-seller conduits and structured commercial loanvehicles further described in Note 11 on page 86. The total commercialpaper outstanding for the multi-seller conduits and structured commercialloan vehicles was $24.7&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. The remaining $13.1billion in commitments relate to vehicles established by third parties. IfJPMorgan Chase Bank is required to provide funding under these commitments,the Firm could be replaced as liquidity provider. Additionally, for themulti-seller conduits and the structured commercial loan vehicles, JPMorganChase Bank could facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets in theSPE. All of these commitments are included in the Firm's total $196.7billion in other unfunded commitments to extend credit, described in moredetail in Note 29 on pages 102 and 103.The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase's contractual cash obligationsand off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments by remainingmaturity at December&nbsp;31, 2002:For further information about off-balance sheet lending-related financialinstruments, see Note 29 on pages 102 and 103.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Credit risk managementCredit risk is the risk of loss due to obligor or counterparty default.This risk is managed at both the transaction and portfolio levels. Creditrisk management practices are designed to preserve the independence andintegrity of the risk assessment process.Credit riskCredit risk represents the loss the Firm would experience if an obligoror counterparty could not meet its contractual obligations. The Firm issubject to credit risk in its lending (e.g., loans and lending-relatedcommitments) and in its derivatives and certain other trading activities.The credit risk related to the issuers of the securities used in theFirm's capital market activities is marked-to-market, measured andmanaged through the Firm's market risk management process.The credit risks of the consumer and commercial portfolios are markedlydifferent. Broadly speaking, losses on consumer exposures are morepredictable, less volatile and less cyclical than losses on commercialexposures. For the commercial portfolio, the actual loss volatility canbe much greater over the course of an economic cycle.Credit risk management practicesCredit risk management begins with an assessment of the likelihood ofdefault and the risk of loss that could result from an obligor orcounterparty default. The Firm seeks to assess all credit exposures,whether on- or off-balance sheet. These exposures include loans,derivative receivables and lending-related commitments (e.g., letters ofcredit and undrawn commitments to extend credit). At both the businessunit and corporate levels, processes in place are intended to ensure thatcredit risks are accurately assessed, properly approved, continuallymonitored and actively managed.To measure these risks, estimates are made of both expected and unexpectedlosses for each segment of the portfolio using statistical techniques.First, off-balance sheet exposures are converted to &#147;on-balance sheet loanequivalent amounts,&#148; based on the amount expected to be drawn at the timeof default. Then expected and unexpected losses are calculated. Expectedlosses are statistically-based estimates of credit losses over time,anticipated as a result of counterparty default. Expected losses are usedto set risk-adjusted credit loss provisions. However, expected creditlosses are not the sole indicators of risk. For commercial assets, iflosses were entirely predictable, the expected loss rate could be factoredinto pricing and covered as a normal and recurring cost of doing business.Unexpected losses represent the potential volatility of actual lossesrelative to the expected level of loss. Unexpected losses are what createrisk and represent the primary focus of credit risk management.The responsibility for credit risk management resides with two functionsthat were integrated in early 2003: Credit Risk Policy and Global CreditManagement. Both are now headed by the Senior Credit Officer who, in turn,reports to the Vice Chairman for Finance, Risk Management andAdministration.Credit Risk Policy formulates credit policies, limits, allowance adequacyand guidelines. Independently from the groups that approve and support theFirm's credit activities, this group monitors and assesses risk profiles andrisk management processes at multiple levels &#151; individual credits, industrygroups, product groups and entire business segments of the Firm. Credit RiskPolicy is also responsible for managing problem credits. Credit Risk Policyworks jointly with Market Risk Management to address country risk,counterparty risk, risk measurement and capital allocation methodologies.Global Credit Management has three functions: Credit Risk Management,Corporate Banking and the Credit Portfolio Group. The first two functionsparticipate in client coverage and are responsible for approving andmonitoring all credit exposures. Experienced credit officers make decisionsto extend credit based on an evaluation of the counterparty'screditworthiness and the type of credit arrangement. These officers considerthe current and projected financial condition of the counterparty. Alsoconsidered are the covenants, collateral and protection available should thecredit quality of the counterparty deteriorate. After credit is extended,credit officers and industry analysts, in collaboration with senior businessmanagers, monitor the counterparty's credit quality. In addition to ongoingreview of counterparty financial data and documentation, the Credit RiskManagement and Corporate Banking groups manage the formal client- andindustry-based portfolio review processes. Senior credit officers regularlyreview current and potential exposure and compliance with limits on bothindividual counterparties and portfolios. The Credit Portfolio Group managesthe Firm's credit exposures resulting from both traditional lending andderivative trading activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Credit portfolioJPMorgan Chase's managed credit-related assets (including $30.7&nbsp;billion ofsecuritized credit cards) totaled $330&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, anincrease of 7% over year-end 2001. The growth reflects a 16% increase inmanaged consumer loans, offset by a 13% decline in commercial loans, and a 17% increase in derivativereceivables. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, managed consumer loans represented 47% oftotal managed credit-related assets, compared with 43% at December&nbsp;31, 2001.The following table presents a summary of managed credit-related informationfor the dates indicated:NA-Not applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Commercial portfolioManagement of commercial credit risk begins with the individual clientselection and evaluation process. The Firm monitors and evaluates industry riskprofiles globally. Exposures in industries deemed to have increasing risk aremore closely managed, both individually and in the aggregate. The Firm's globalstrategy, particularly in emerging markets, is to focus on large, leading firmswith cross-border financing needs.Concentration management continues to be key in managing commercial creditrisk. From the perspective of aggregate portfolio risk management,concentration management is addressed partly by the Firm's established strategyof loan origination for distribution, and partly by the purchase of creditprotection through credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales. The Firmmanages concentrations by obligor, risk rating, industry, product andgeography. As a result of a particularly difficult credit environment in 2002,the Firm placed increased emphasis on the management and further reduction ofindustry and single-name concentrations. The Firm established an exposure andcapital threshold review process for single-name concentrations and enhancedits procedures to reduce single-name and industry concentrations. The Firm willcontinue to refine these credit risk management processes in 2003.The Firm's business strategy for its commercial portfolio remains one oforigination for distribution, primarily for large corporate obligors. Themajority of the Firm's wholesale loan originations in IB continue to bedistributed into the marketplace, with residual holds by the Firm averagingless than 10%. The commercial loan portfolio declined 13% in 2002, reflecting acombination of continued weak loan demand and charge-offs, as well as theFirm's ongoing goal of reducing commercial credit exposure. In addition, theFirm's SVA discipline discourages the retention of loan assets that do notgenerate a positive return above the cost of risk-adjusted capital. SVA remainsa critical discipline in making loans and commitments, particularly whencombined with other credit and capital management disciplines.Markets for traditional credit products have become more liquid, with increasedopportunities for risk management using credit derivatives and secondary marketloan sales. The Firm will begin in 2003 to derive more of its assessment ofcredit risk capital from these market-based parameters which will, in turn,affect SVA. See the discussion on capital allocation on page 57.Total commercial exposure (loans, derivatives and unfunded lending-relatedcommitments) was $413&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, compared with $424&nbsp;billionat December&nbsp;31, 2001. At year-end 2002, 80% of the Firm's commercial creditexposure was considered investment-grade; only 1% of the total commercialcredit exposure was nonperforming. This compares with 77% investment-gradeexposure at year-end 2001; 0.8% of the total commercial credit exposure wasnonperforming at that date.Total commercial nonperforming assets were $4.1&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002which included $337&nbsp;million related to Enron. This represented an increase of$772&nbsp;million from year-end 2001 and equaled 2% of the total commercialcredit-related assets. The increase in nonperforming assets in 2002 was largelydriven by loans in the telecommunications and related, cable and merchantenergy and related sectors. Nonperforming assets related to Enron declined by$936&nbsp;million, primarily as a result of the settlement of the Firm's litigationwith the surety providers.Commercial loan net charge-offs in 2002 were $1.9&nbsp;billion, compared with $1.0billion in 2001. Charge-offs of commercial lending-related commitments were$212&nbsp;million in 2002, compared with a net recovery of $3&nbsp;million in 2001. Thecharge-off ratio for commercial loans was 1.93% in 2002 and 0.87% in 2001.While the economic and associated credit environments are expected to remainchallenging in 2003, the Firm does not anticipate commercial charge-offs in2003 to reach 2002 levels.Below are summaries of the maturity and risk profiles of the commercialportfolio as of December&nbsp;31, 2002. The ratings scale is based on the Firm'sinternal risk ratings and is presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.Commercial exposure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Commercial exposure &#151; selected industry concentrationsThe Firm remains highly focused on diversifying its commercial exposure. Thefollowing table sets forth certain information related to the Firm's commercialcredit exposure (loans, derivatives and lending-related commitments):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Selected industry discussion&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Exposures deemed criticized generally represent a risk profile similar to arating of CCC&#043;/Caa1 or lower. Of the total $16.6&nbsp;billion in criticized exposureas of year-end 2002, representing 4% of total commercial credit exposure, $4.1billion was non-performing. The telecom and related, cable and merchant energyand related sectors represented, in the aggregate, $6.8&nbsp;billion, or 41%, oftotal criticized exposure, but only 1.6% of total commercial credit exposure.The balance of the criticized exposure represented exposures diversified acrossa large number of customers, with limited industry concentration.Enron-related exposureThe Firm's exposure to Enron and Enron-related entities was reduced by $1.38billion during 2002, from $2.06&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001 to $688&nbsp;million atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. In January 2003, the Firm settled its surety-bond litigationwith 11 insurance companies for 60% of the principal amount of the bonds andreceived a cash payment of $502&nbsp;million and unsecured claims valued at $75million (or 13% of face value). In connection with the settlement, the Firmcharged off an aggregate $395&nbsp;million relating to the remaining exposure on theprepaid forward contracts and on a prepaid forward contract that is backed by aletter of credit that is the subject of continuing litigation. The Firm hasreclassified the remaining value of the derivative contracts covered by thesurety bonds and the $75&nbsp;million in unsecured claims as Trading assets. Inaddition to these write-downs and charge-offs, during 2002, $76&nbsp;million ofother Enron-related exposure was charged-off or written-down and $402&nbsp;millionof Enron-related assets were sold or matured, including $125&nbsp;million ofdebtor-in-possession financing exposure which matured without being drawn.At December&nbsp;31, 2002, the Firm's Enron-related exposure was as follows:Enron-related exposure (a)Of the $131&nbsp;million in lending-related commitments, $125&nbsp;million relates todebtor-in-possession financing. The $108&nbsp;million in Other assets relates to theEnron-related letter of credit that is the subject of litigation. Tradingassets (both performing and nonperforming) are carried at fair value. Securedloans are performing and are reported on an amortized cost basis. All unsecuredamounts are nonperforming; nonperforming loans have been written down toreflect management's estimate of current recoverable value, and nonperformingother assets are being carried at their current estimated realizable value inaccordance with SFAS 5.Derivative contractsIn the normal course of business, the Firm utilizes derivative instruments tomeet the needs of customers, generate revenues through trading activities,manage exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates and manage itsown credit risk. The Firm uses the same credit risk management procedures toassess and approve potential credit exposures when entering into derivativetransactions as those used for traditional lending.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and derivativereceivables (i.e., the mark-to-market or fair value of the derivative contractafter taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the dates indicated:Notional amounts and derivative receivables&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The $26 trillion of notional principal of the Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2002, significantly exceeds the possible creditlosses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivativetransactions, the notional principal amount does not change hands; it is simplyused as a reference to calculate payments. In terms of current credit riskexposure, the appropriate measure of risk is the mark-to-market (&#147;MTM&#148;) valueof the contract. The MTM exposure represents the cost to replace the contractsat current market rates should the counterparty default. When JPMorgan Chasehas more than one transaction outstanding with a counterparty, and a legallyenforceable master netting agreement exists with the counterparty, the net MTMexposure, less collateral held, represents, in the Firm's view, the appropriatemeasure of current credit risk with that counterparty as of the reporting date.At December&nbsp;31, 2002, the MTM value of derivatives receivables (after takinginto account the effects of master netting agreements) was $83&nbsp;billion.Further, after taking into account $30&nbsp;billion of collateral held by the Firm,the net current credit exposure was $53&nbsp;billion.While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net MTM value of thederivatives receivable does not capture the potential future variability ofthat credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of creditexposure, the Firm measures, on a client-by-client basis, both the worst-case,or peak, future credit risk (at a 97.5% confidence level), as well as theexpected credit risk. However, the total potential future credit risk embeddedin the Firm's derivatives portfolio is not the simple sum of all peak orexpected client credit risks. This is because, at the portfolio level, creditrisk is reduced by the fact that when offsetting transactions are done withseparate counterparties, only one of the two trades can generate a credit losseven if both counterparties were to default simultaneously. The Firm refers tothis effect as market diversification.The Firm defines the &#147;market-diversified peak&#148; as the maximum loss (estimatedat the 97.5% confidence level) that would occur if all counterparties were todefault over a one-year time horizon without any recovery. Themarket-diversified peak, after taking into account both collateral and netting,was approximately $57&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. Since, generally, allcounterparties will not default at once nor all default when their exposuresare at peak levels, this is a conservative measure, in the Firm's view, of itspotential future derivatives credit risk.The MTM value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment toreflect the credit quality of counterparties. This is called the CreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;) and was $1.3&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2002,compared with $1.2&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001. The CVA is based on theexpected future exposure (incorporating netting and collateral) to acounterparty, and on the counterparty's credit spread in the credit derivativesmarket. The primary components of changes in CVA are credit spreads, new dealactivity, deal unwinds and changes in the interest rate, equity, foreignexchange or commodity environment. The CVA increase in 2002 was primarily dueto derivative receivables, which increased as a result of a drop in U.S.interest rates, increased interest rate volatility and widening of creditspreads during the year.The Firm believes that dynamic risk management is essential to controlling thecredit risk in the derivatives portfolio. The Firm hedges components of the CVAchange by entering into credit derivative transactions as well as interestrate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivatives transactions whenclient deals are originated. These hedges are rebalanced as market conditionsdictate, driven primarily by changes in the counterparties' credit quality. Ifcounterparty credit risk increases, the CVA increases to reflect the increasedlikelihood that the client will not perform. Correspondingly, the requiredmarket hedges to protect against subsequent credit-quality deteriorationincrease. The net impact of the change in CVA, plus the result of all forms ofrelated hedging activity, is accounted for in Trading revenue and was notmaterial to the overall trading results of the Firm for the year.At December&nbsp;31, 2002, 52% of the Firm's counterparties in derivativetransactions were investment-grade financial institutions, most of which aredealers in these products. The investment-grade portion of the derivativereceivables was 87% at December&nbsp;31, 2002. Nonperforming derivative receivablesat December&nbsp;31, 2002, were $289&nbsp;million, compared with $1.3&nbsp;billion at December31, 2001. This decrease of $1.0&nbsp;billion primarily related to the settlement ofthe Enron surety litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.The table below summarizes the risk profile, as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, of theFirm's balance sheet exposure to derivative contracts, net of cash and otherhighly liquid collateral:Approximately two-thirds of the Firm's derivatives transactions have associatedcollateral agreements, and collateralization as a primary form of credit riskmitigation continues to increase. The Firm held $30&nbsp;billion of collateral as ofDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, compared with $20&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2001. The Firmposted $19&nbsp;billion of collateral at year-end 2002, compared with $11&nbsp;billion atthe end of 2001. The increases were driven largely by the drop in U.S. interestrates and by new collateral agreements. In addition, derivative and collateralagreements include provisions that require both the Firm and the counterparty,upon specified downgrades in their respective credit ratings, to postcollateral for the benefit of the other party. The impact on requiredcollateral of a single-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank from itscurrent rating of AA- to A&#043; would have been an additional $1.2&nbsp;billion ofcollateral as of December&nbsp;31, 2002. The impact of a six-notch ratings downgradeto JPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- to BBB-) would have been $3.7&nbsp;billion ofadditional collateral from current levels as of December&nbsp;31, 2002. The amountof additional collateral required upon downgrade moves in tandem with themark-to-market value of the derivatives portfolio and ranged from $2.6&nbsp;billionto $3.8&nbsp;billion through 2002 (related to a six-notch downgrade), as the levelof U.S. interest rates changed. Moreover, certain derivatives contracts also provide for termination of thecontract, generally upon JPMorgan Chase Bank being downgraded, at thethen-existing mark-to-market value of the derivative receivables.Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the notional amounts of credit derivativesprotection bought and sold at December&nbsp;31, 2002:Credit derivatives activityJPMorgan Chase has limited counterparty exposure as a result of creditderivatives transactions. Of the $83&nbsp;billion of total derivative receivables atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, approximately $5.5&nbsp;billion, or 7%, was associated withcredit derivatives, before the benefit of collateral. The use of derivatives tomanage exposures does not reduce the reported level of assets on the balancesheet or the level of reported off-balance sheet commitments.Portfolio management activityJPMorgan Chase's commercial credit portfolio is composed of credit exposures toclients arising from both lending and derivatives activities. In managing thisportfolio, single-name and portfolio credit derivatives are purchased by theCredit Portfolio Group to hedge these exposures. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, thenotional outstanding of protection purchased via single-name and portfoliocredit derivatives was $24&nbsp;billion and $10&nbsp;billion, respectively. The Firm alsodiversifies its exposures by providing (i.e., selling) small amounts of creditprotection, which increases exposure to industries or clients where the Firmhas little or no client-related exposure. This activity is not material to theFirm's overall credit exposure, and credit protection sold totaled less than$500&nbsp;million in notional exposure at December&nbsp;31, 2002.JPMorgan Chase's utilization of credit derivatives for its portfolio managementactivities related to loans and lending-related commitments does not qualifyfor hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These derivatives are marked-to-market inTrading revenue, whereas the loans and lending-related commitments being hedgedare accounted for on an accrual basis in Net interest income. This asymmetry inaccounting treatment between loans and lending-related commitments and thederivatives utilized&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;in the portfolio management activities causes earnings volatility that is notrepresentative of the true changes in value of the Firm's overall creditexposures. The mark-to-market treatment of both the Firm's derivatives hedges(&#147;short&#148; credit positions) and derivatives counterparty exposure (&#147;long&#148; creditpositions) provide some natural offset of each other. Included in Tradingrevenue are gains of $127&nbsp;million in 2002 related to credit derivatives thatwere used to hedge the Firm's credit exposure. Of the $127&nbsp;million,approximately $94&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivatives used to hedgeaccrual lending activities. Trading revenues incorporate both the cost of hedgepremiums and changes in value due to spread movements and credit events.Dealer/client activityJPMorgan Chase's dealer activity in credit derivatives is client-driven. Thebusiness acts as a market maker in single-name credit derivatives and alsostructures more complex transactions for clients' investment or risk managementpurposes. The credit derivatives trading function operates within the sameframework as other market-making desks. Risk limits are established and closelymonitored.As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, the total notional amounts of protection purchased andsold by the dealer business were $159&nbsp;billion and $172&nbsp;billion, respectively.The mismatch between these notional amounts is attributable to the Firm sellingprotection on large, diversified, predominantly investment-grade portfolios(including the most senior tranches), and then hedging these positions bybuying protection on the more subordinated tranches of the same portfolios. Inaddition, the Firm may use securities to hedge certain derivativepositions. Consequently, while there is a mismatch in notional amounts of creditderivatives, the risk positions are largely matched. The amount of credit riskcontributed by the Firm's credit derivatives dealer activity is immaterial inthe context of JPMorgan Chase's overall credit exposures.Country exposureThe Firm has a comprehensive process for measuring and managing its countryexposures and risk. Exposures to a country include all credit-related lending,trading and investment activities, whether cross-border or locally funded.The table below presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries. Thisdisclosure is based on management's view of country exposure. Exposure amountsare adjusted for credit enhancements (e.g., guarantees and letters of credit)provided by third parties located outside the country if the enhancements fullycover the country risk, as well as the commercial risk. Total exposure includesexposure to both government and private-sector entities in a country.While exposure to Mexico fluctuates as a result of trading activities, thedecrease over the prior year was primarily due to loan maturities andreductions in counterparty exposure on derivatives. The decrease in exposure toBrazil over the prior year-end was due to reductions in loans and derivativeexposures, as well as reductions in local government trading positions.Reductions in Argentina were due to a combination of maturities andwrite-downs. Exposure to Venezuela increased modestly as a result of tradingpositions.Selected country exposure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Consumer portfolioConsumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio modeling, creditscoring and decision-support tools to project credit risks and establishunderwriting standards. Risk parameters are established in the early stages ofproduct development, and the cost of credit risk is an integral part of productpricing and evaluating profit dynamics. Consumer portfolios are monitored toidentify deviations from expected performance and shifts in patterns ofconsumer behavior.JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, creditcards and auto financings. This portfolio is predominantly U.S.-based andcontinues to be geographically well-diversified. The Firm's managed consumerportfolio totaled $156&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, an increase of $22billion, or 16%, from 2001. The pie graph to the right provides a summary ofthe consumer portfolio by loan type at year-end 2002 and each loan type'scharge-off rate. The Firm's largest component, residential mortgage loans,comprised 41% of the total consumer portfolio and is primarily secured by firstmortgages.The following table presents managed consumer credit-related information forthe dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loans for 1&#151;4 family residential mortgages increased 8% during 2002 onincreased originations. While net charge-offs for 2002 increased $6&nbsp;million, or12%, over the prior year, the 2002 net charge-off rate remained low at 0.10%,reflecting the continued strong credit quality of the portfolio. At December31, 2002, the Firm had $1.8&nbsp;billion of subprime residential mortgage loans, ofwhich $1.3&nbsp;billion were held for sale.The Firm analyzes its credit card portfolio on a &#147;managed&#148; basis, whichincludes credit card receivables on the balance sheet and those that have beensecuritized. Managed credit card receivables increased by $9.6&nbsp;billion, or 23%during 2002. Approximately $6.9&nbsp;billion of this growth arose from theacquisition of the Providian Master Trust in February 2002. The managed netcharge-off ratio of 5.87% was 42 basis points higher than in 2001. The increasein the net charge-off rate was a result of higher consumer bankruptcy levels aswell as higher contractual losses (i.e., losses on accounts not bankrupt), due,in large part, to the credit characteristics of the Providian portfolio; theselosses were therefore anticipated at the time of the portfolio acquisition.Auto finance receivables grew by 31% to approximately $34&nbsp;billion, while thenet charge-off rate improved slightly from 0.59% to 0.57% in 2002.In the consumer sector, the Firm currently anticipates higher charge-offs in2003 resulting from increases in loans outstanding; charge-off rates areanticipated to be similar to those experienced in 2002.Consumer loans by geographic region (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase's allowance for credit losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses, including those in which the asset is not specificallyidentified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined. At leastquarterly, the Firm's Risk Management Committee reviews the allowance forcredit losses relative to the risk profile of the Firm's credit portfolio andcurrent economic conditions. The allowance is adjusted based on that review if,in management's judgment, changes are warranted. The allowance includesspecific and expected loss components and a residual component. For furtherdiscussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses, see Criticalaccounting estimates used by the Firm on pages 65&#150;66 and Note 10 on page 82.At December&nbsp;31, 2002, management deemed the allowance for credit losses to beadequate to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable.LoansThe commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $1.60&nbsp;billion atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, an increase of $547&nbsp;million, or 52%, from year-end 2001. Theincrease was primarily attributable to the deterioration in commercial loansrelated to the telecommunications and related industries and cable sectors,which led to an increase in criticized and nonperforming loans.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $613&nbsp;million atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, a decrease of $55&nbsp;million, or 8%, from year-end 2001. Thedecrease reflected a reduction in the amount, and an improvement in the averagequality, of the noncriticized portion of the loan portfolio.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.36&nbsp;billion atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, an increase of $255&nbsp;million, or 12%, from year-end 2001. Theincrease was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Providianportfolio by Cardmember Services. This increase was partially offset by areduction in the amount of retained credit card loans (excluding those in theProvidian portfolio) and a reduction in expected loss rates in the Auto Financeportfolio as a result of improved delinquency rates.The residual component of the allowance was $774&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2002,an increase of $79&nbsp;million, or 11%, from year-end 2001. Management views theresidual component as necessary to address uncertainties at December&nbsp;31, 2002,primarily in the commercial portfolio. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, the residualcomponent represented approximately 14% of the total allowance for loan losses,within the Firm's target range of between 10% and 20%.Summary of changes in the allowanceCredit costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lending-related commitmentsTo provide for the risk of loss inherent in the credit-extension process,management also computes specific and expected loss components as well as aresidual component for lending-related commitments. This is computed using amethodology similar to that used for the loan portfolio, modified for expectedmaturities and probabilities of drawdown. The allowance increased due todeterioration in the criticized portion of the Firm's lending-relatedcommitments. In 2002, the Firm charged-off $212&nbsp;million of a lending-relatedcommitment to one obligor in the telecommunications and related industrysegment.Capital allocation for credit riskUnexpected credit losses drive the allocation of credit risk capital byportfolio segment. In the commercial portfolio, capital allocations aredifferentiated by risk rating, loss severity, maturity and correlations. Withinthe consumer businesses, capital allocations are differentiated by product andby product segment.For the commercial portfolio, the Firm in 2003 will begin aligning itsassessment of credit risk capital to correspond more closely to marketconditions, both at the time of the credit extension and on an ongoing basis.This is intended to facilitate risk management, by taking advantage of thegrowing market in credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales, and toencourage earlier action in the event of market deterioration. In determiningthe amount of credit risk capital that should be associated with creditexposures, the Firm will emphasize current, market-based estimates of defaultlikelihood and credit deterioration implied from credit spreads and equityprices, rather than historical averages. Concurrently, the Firm will assess thevaluation impact of credit deterioration as well as anticipated lossesassociated with default.Depending on market conditions, the assessment of credit risk capital isexpected to vary with changes in credit spreads in the market. The newmethodology is expected to increase the amount of credit risk capital allocatedto the commercial portfolio. This expected increase in credit risk capital willbe partially offset by methodology changes to operating risk capital (see thediscussion on Capital allocation for operational and business risk on page 64).The Firm will also continue to refine in 2003 its processes for establishingcredit exposure limits for industry and single-name concentrations, includinginvestment-grade obligors.For the consumer portfolio, consumer products are placed into categories withhomogenous credit characteristics, from which default rates and charge-offs canbe estimated. The credit risk capital to be allocated is based on theunexpected loss inherent in those segments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Market risk managementMarket risk represents the potential loss in value of portfolios and financialinstruments caused by movements in market variables, such as interest andforeign-exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices.JPMorgan Chase employs comprehensive, rigorous processes intended to measure,monitor, and control market risk.Risk management processesMarket Risk Management is an independent corporate governance function thatidentifies, measures, monitors and controls market risk. It seeks to facilitateefficient risk/return decisions and to reduce volatility in operatingperformance by making the Firm's market risk profile transparent to seniormanagement, the Board of Directors and regulators.Market Risk Management reports to the Vice Chairman for Finance, RiskManagement, and Administration. Within the group, individual coverage teams areassigned to particular businesses and have expertise in the types of riskspecific to those businesses. Each team is responsible for measuring,monitoring, and controlling market risk for its business.In addition to the coverage teams, two groups are managed under a joint mandatewith Credit Risk Policy. One group is responsible for country risk andcounterparty risk. The second group develops the methodologies for measuringrisk and allocating market and credit risk capital throughout the Firm.Finally, the Policy Reporting and Analysis group within Market Risk Managementis responsible for developing the policies that control the market riskmanagement processes and for aggregating, interpreting, and distributing marketrisk-related information throughout the Firm.There are other groups reporting to the Vice Chairman with some responsibilityfor managing market risk. For example, within the Finance area, the ValuationControl Group is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the valuations of allpositions taken within IB.Management of market risk is not, however, confined to a central organization.Business units are expected to maintain strong risk discipline at all levels.Trading businesses, for example, have functions that act independently fromtrading personnel and are responsible for verifying risk exposures taken withintheir businesses. In addition, businesses are expected to report exposureswhich may be unusually large or may not fit existing risk measurementmethodologies.Risk measurementBecause no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, the Firm usesseveral measures, both statistical and nonstatistical, including:Value-at-RiskJPMorgan Chase's statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the dollar amount ofpotential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment andprovides a consistent cross-business measure of risk profiles and levels ofrisk diversification. VAR is used to compare risks across businesses, tomonitor limits and to allocate economic capital. In a normal tradingenvironment, VAR provides risk transparency to senior management, businessheads, regulators and investors.Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VAR calculation thatincludes its trading, investment, and asset/liability (&#147;A/L&#148;) managementactivities. JPMorgan Chase's VAR calculation is highly granular, comprisingmore than 500,000 positions and 200,000 pricing series (e.g., securitiesprices, interest rates, foreign-exchange rates). For a large portion of itsexposure, the Firm has implemented full-revaluation VAR, which, managementbelieves, generates more accurate results.To calculate VAR, the Firm uses historical simulation, which measures riskacross instruments and portfolios in a consistent, comparable way. Thisapproach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative offuture changes. The simulation is based on data for the previous 12&nbsp;months.Key terms:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All statistical models involve a degree of uncertainty, depending on theassumptions they employ. The Firm prefers historical simulation because itinvolves fewer assumptions about the distribution of portfolio losses thanparameter-based methodologies. In addition, the Firm regularly assesses thequality of the market data, since their accuracy is critical to computing VAR.Nevertheless, to the extent that VAR is largely based on historical marketdata, it may not accurately reflect future risk during environments in whichmarket volatility is changing. In addition, the VAR measure on any particularday is not indicative of future risk levels, since positions and marketconditions may both change over time.Aggregate portfolioThe Firm calculated the VAR numbers reported above using a one-day time horizonand a 99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to incur lossesgreater than predicted by VAR estimates only once in every 100 trading days, orabout 2.5 times a year. In 2002, there were no days on which actual Firm-widemarket risk-related losses exceeded corporate VAR, a result which does notdiffer significantly from the 99% confidence level.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thetable above provides a meaningful overview of the Firm's market risk exposurearising from trading activities and the investment and A/L portfolios. VARs forthe investment portfolio and A/L activities measure the amount of potentialchange in their economic value; however, they are not measures of reportedrevenues since those activities are not marked-to-market through earnings.The daily average trading VAR for the 12&nbsp;months of 2002 was $71.6&nbsp;million. Thelargest contributor was interest rate risk, which includes credit spread risk;before portfolio diversification, interest rate risk accounted for roughlytwo-thirds of the average VAR. The diversification effect, which averaged$(28.9) million in 2002, reflects the fact that the largest losses fordifferent positions and risks do not typically occur at the same time. The riskof a portfolio of positions is therefore usually less than the sum of the risksof the positions themselves. The degree of diversification is determined bothby the extent to which different market variables tend to move together, and bythe extent to which different businesses have similar positions.The reduction in trading VAR between year-end 2002 and 2001 was drivenprimarily by declines in market volatilities, particularly in interest ratesand energy prices. In general, over the course of a year, VAR exposures canvary significantly as trading positions change and market volatilityfluctuates.The histogram on the following page illustrates the Firm's daily marketrisk-related revenue, defined as the daily change in value of themark-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income,brokerage commissions, underwriting fees or other revenue. The chart shows thatthe Firm posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 226 out of 258days in 2002, with 63&nbsp;days exceeding $50&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained on 32of the 258&nbsp;days; 17 of those days were in the third quarter. Poor overalltrading results in that quarter accounted for the losses during those 17&nbsp;days.No daily trading loss during the year was in excess of $64&nbsp;million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.The average daily market risk-related revenue during 2002 was $31.2&nbsp;million.The weakest performance occurred during the third quarter, when it averaged$18.0&nbsp;million. This lower revenue was not due to generally increased risk takenduring the quarter, but rather reflected the outcome of specific positioningdecisions. Performance improved during the fourth quarter, as average dailymarket risk-related revenue increased to $33.6&nbsp;million, while the average VARremained slightly below the average for all of 2002. Thus, the improvement inmarket risk-related revenues during the fourth quarter was not accompanied byan overall increase in the level of risk taken.To evaluate the soundness of its VAR model, the Firm conducts dailyback-testing of VAR against actual financial results, based on daily marketrisk-related revenue. The Firm's definition of market risk-related revenue isconsistent with the Federal Reserve Board's implementation of the BasleCommittee's market risk capital rules. The Federal Reserve Board's guidelinesstate that such revenue typically includes fee income and commissionsassociated with trading activities, in addition to realized and unrealizedgains and losses on portfolio positions. The inset examines the 32&nbsp;days onwhich JPMorgan Chase posted trading losses and depicts the amount by which VARwas greater than the actual loss on each day. No losses exceeded VAR on any ofthese days, a performance statistically consistent with the Firm's 99%confidence level.Stress testingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. Stress testing is equally important as VAR in measuring andcontrolling risk. Stress testing enhances the understanding of the Firm's riskprofile and loss potential and is used for limits monitoring, cross-businessrisk measurement and economic capital allocation.The Firm stress tests its portfolios at least once a month, at both thecorporate and business segment levels, using multiple scenarios. Scenarios arecontinually reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the Firm's risk profileand economic events. Stress results, trends and explanations are provided eachmonth to the Firm's senior management to help them better measure and managerisks to understand event risk-sensitive positions.Applying economic-value stress tests to the trading and investment portfoliosand A/L activities helps the Firm understand how the economic value of itsbalance sheet (not the amounts reported under GAAP) would change under certainscenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The following table represents the potential economic value stress-test loss(pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase'sstress-test scenarios:Largest monthly stress-test loss &#151; pre-taxThe Firm's stress-test methodology assumes that, during an actual stress event,no action would be taken to change the risk profile of portfolios. Thiscaptures the decreased liquidity that often occurs with abnormal markets andresults, in the Firm's view, in a conservative stress-test result.Economic-value stress tests are performed at varying dates each month; thestress results at December&nbsp;5, 2002, were mostly driven by exposures sensitiveto a stress scenario where credit spreads widen significantly and, at the sametime, equity prices decline and interest rates fall in the major currencies.VAR results cannot be directly correlated to stress-test loss results for threereasons. First, stress-test losses are calculated at varying dates each month,while VAR is performed daily and reported for the period-end date. Second, VARand stress tests are two distinct risk measurements yielding very differentloss potentials. Thus, although the same trading portfolios are used for bothtests, VAR is based on a distribution of one-day historical losses measuredover the most recent one year; in contrast, stress testing subjects theportfolio to more extreme, larger moves over a longer time horizon (e.g., 2-3weeks). Third, as VAR and stress tests are distinct risk measurements, theimpact of portfolio diversification can vary greatly. For VAR, markets canchange in patterns over a one-year time horizon, moving from highly correlatedto less so; in stress testing, the focus is on a single event and theassociated correlations in an extreme market situation. As a result, while VARover a given time horizon can be lowered by a diversification benefit in theportfolio, this benefit would not necessarily manifest itself in stress-testscenarios, which assume large coherent moves across all markets.The Firm conducts both economic-value and NII stress tests on its investmentportfolios and A/L activities, which are not accounted for on a trading basis.Economic-value stress tests measure the potential change in the value of theseportfolios under the same scenarios used to evaluate the trading portfolios.The largest potential stress-test loss of these portfolios as of December&nbsp;5,2002, is under a scenario that assumes a sharp widening in credit spreads anddecreases in interest rates. If the wholesale loan portfolio is excluded, thelargest potential stress-test loss is associated with a scenario that assumes asmaller widening in credit spreads but also assumes significant declines inequity prices and increases in market volatilities. At present, theeconomic-value stress tests do not include consumer loans, the value of whichis more difficult to relate to external market variables; this will be thesubject of continued research.The more conventional NII stress test measures the potential change in theFirm's NII over the next year. These stress tests highlight exposures tovarious interest rate-sensitive factors, such as rates (e.g., the prime-lendingrate), pricing strategies on deposits and changes in product mix. NII stresstests also take into account forecasted balance sheet changes, such as assetsales and securitizations, as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior.At year-end 2002, JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NII stress loss wasestimated at $277&nbsp;million, primarily the result of potential compression indeposit spreads associated with further rate declines from the current low-rateenvironment.Other statistical and nonstatistical risk measuresIn addition to VAR, JPMorgan Chase employs the Risk identification for largeexposures (&#147;RIFLE&#148;) methodology as another statistical risk measure. The Firmrequires that all market risk-taking businesses self assess their risks tounusual and specific events. Individuals who manage risk positions,particularly complex positions, identify potential &#147;worst-case&#148; losses thatcould arise from an unusual or specific event, such as a potential tax change,and estimate the probabilities of such losses. Through the Firm's RIFLE system,this information is then directed to the appropriate level of management,thereby permitting the Firm to identify further earnings vulnerabilities notadequately covered by VAR and stress testing.Nonstatistical risk measures other than stress testing include net openpositions, basis point values, option sensitivities, position concentrationsand position turnover. These measures provide additional information on anexposure's size and the direction in which it is moving. Nonstatisticalmeasures are used for limit monitoring, one-off approvals and tactical control.Capital allocation for market riskThe Firm allocates market risk capital guided by the principle that capitalshould reflect the extent to which risks are present in businesses. Daily VAR,monthly stress results and other factors determine appropriate capital chargesfor major business lines. The VAR measure captures a large number of one-dayprice moves, while stress tests capture a smaller number of very large pricemoves. The Firm allocates market risk capital to each division according to aformula that weights that division's VAR and stress-test exposures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Risk monitoring and controlLimitsThe Firm controls market risk primarily through a series of limits. The sizesof limits reflect the Firm's risk appetite after extensive analyses of themarket environment and business strategy. The analyses examine factors such asmarket volatility, product liquidity, business track record, and managementexperience and depth.The Firm maintains different levels of limits. Corporate-level limits encompassVAR calculations and stress-test loss advisories. Similarly, business segmentlevels include limits on VAR calculations, nonstatistical measurements, and P&Lloss advisories. Businesses are responsible for adhering to established limits,against which exposures are monitored and reported daily. Exceeded limits arereported immediately to senior management, and the affected business unit musttake appropriate action to reduce trading positions. If the business cannot dothis within an acceptable timeframe, senior management is consulted on theappropriate action.Market Risk Management regularly reviews and updates risk limits, and theFirm's Risk Management Committee reviews and approves the risk limits at leasttwice a year. Market Risk Management further controls the Firm's exposure byspecifically designating approved financial instruments for each business unit.Qualitative risk assessmentThe Firm's Market Risk Management Group also performs periodic reviews of bothbusinesses and products with exposure to market risk, in order to assess theability of the businesses to control market risk. The business management'sstrategy, market conditions, product details and effectiveness of risk controlsare reviewed. Specific recommendations for improvements are made to management.Model reviewMany of the Firm's financial instruments cannot be valued based on quotedmarket prices, but are instead valued using pricing models. Such models areused for management of risk positions, such as reporting risk against limits,as well as for valuation. The Firm reviews the models it uses to assess modelappropriateness and consistency across businesses. The model reviews consider anumber of issues: appropriateness of the model, assessing the extent to whichit accurately reflects the characteristics of the transaction and captures itssignificant risks; independence and reliability of data sources;appropriateness and adequacy of numerical algorithms; and sensitivity to inputparameters or other assumptions which cannot be priced from the market.Reviews are conducted for new or changed models, as well as previously acceptedmodels. Re-reviews assess whether there have been any material changes to theaccepted models; whether there have been any changes in the product or marketthat may impact the validity of the model; and whether there have been newtheoretical or competitive developments that may require a reassessment of themodel's adequacy. For a summary of valuations based on models, see Criticalaccounting estimates used by the Firm on pages 65-67.Policies and proceduresJPMorgan Chase maintains policies and procedures surrounding market riskmanagement practices. The goal is to specify a clear set of objectives,responsibilities and procedures throughout the market risk managementinfrastructure to produce a consistent approach to risk measurement, monitoringand control across business lines. &nbsp;Operational risk managementOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failedprocesses or systems, human factors, or external events.OverviewOperational risk is inherent in each of the Firm's businesses and supportactivities. Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways, includingerrors, business interruptions, inappropriate behavior of employees, andvendors not performing in accordance with outsourcing arrangements. Theseevents can potentially result in financial losses and other damage to the Firm,including causing it reputational harm.To monitor and control operational risk, the Firm maintains a system ofcomprehensive policies and a control framework designed to provide a sound andwell-controlled operational environment. The goal is to keep operational riskat appropriate levels, in light of the Firm's financial strength, thecharacteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates, and thecompetitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject.Notwithstanding these control measures, the Firm incurs operational losses. TheFirm's approach to operational risk management is intended to mitigate suchlosses.Operational risk management practicesOperational risk management practicesThroughout 2002, the Firm continued to execute a multi-year plan, begun in2001, for an integrated approach that emphasizes active management ofoperational risk throughout the Firm. The objective of this effort is tosupplement the traditional control-based approach to operational risk with riskmeasures, tools and disciplines that are risk-specific, consistently appliedand utilized Firm-wide. Key themes for this effort are transparency ofinformation, escalation of key issues, and accountability for issue resolution.Ultimate responsibility for the Firm's operational risk management practicesresides with the Vice Chairman for Finance, Risk Management and Administration.The components are:Governance structure: The governance structure provides the framework for theFirm's operational risk management activities. Primary responsibility formanaging operational risk rests with business managers. These individuals areresponsible for establishing and maintaining appropriate internal controlprocedures for their respective businesses.The Operational Risk Committee is comprised of senior operational risk andfinance managers from each of the businesses. This committee meets quarterly todiscuss key operational risk issues of importance to the Firm. In addition,each of the businesses must maintain business control committees to overseetheir operational risk management practices.Self-assessment process: In 2002, the Firm continued to refine its Firm-wideself-assessment process. The focus of the process is for each business toidentify the key operational risks specific to its environment, and assess thedegree to which it is maintaining appropriate controls. Action plans aredeveloped for control issues identified, and businesses are held accountablefor tracking and resolving these issues on a timely basis.Self-assessments are completed by the businesses utilizing Horizon, a softwareapplication developed by the Firm. With the aid of Horizon, the Firm moved in2002 from an annual, yearend self-assessment process to one performedsemiannually. Going forward, the Firm plans to utilize this self-assessmentprocess as an ongoing, dynamic risk management tool.Operational risk-event monitoring: The Firm has a process for reportingoperational risk-event data, permitting analyses of errors and losses as wellas trends. Such analyses, performed both at a line-of-business level and byrisk-event type, enables identification of root causes associated with riskevents faced by the businesses. Where available, the internal data can besupplemented with external data for comparative analysis with industrypatterns. The data reported will also enable the Firm to back-test againstself-assessment results.Audit alignment: In addition to conducting independent internal audits, theFirm's internal audit department has provided guidance on the design andimplementation of the operational risk framework. This guidance has helpedfurther the Firm-wide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.implementation of the framework, which in turn has led to a stronger overallcontrol environment. The department utilizes output such as businessself-assessment results to help focus allocation of its resources, therebymaximizing the efficiencies of its internal audit responsibilities. Thedepartment also reviews the effectiveness and accuracy of the self-assessmentprocess during the conduct of audits.Capital allocation for operational and business riskHistorically, a combined capital amount for operational risk and business risk(collectively referred to as &#147;operating risk&#148; capital) was derived throughtop-down benchmarking, by business, against comparable financial institutions.In 2003, a new risk-based capital allocation methodology will replace theexisting approach. The new methodology will separate operating risk capitalinto its two discrete components, operational risk and business risk. The newapproach will estimate these risks independently and allocate capital to eachcomponent. It is estimated that this new approach will result in a lower amountof capital than previously calculated.Operational Risk: The new operational risk capital model is loss-based, withadjustments to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment, andwith a potential offset for the use of risk-transfer products. The Firmbelieves that the model will be consistent with the proposed Basle II Accord,and expects to propose it eventually for qualification under the AdvancedMeasurement Approach for operational risk.Business Risk: Business risk capital represents the risk associated with thevolatility in the Firm's earnings due to factors not captured by other parts ofthe Firm's economic capital framework. Such volatility can arise fromineffective design or execution of business strategies, volatile economic orfinancial market activity, changing client expectations and demands, andrestructuring to adjust for changes in the competitive environment. Capitalwill be allocated to each business based on historical revenue volatility andmeasures of fixed and variable expenses. Earnings volatility arising from otherrisk factors, such as credit or market risk, will be excluded from themeasurement of business risk capital, as these factors are captured under thoserisk capital models.Reputation riskA firm's success depends not only on its prudent management of credit, marketand operational risks, but equally on the maintenance of its reputation amongmany constituents &#151; clients, investors, regulators, as well as the generalpublic &#151; for business practices of the highest quality.Attention to its reputation has always been a key aspect of the Firm'spractices and maintenance of reputation is everyone's responsibility. The Firmbolsters this individual responsibility in many ways: codes of ethics,training, policies and oversight functions that approve transactions, including a Conflicts Office to examinetransactions with the potential to create conflicts of interest or roles forthe Firm.During 2002, the Firm put in place an additional structure to take account ofthe potential for adverse reputational impact of transactions with clients,especially complex derivatives and structured finance transactions. Thestructure reinforces the Firm's procedures for examining transactions in termsof appropriateness, ethical issues and reputational risk and intensifies theFirm's scrutiny of the purpose and effect of its transactions from the client'spoint of view with the goal that these transactions are not used to deceiveinvestors or others. This new structure operates at three levels: as part ofevery business' transaction approval process, review by regional Policy ReviewCommittees, and oversight by the Policy Review Office.Business transaction approvalPrimary responsibility for adherence with the policies and procedures designedto address reputation risk lies with the business units conducting thetransactions in question. This transaction approval process requires review andsign-off from, among others, internal legal/compliance, conflicts, tax andaccounting policy groups. Transactions involving an SPE established by the Firmreceive particular scrutiny and must comply with a Special-Purpose VehiclePolicy, designed to ensure that every such entity is properly approved,documented, monitored and controlled.Regional policy review committeesBusiness units are also required to submit to regional Policy Review Committeesproposed transactions that may raise reputation risk for any reason &#151;including, where applicable, intended financial disclosure of the transactionby the client &#151; and the committees approve, reject or require furtherclarification or changes. The members of these committees are seniorrepresentatives of the business and support units in the region. The committeesmay escalate transaction review to the Policy Review Office.Policy review officeThe Policy Review Office is the most senior approval level for clienttransactions involving reputation issues. The mandate of the Office is to opineon specific transactions brought by the Regional Committees and considerchanges in policies or practices relating to reputation risk. The head of theOffice consults with the Firm's most senior executives on specific topics andprovides regular updates.Aside from governance and guidance on specific transactions, the objective ofthe policy review process is to reinforce a culture, through a &#147;case-study&#148;approach, which ensures that all employees, regardless of seniority, understandthe basic principles of reputation risk control and can recognize and addressissues as they arise.&nbsp; &nbsp;Private equity risk managementRisk managementJPMorgan Partners employs processes for risk measurement and control that aresimilar to those used for other businesses within the Firm. The processes arecoordinated with the Firm's overall approach to market and concentration risk.Private equity risk is initially monitored through the use of industry andgeographic limits. Additionally, to manage the pace of new investment, aceiling on the amount of annual private equity investment activity has beenset.JPMorgan Partners' public equity holdings create a significant exposure togeneral declines in the equity markets. To gauge that risk, VAR and stress-testexposures are calculated in the same way as they are for the Firm's trading,investment and asset/liability management portfolios. During the year, JPMPmanagement undertook frequent reviews of its public security holdings as partof a disciplined approach to sales and hedging issues. Hedging programs arevery limited, but are considered when practical and as circumstances dictate.Over time, the Firm may change the nature and type of hedges it enters into, aswell as close a hedging position altogether.Capital allocation for private equity riskInternal capital is allocated to JPMP's public equities portfolio based onstress scenarios that are similar to those applied to other businesses, andwhich reflects the potential loss inherent in the portfolio in the event of alarge equity market decline. Capital is also allocated against illiquidityrisk, which results from the contractual sales restrictions to which someholdings are subject. For private equities, capital is allocated based on along-term equity market stress scenario that is consistent with the investmenttime horizons associated with these holdings. For these investments, additionalcapital is allocated against the risk of an unexpectedly large number ofwrite-offs or write-downs. The overall internal capital allocation isapproximately 53% of the investments' carrying value.Critical accounting estimates used by the FirmThe Firm's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral tounderstanding the results reported. The Firm's most complex accountingestimates require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assetsand liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and controlprocedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods, including anyjudgments made, are well controlled, independently reviewed and appliedconsistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and proceduresare intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in anappropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining thevaluation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.The following is a brief description of the Firm's critical accountingestimates involving significant management valuation judgments.Allowance for Credit LossesJPMorgan Chase's Allowance for credit losses covers the commercial and consumerloan portfolios as well as the Firm's portfolio of lending-related commitments.The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the value of the Firm'sloan assets for probable credit losses as of the balance sheet date inaccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management alsocomputes an allowance for lending-related commitments using a methodologysimilar to that used for the commercial loan portfolio. For a furtherdiscussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm's Allowance forcredit losses, see Note 10 on page 82.Commercial loans and lending-related commitmentsThe methodology for calculating both allowances involves significant judgment.First and foremost, it involves the early identification of credits that aredeteriorating. Second, it involves management judgment to derive loss factors.The Firm uses a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of itsloans. Commercial loans are reviewed for information affecting the obligor'sability to fulfill its obligations. In assessing the risk rating of aparticular loan, among the factors considered include the obligor's debtcapacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor's earnings, theamount and sources of repayment, the level and nature of contingencies,management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligoroperates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical information,as well as subjective assessment and interpretation. Emphasizing one factorover another or considering additional factors that may be relevant indetermining the risk rating of a particular loan, but which are not currentlyan explicit part of the Firm's methodology, could impact the risk ratingassigned by the Firm to that loan.Management also applies its judgment to derive loss factors associated witheach credit facility. These loss factors are determined by facility structure,collateral and type of obligor. Wherever possible, the Firm uses independent,verifiable data or the Firm's own historical loss experience in its models forestimating these loss factors. Many factors can affect management's estimatesof specific loss and expected loss, including volatility of defaultprobabilities, rating migrations and loss severity. For example, judgment is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.required to determine how many years of data to include when estimating thepossible severity of the loss. If a full credit cycle is not captured in thedata, then estimates may be inaccurate. Likewise, judgment is applied todetermine whether the loss severity factor should be calculated as an averageover the entire credit cycle or whether to apply the loss severity factorimplied at a particular point in the credit cycle. The application of differentloss severity factors would change the amount of the allowance for creditlosses determined appropriate by the Firm. Similarly, there are judgments as towhich external data on default probabilities should be used, and when theyshould be used. Choosing data that are not reflective of the Firm's specificloan portfolio characteristics could affect loss estimates.As noted above, the Firm's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the riskrating assigned to a loan. Assuming, for all commercial loans, a one-notchdowngrade in the Firm's internal risk ratings, the allowance for loan lossesfor commercial loans would increase by approximately $850&nbsp;million at December31, 2002. This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used withcaution. The purpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impactrisk ratings have on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses forcommercial loans. It is not intended to imply management's expectation offuture deterioration in risk ratings. Given the process the Firm follows indetermining risk ratings of its loans, management believes the current riskratings assigned to commercial loans are appropriate and the likelihood of aone-notch downgrade for all commercial loans is remote.Consumer loansThe consumer portfolio is segmented into three main business lines: Chase HomeFinance, Chase Cardmember Services and Chase Auto Finance. For each majorportfolio segment within each line of business, there are three primary factorsthat are considered in determining the expected loss component of the allowancefor loan losses: period-end outstandings, expected loss factor, and averagelife. The various components of these factors, such as collateral, prepaymentrates, credit score distributions, collections, and the historical lossexperience of a business segment, differ across business lines. For example,credit card revolving credit has significantly higher charge-off ratios thanfixed mortgage credit. Determination of each factor is based primarily onstatistical data and macroeconomic assumptions.Residual componentManagement's judgments are also applied when considering uncertainties thatrelate to current macroeconomic and political conditions, the impact ofcurrency devaluation on cross-border exposures, changes in underwritingstandards, unexpected correlations within the portfolio, or other factors. Forexample, judgment as to political developments in a particular country willaffect management's assessment of potential loss in the credits that haveexposure to that country. A separate allowance component, the residualcomponent, is maintained to cover these uncertainties, principally, at December31, 2002, in the commercial portfolio. It is anticipated that the residualcomponent will range between 10% and 20% of the total allowance for creditlosses.Fair value of financial instrumentsA portion of JPMorgan Chase's assets and liabilities are carried at fair value,including trading assets and liabilities, AFS securities and private equityinvestments. Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of fair valueor cost. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, approximately $369&nbsp;billion of the Firm's assetswere recorded at fair value.Fair value is defined as the value at which positions could be closed out orsold in a transaction with a willing and knowledgeable counterparty over aperiod of time consistent with JPMorgan Chase's trading or investment strategy.The majority of the Firm's assets reported at fair value are based on quotedmarket prices or on internally developed models that are based on independentlysourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves, optionvolatilities and currency rates. The valuation process takes into considerationfactors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and, for the derivativeportfolio, counterparty credit risk. See the discussion of CVA on page 51.Management applies judgment in determining the factors used in the valuationprocess. For example, there is often limited market data to rely on whenestimating the fair value of a large or aged position. Similarly, judgment mustbe applied in estimating prices for less readily observable externalparameters. Finally, other factors such as model assumptions, marketdislocations and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value.Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of revenue orloss recorded for a particular position.Trading and available-for-sale portfoliosSubstantially all of the Firm's securities held for trading and investmentpurposes (&#147;long&#148; positions) and securities that the Firm has sold to otherparties but does not own (&#147;short&#148; positions) are valued based on quoted marketprices. However, certain of the securities, for example high yield instruments,are less actively traded. The determination of their fair value requiresmanagement judgment, as this determination may require benchmarking to similarinstruments or analyzing default and recovery rates.As few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the majority of theFirm's derivative positions are valued using internally developed models thatuse as their basis readily observable market parameters &#151; that is, parametersthat are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources, includingindustry-pricing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;services. Certain derivatives, however, are valued based on models withsignificant unobservable market parameters &#151; that is, parameters that may beestimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment to substantiatethe model valuation. These instruments are less actively traded and couldinclude, for example, long-dated interest rate or currency swaps, where swaprates may be unobservable for longer maturities.Management judgment includes recording fair value adjustments (i.e.,reductions) to model valuations to account for parameter uncertainty whenvaluing complex or less actively traded derivative transactions.The following table summarizes the Firm's trading and available-for-saleportfolios by valuation methodology at December&nbsp;31, 2002:To ensure that the valuations are appropriate, the Firm has various controls inplace. These include: an independent review and approval of valuation models;detailed review and explanation for profit and loss analyzed daily and throughtime; decomposing the model valuations for certain structured derivativeinstruments into their components and benchmarking valuations where possible tosimilar products; and validating valuation estimates through actual cashsettlement. As markets and products develop and the pricing for certainderivative products becomes more transparent, the Firm refines its valuationmethodologies. The Valuation Control Group within the Finance area isresponsible for reviewing the accuracy of the valuations of all positions takenwithin the Investment Bank.For a discussion of market risk management, including the model review process,see pages 58&#150;62. For a discussion of the developments affecting theaccounting for trading derivatives, see page 68. For further details on thetrading and AFS portfolios, see Note 3 and Note 7, respectively.Private equity investmentsValuation of private investments held by JPMorgan Partners requires significantmanagement judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lackof liquidity and long-term nature of such assets. Private investments areinitially valued based on cost. The carrying values of private investments areadjusted from cost to reflect both positive and negative changes evidenced byfinancing events with third-party capital providers. In addition, theseinvestments are subject to ongoing impairment reviews by JPMP's seniorinvestment professionals. A variety of factors are reviewed and monitored toassess impairment, including but not limited to, operating performance andfuture expectations, comparable industry valuations of public companies,changes in market outlook, and third-party financing environment over time. Foradditional information about private equity investments, see the Private equityrisk management discussion on page 65 and Note 13 on page 88.MSRs and certain other retained interestsMSRs and certain other retained interests from securitization activities do nottrade in an active open market with readily observable prices. For example,sales of MSRs do occur, but the precise terms and conditions are typically notreadily available. As such, the Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs andcertain other retained interests using a discounted future cash flow model. Themodel considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicingfees and prepayment assumptions, delinquent rates, late charges, otherancillary revenues, costs to service and other economic factors. The Firmcompares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market datawhere available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.Management believes that the fair values and related assumptions are comparableto those used by other market participants. For a further discussion of themost significant assumptions used to value these retained interests, as well asthe applicable stress tests for those assumptions, see Notes 11 and 12 on pages83&#150;87 and 87&#150;88, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Accounting and reporting developmentsAccounting for stock-based compensationIn August 2002, JPMorgan Chase announced its decision to adopt SFAS 123,beginning January 2003. SFAS 123 establishes accounting for stock-basedcompensation that requires all such transactions, including stock options, tobe accounted for at fair value and such amounts to be recognized in earnings.The Firm adopted the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 effective January&nbsp;1,2003, using the prospective transition method. Under this method, all newawards granted to employees on or after January&nbsp;1, 2003 will be accounted forat fair value. Awards outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, if not subsequentlymodified, continue to be accounted for under APB 25. It is estimated that theadoption of SFAS 123, with respect to employee stock-based compensation awardsgranted in February 2003, will reduce the Firm's net income by approximately$0.08 per share in 2003.Consolidation of variable interest entitiesIn January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46. The entities that would be assessedfor consolidation under FIN 46 are typically referred to as Special-PurposeEntities (&#147;SPEs&#148;), although other non-SPE-type entities may also be subject tothe guidance. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated bya company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from thevariable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of theentity's residual returns, or both. The provisions are effective for any newentities that are originated subsequent to January&nbsp;31, 2003. For entities thatwere originated prior to February&nbsp;1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 areeffective July&nbsp;1, 2003.The Firm is assessing the impact of FIN 46 on all variable interest entitieswith which it is involved, including the multi-seller conduit transactions thatare further described in Note 11 on pages 83&#150;87. In their current form, these conduits would be required to beconsolidated on the Firm's balance sheet when FIN 46 is implemented. The Firmis assessing restructuring alternatives associated with the multi-sellerconduits. Management's assessment of possible consolidations of other entitiesthat could be deemed variable interest entities is ongoing as well. However, atthis time, the Firm does not believe that the implementation of FIN 46 willhave a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet, earnings orcapital resources.Guarantor disclosuresIn November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;45, which requires aguarantor to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fairvalue of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 alsorequires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim andannual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees thatit has issued. The disclosure requirements of this Interpretation are effectivefor financial statements ending December&nbsp;31, 2002. The initial recognition andmeasurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospectivebasis to guarantees issued or modified after December&nbsp;31, 2002. The applicationof FIN 45 will not have a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated statementof income or Consolidated balance sheet. See Note 29 on pages102&#150;103 for FIN45 disclosures.Accounting for trading derivativesIn October 2002, the Emerging IssuesTask Force concluded on Issue 02&#150;03,which precludes mark-to-market accounting for energy-related contracts that donot meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS 133 (e.g., transportation,storage, or capacity contracts) effective January&nbsp;1, 2003. This decision willnot have a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated statement of income. InNovember 2002, as part of the discussion of Issue 02&#150;03, the FASB stafffurther confirmed their view that an entity should not recognize profit at theinception of a trade involving a derivative financial instrument in the absenceof: (a)&nbsp;quoted market prices in an active market, (b)&nbsp;observable prices ofother current market transactions, or (c)&nbsp;other observable data supporting avaluation technique. This clarification did not have a material impact on theFirm's Consolidated statement of income in 2002. The FASB intends in 2003 tocontinue its focus on issues relating to the fair value of financialinstruments.Impairment of long-lived assetsIn August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, which addresses financial accountingand reporting for the impairment and/or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS 144supersedes and resolves certain implementation issues of SFAS 121, but retainsits fundamental provisions for (a)&nbsp;the recognition and measurement of theimpairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and (b)&nbsp;the measurement oflong-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS 144 also supersedes thebusiness segment disposal provisions of APB 30, but retains its requirement toreport discontinued operations separately from continuing operations andbroadens its definition of discontinued operations from &#147;segment of a business&#148;(activities that represent a major line of business or customer) to &#147;componentof an entity&#148; (operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished,operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of theentity). SFAS 144 does not significantly affect the Firm's operating results.The Firm performs periodic impairment reviews of its long-lived assets inaccordance with SFAS 144, and there are no discontinued operations to report in2002.Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activitiesIn June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, which establishes new accounting forcosts associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after December&nbsp;31,2002. SFAS 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit ordisposal activity to be recorded when that liability is incurred and can bemeasured at fair value. Under the previous rules, if management approved anexit plan in one quarter, the costs of that plan generally would have beenrecorded in the same quarter even if the costs were not incurred until a laterquarter. In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
