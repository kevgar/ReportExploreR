Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chemical Banking Corporation (the "Corporation") reported net income of $477million for the 1995 third quarter, an increase of 9% from earnings of $439million reported for the third quarter of 1994. The Corporation's primaryearnings per share increased 9% to $1.74 per share in the 1995 third quarter,compared with primary earnings of $1.59 per share in the third quarter of 1994.For the first nine months of 1995, the Corporation's net income was $1.315billion, an increase of 18% from $1.115 billion for the first nine months of1994. Primary earnings per share for the 1995 first nine months increased 23% to$4.91 per share, compared with $3.98 per share in the comparable period of 1994.The Corporation's 1995 third quarter and year-to-date results reflect continuedprogress on the Corporation's announced performance goals to increase itsearnings per share, achieve a higher return on common stockholders' equity andan improved efficiency ratio. The Corporation's 1995 third quarter core earningsincreased by more than 20% from the comparable period in 1994, led by gains inglobal finance, regional banking and national consumer businesses.The Corporation's return on average common stockholders' equity was 17.3% forthe third quarter of 1995, compared with 16.9% for the 1994 comparable quarter.For the first nine months, the Corporation's return on average commonstockholders' equity was 16.9% in 1995, compared with 14.4% in 1994. TheCorporation's efficiency ratio improved to 58% for the third quarter of 1995,compared with 63% for the third quarter of 1994. At September 30, 1995, theCorporation's ratios of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and Total Capitalto risk- weighted assets were 7.91% and 11.54%, respectively (excluding theassets and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation'ssecurities subsidiary, Chemical Securities, Inc., as well as the Corporation'sinvestment in such subsidiary). Such risk-based capital ratios were well inexcess of the minimum ratios specified by the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System ("Federal Reserve Board") and at September 30, 1995, theCorporation was "well capitalized" as defined by the Federal Reserve Board.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at September 30, 1995 were $1,047million, down from $1,139 million at December 31, 1994 and a decline of $1,146million from $2,193 million at September 30, 1994. As a result of the continueddecline in nonperforming assets, the ratio of the allowance for credit losses tononperforming loans reached 243% at September 30, 1995, compared with 174% atSeptember 30, 1994. Nonperforming assets have declined by $5,540 million, or84%, from their peak level of $6,587 million in September 1992.On October 6, 1995, the Corporation sold its banking operations in southern andcentral New Jersey to PNC Bank Corp. The transaction is not reflected in theCorporation's 1995 third quarter results. The sale did not include theCorporation's franchise in northeastern New Jersey, where it retains privatebanking operations and 39 branches. - 20 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------NET INTEREST INCOMENet interest income for the third quarter of 1995 was $1,197 million, comparedwith $1,177 million for the same period in 1994. For the first nine months, netinterest income was $3,515 million in 1995, compared with $3,505 million in1994. The improvements in both 1995 periods from the prior year were primarilydue to an increase in interest-earning assets (led by growth in consumer loans),and a higher contribution from noninterest-bearing funds, partially offset bythe impact of higher short-term interest rates.The interest rate spread and the net yield on interest-earning assets declinedin both 1995 periods from the prior year. These declines were principally theresult of narrower loan spreads and higher interest rates on wholesale funding,partially offset by wider deposit spreads and an increased contribution fromnoninterest-bearing funds. The contribution from interest-free funds to the netyield was 77 basis points in the 1995 third quarter, versus a 54 basis pointcontribution in the comparable 1994 period. The improvement from the prior yearis due to the higher interest rate environment during 1995 and an increase of$3.4 billion in interest-free funds in the third quarter of 1995.The following table reflects the composition of interest-earning assets as apercentage of total interest-earning assets and the net yield oninterest-earning assets for the periods indicated. - 21 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The Corporation's average total loans in the 1995 third quarter and first ninemonths increased by $9.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, from thecomparable 1994 periods. The increases reflected the continued growth inconsumer loans (principally from residential mortgage and credit cardactivities) and commercial lending, partially offset by a reduction in thecommercial real estate portfolio. Domestic commercial loan outstandings atSeptember 30, 1995 represented the fifth consecutive quarterly increase sincethe June 30, 1994 level, reflecting an upward trend in commercial lendingactivity. For the remainder of 1995, the Corporation expects continued growth inits loan portfolio, with its consumer loans continuing to grow faster than itscommercial loans. For a further discussion of the Corporation's loans, see theloan portfolio section on page 35. - 22 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The negative impact on net interest income from nonperforming loans (excludingnonperforming loans held for accelerated disposition) in the third quarter of1995 was $13 million, compared with $1 million in the same quarter in 1994. The1994 third quarter amount was unusually low due to the significant amount ofcash collections received by the Corporation during that quarter. For the firstnine months, the negative impact was $51 million in 1995, compared with $58million in 1994. The results for the first nine months of 1995 has benefitedfrom the reduction in the level of the Corporation's nonperforming loans.The favorable impact on net interest income from the Corporation's asset/liability derivative activities, whereby derivative instruments are used in order to alter the yield on certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities, was $8 million for the third quarter of 1995, compared with afavorable impact of $42 million for the third quarter of 1994. For the first nine months, the favorable impact was approximately $24 million in 1995, compared with $161 million in 1994. For a further discussion of derivativeinstruments used in the Corporation's asset/liability management activities,see Note 13 of the Notes to Financial Statements and the Asset/Liability Management section on pages 45-46 of this Form 10-Q.Notwithstanding the sale of its banking operations in southern and central NewJersey to PNC Bank Corp. ("PNC") and credit card securitizations that are expected to occur in the 1995 fourth quarter, management anticipates that net interest income for the fourth quarter of 1995 will be slightly higher than the1994 fourth quarter results primarily as a result of continued loan growth for the remainder of 1995. Management also anticipates that net interest income for full year 1995 will be higher than the 1994 full year level.For additional information on average balances and net interest income, seeAverage Consolidated Balance Sheet, Interest and Rates on pages 51-52.PROVISION FOR LOSSESThe Corporation's provision for losses was $122 million for the 1995 thirdquarter, compared with $120 million in the 1995 second quarter, and $100 millionin the 1994 third quarter. The increase in the provision for losses from the1994 third quarter is mainly the result of higher consumer net charge-offs,notably in the credit card portfolio, a consequence of the significant growth incredit card outstandings. For further information, see Domestic ConsumerPortfolio section on page 38. For the first nine months, the provision forlosses was $362 million in 1995 compared with $465 million in 1994, a result ofthe continued improvement in the Corporation's credit profile. The provision forlosses for the fourth quarter of 1995 is expected to be generally consistentwith the 1995 third quarter level. - 23 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Noninterest revenue declined in the 1995 third quarter but rose in the firstnine months of 1995 when compared with the corresponding 1994 periods. Thedecrease in noninterest revenue for the 1995 third quarter primarily reflects adecline in other revenue resulting from losses from the disposition of emergingmarkets-related securities, compared with gains on such securities recorded inthe prior year's quarter. Noninterest revenue for both the 1995 third quarterand first nine months when compared with the comparable 1994 periods benefitedfrom higher corporate finance and syndication fees, as well as higher securitiesgains and fees for other financial services. Trading revenues were stablequarter-to-quarter but declined in the first nine months of 1995 compared withthe same period last year.The following table presents the components of trust and investment managementfees for the periods indicated.Trust and investment management fees for the 1995 third quarter were $96million, a decline of $8 million from the prior year period. Corporate andinstitutional trust fees in the 1995 third quarter declined $11 million from thesame period a year ago, due to the absence of approximately $13 millionin fees in the 1995 third quarter (for the 1995 nine month period, such feeswere approximately $36 million) related to the shareholder services jointventure with Mellon Bank Corporation (effective January 1, 1995 revenues andexpenses of the business units contributed to the joint venture were reflectedon an equity basis within other revenue).Corporate finance and syndication fees were a record $157 million in the 1995third quarter, an increase of 62% from the prior year period. For the first ninemonths of 1995, such fees rose 49% from the comparable 1994 period. Theincreases from both 1994 periods reflect continued strong growth in globalinvestment banking activities, especially loan syndications and new issues ofhigh-yield securities. During the first nine months of 1995, the Corporationacted as agent or co-agent for approximately $282 billion of syndicated creditfacilities, a reflection of the Corporation's large client base and strongemphasis on distribution. The following table sets forth the components of fees for other banking servicesfor the periods indicated. - 24 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Credit card services revenue for both 1995 periods continues to benefit from theincreased volume of retail credit cards from a growing cardholder base,primarily as a result of the Corporation's co-branded Shell MasterCard program.Outstandings in the credit card lending portfolio were $10.7 billion atSeptember 30, 1995, compared with $8.3 billion at the same date a year ago.Fees in lieu of compensating balances decreased by $2 million in the 1995 thirdquarter and by $15 million in the first nine months of 1995 when compared withthe corresponding 1994 periods. Customers often pay for cash management or otherbanking services by maintaining noninterest-bearing deposits. As interest ratesincrease, the required compensating balance for a given level of service willdecrease. As a result, during the first nine months of 1995, when short-term interest rates were higher than in the first nine months of 1994, a greater volume of customers maintained a compensating balance in lieu of paying a fee for services.Mortgage servicing fees increased $13 million in the first nine months of 1995compared with the prior year period, reflecting a higher level of mortgageservicing volume as a result of the acquisition of Margaretten FinancialCorporation ("Margaretten") on July 1, 1994.Contributing to the rise in other fees for the third quarter and nine months of1995 were increased brokerage commissions of $6 million and $12 million,respectively, due to higher transaction volume at the Corporation's discountbrokerage firm, Brown and Company.The following table sets forth the components of trading revenue for the thirdquarter and first nine months of 1995 and 1994.The decreases in revenue from interest rate contracts during the 1995 thirdquarter and first nine months were primarily due to unexpected volatility incertain European and Asian (particularly Japan) interest rate markets. Foreignexchange revenue in 1995 continued to benefit from volatility in the currencymarkets (in particular from changes in the Yen, DM and pound sterling) and fromthe Corporation's market-making activities (as trading volume was heavy in thethird quarter). The increase in debt instrument revenue during the 1995 thirdquarter, when compared to the same 1994 period, was primarily due to strongperformance in high-yield securities. Emerging markets debt instrument revenueremained stable in the 1995 third quarter, when compared with the same period in1994. - 25 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Trading revenues are affected by many factors, including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by theCorporation on behalf of its customers, the Corporation's success in proprietarypositioning, and the steps taken by central banks and governments which affectfinancial markets. The Corporation believes that its trading business is asignificant core business and that its improved credit standing has improved theCorporation's trading capabilities by enabling the Corporation to utilize awider array of products with additional counterparties. However, the Corporationexpects that its trading revenues will fluctuate as factors, such as marketvolatility, governmental actions, or success in proprietary positioning, varyfrom period to period.Securities gains were $47 million in the 1995 third quarter, compared with gainsof $6 million in the same period last year. For the first nine months,securities gains were $98 million in 1995, as compared with $65 million in 1994.The higher level of securities gains, all of which occurred from theavailable-for-sale portfolio, reflected the Corporation's ability to takeadvantage of favorable bond market conditions. Included in the 1995 nine monthresults was a $13 million permanent impairment loss on Barings Bank PLCsecurities held by the Corporation and an $11 million loss on sales ofavailable-for-sale securities at Chemical Bank New Jersey National Associationthat were undertaken as part of the repositioning of the remaining branchesprior to the sale of the bank to PNC. For further discussion of theCorporation's securities, see Note 4 - Securities of the Notes to FinancialStatements.The following table presents the composition of other noninterest revenue forthe third quarter and first nine months of 1995 and 1994.Revenue from equity-related investments, which includes income from venturecapital activities and emerging markets investments, was $77 million in the 1995third quarter, a decline of $9 million from the comparable 1994 quarter. For thefirst nine months of 1995, revenue from equity-related investments was $310million, a 32% increase from the comparable 1994 period. Revenue fromequity-related investments has averaged approximately $94 million per quarter,based on revenues during the last eight quarterly periods. At September 30,1995, the Corporation had equity-related investments with a carrying value of$2.0 billion. The Corporation believes that equity-related investments willcontinue to make contributions to the Corporation's earnings, although thetiming of the recognition of gains from such activities is unpredictable andrevenues from such activities could vary significantly from period to period.The third quarter and first nine months of 1995 included losses of $36 millionand $86 million, respectively, related to the disposition of emerging marketavailable-for-sale securities. Such dispositions are part of the Corporation'songoing efforts to manage its exposure in its available-for-saleportfolios. The comparable periods in 1994 included net gains of $80 million and$125 million, respectively, from sales of emerging markets past-due interest bonds. - 26 - Part IItem 2 (continued)NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense in the 1995 third quarter was $1,257 million, compared with$1,248 million in the 1995 second quarter and $1,311 million in the thirdquarter of 1994. For the first nine months, noninterest expense was $3,751million in 1995, compared with $3,868 million in 1994 (exclusive of a $48million restructuring charge). The improvement from the prior year reflects thebenefits of various expense-reduction efforts as part of the Corporation'sactions to improve earnings per share and a reduced Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation ("FDIC") premium expense in the 1995 third quarter of approximately$42 million (which included a FDIC refund of $39 million). Additionally, as aresult of the shareholder services joint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation,approximately $48 million of expenses for the first nine months of 1995 wererecorded on an equity basis within noninterest revenue. The decrease innoninterest expense was partially offset by the inclusion of $53 million of noninterest expenses in the first six months of 1995 relating to Margaretten,which was acquired in July 1994.The increases in salaries for the 1995 third quarter and first nine months wereprimarily due to higher incentive costs as a result of stronger earnings and thevesting of various stock-based incentive plans due to the improvement in theCorporation's stock price. For the first nine months of 1995, additional staff costs resulting from the 1994 Margaretten acquisition and the continuedgrowth in the Corporation's securities underwriting business also contributed to the increases. Partially offsetting these increases were the impact of personnel reductions undertaken in 1995 and lower salaries expense as a result of the equity accounting for the joint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation. Total full-time equivalent staff at September 30, 1995 amountedto 40,695, compared with the 1994 year-end level of 42,130 and the September 30,1994 level of 42,492. At September 30, 1995, the Corporation had eliminated approximately 2,300 of the 3,700 positions that it had targeted for eliminationas part of its actions to improve earnings per share announced in December 1994.Occupancy expense in the 1995 third quarter and first nine months decreased by$14 million and $36 million, respectively, from the prior year's comparableperiods. The declines for both periods are largely the result of theconsolidation of headquarters, operational and branch facilities and otherexpense-reduction initiatives. The nine month decline was partially offset bythe inclusion of Margaretten's expense since the acquisition date.The lower level of equipment expense in the 1995 third quarter was primarily theresult of expense reduction initiatives relating to rentals and other equipmentexpenses. The equipment expense per quarter has decreased from its highest levelat $107 million in the fourth quarter of 1994. For the first nine months of1995, the higher level of equipment expense was due to continued technologyenhancements to support the Corporation's investment in certain key businesses(in particular its trading and consumer banking businesses) and the inclusion ofMargaretten's results subsequent to the July 1, 1994 acquisition.There was no net foreclosed property expense in the 1995 third quarter comparedwith an expense of $2 million in the third quarter of 1994. For the first ninemonths, foreclosed property expense was a credit of $21 million in 1995,compared with an expense of $39 million in 1994. The decreases reflectsignificant progress in managing the Corporation's real estate portfolio.Included in the 1995 amounts were payments received at Texas Commerce EquityHoldings Inc. ("Texas Commerce") related to certain foreclosed propertiespreviously written down. - 27 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the components of other expense for the periodsindicated.Other expense for the 1995 third quarter was $309 million, a decrease of $73million, or 19%, from the same period in 1994. For the first nine months of1995, other expense decreased $125 million when compared with 1994. The 1995nine month amount included an additional six months of operating costs ofapproximately $28 million relating to Margaretten and excluded approximately $18million of expenses relating to the joint venture with Mellon Bank Corporation.FDIC assessments for the first nine months of 1995 decreased 43% compared withthe comparable 1994 period as a result of a $39 million refund received in thethird quarter of 1995 due to reduced FDIC assessment rates. All other expenses,which includes various smaller expense categories such as stationery, operatinglosses, postage, shipping, travel and insurance, decreased by $59 million, or11%, in the first nine months of 1995, primarily as a result of theCorporation's sourcing and other expense-reduction initiatives.The Corporation's efficiency ratio improved to 57.8% in the 1995 third quarter,compared with 62.9% in the same 1994 period. This ratio for the first ninemonths of 1995 was 60.4%, compared with 62.1% for the first nine months of 1994.The computation of the efficiency ratio (noninterest expense as a percentage ofthe total of net interest income and noninterest revenue) excludes anyrestructuring charges, foreclosed property expense, emerging markets-relatedpast-due interest bond sales and the gain from the sale of the Corporation's investment in Far East Bank and Trust Company. The Corporationremains committed to improving its operating margins and return levels and toachieving an efficiency ratio of 60% in 1995 and 57% in 1996.The Corporation is managing its expenses in line with its revenue opportunitiesand is benefiting from the implementation of its expense-reduction initiativesannounced and undertaken on December 1, 1994. As a result, the Corporationcurrently believes it is in a position to achieve the efficiency ratio and otherperformance goals announced on December 1, 1994 and that 1995 and 1996noninterest expense will be approximately equal to or less than 1994 noninterestexpense.INCOME TAXESThe Corporation recorded income tax expense of $318 million in the 1995 thirdquarter, compared with $311 million in the comparable 1994 period. For the firstnine months, the Corporation recorded income tax expense of $884 million in1995, compared with $791 million in 1994. The Corporation's effective tax ratewas 40.0% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 1995, compared with41.5% in the respective 1994 periods. - 28 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------BUSINESS ORGANIZATION- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Corporation conducts domestic and international financial servicesbusinesses through various bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The principal banksubsidiaries of the Corporation are Chemical Bank and Texas Commerce BankNational Association.LINES-OF-BUSINESS RESULTSProfitability of the Corporation is tracked with an internal managementinformation system that produces lines-of- business performance for all sectors.A set of management accounting policies has been developed and implemented toensure that the reported results of the groups reflect the economics of theirbusinesses. Lines- of-business results are subject to restatement as appropriatewhenever there are refinements in management reporting policies or changes tothe management organization. Thus, certain amounts reported in theprior periods have been restated to conform with the presentation of the currentquarter's results. Lines-of-business results are subject to further restatementsas may be necessary to reflect future changes in internal management reporting.Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred by thebusinesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating shareholders'equity and the provision for losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology.Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to the businessunits except for special corporate one-time charges. Management has developed arisk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different types of risk --credit, operating and market -- within various businesses and assigns capitalaccordingly. Credit risk is computed using a risk grading system that isconsistently applied throughout the Corporation. A long-term expected tax rateis assigned in evaluating the Corporation's businesses.Commencing with the first quarter of 1995, Texas Commerce has been reported on amanagement accounting basis instead of a legal entity basis. The 1994 resultsfor Texas Commerce have been restated to conform to the 1995 presentation. Theresults for Texas Commerce are included within the results of Consumer andRelationship Banking. - 29 -  - 30 -  - 31 - Part IItem 2 (continued)GLOBAL BANKThe Global Bank is organized into three principal management units: GlobalBanking & Investment Banking (client management, loan syndications and portfolioinvestments; high-yield finance, venture capital; mergers and acquisitions andother advisory services); Global Markets (foreign exchange dealing; derivativestrading and structuring, risk management and sales; securities structuring,underwriting, trading and sales; and management of the Corporation's funding andsecurities investment activities); and Regional Centers (all wholesale banking;investment banking; capital markets and other activities outside of the UnitedStates and the major cross-border financial centers). The Global Bank seeks tooptimize its risk profile and profitability by emphasizing originations,underwriting, distribution and risk management products.The Global Bank's net income in the third quarter was $254 million, an increaseof $42 million from the third quarter of 1994. The sector's return on equity inthe third quarter of 1995 was 25.9%, compared with 20.1% in the 1994 thirdquarter. The improvement in the 1995 third quarter results was primarily due toincreases in noninterest revenue from corporate finance and syndication fees, aswell as securities gains. The Global Bank's net income of $734 million andreturn on equity of 25.0% for the first nine months of 1995 increased from lastyear's nine month results of $602 million and 18.9%, respectively. The increasein the 1995 nine month results reflects higher corporate finance and syndicationfees, the gain related to the sale of the Corporation's investment in Far EastBank and Trust Company and securities gains, partially offset by lower tradingrevenue.The following table sets forth the significant components of Global Bank's totalrevenue by business for the periods indicated.Revenue for Global Banking & Investment Banking increased in the 1995 thirdquarter and the first nine months of 1995 by $81 million and $240 million,respectively, when compared with the same periods in 1994. The increases in both1995 periods when compared with last year were primarily due to higher feerevenue as a result of the Corporation's leading market share in the loansyndication business and increased revenue from equity-related investments.Revenue for Global Markets increased in the 1995 third quarter when comparedwith the same period last year primarily due to higher securities gains of $43million, partially offset by lower trading revenues of $13 million. For thefirst nine months of 1995, the decline in revenue when compared with the sameperiod last year is attributable to the $189 million decrease in trading revenuereflecting unexpected volatility of interest rates in the foreign tradingmarkets. The decrease in revenue from last year was also affected by lower netinterest income due to higher short-term interest rates in 1995.Revenue for Regional Centers was essentially flat for the third quarter of 1995when compared with last year's third quarter. For the first nine months of 1995,revenue for Regional Centers increased $140 million compared with 1994.Increased commercial loan volume and improved interest rate environments,primarily in Latin America, increased net interest income by $27 million for thefirst nine months of 1995, when compared with the same period last year. Tradingrevenue increased $18 million primarily in the European regional centers. Alsocontributing to the increase in revenue for the first nine months of 1995 wasthe gain related to the sale of the Corporation's interest in Far East Bank andTrust Company. - 32 - Part IItem 2 (continued)CONSUMER AND RELATIONSHIP BANKINGConsumer and Relationship Banking includes Metropolitan Banking (consumerbanking and commercial and professional banking); Retail Card Services; MortgageBank; National Consumer Finance (home secured lending, student lending, andother consumer lending); Middle Market (regional commercial banking); PrivateBanking; Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc.; Geoserve (cash management, fundstransfer, trade, corporate trust and securities services worldwide); and TexasCommerce. The Corporation maintains a leading market share position in servingthe financial needs of middle market commercial enterprises and small businessesin the New York metropolitan area. Private Banking serves a high net-worthclientele with banking, advisory and investment services. Texas Commerce is aleader in providing financial products and services to businesses andindividuals throughout Texas and is the primary bank for more large corporationsand middle market companies than any other bank in Texas.On October 6, 1995, the Corporation sold Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. toPNC Bank Corp. The transaction is not reflected in the Corporation's thirdquarter results. The sale did not include Chemical's franchise in northeasternNew Jersey, where it retains 39 branches and its private banking operations.The net income for Consumer and Relationship Banking was $228 million in thethird quarter of 1995, an increase from last year's third quarter results of$182 million. The increase in earnings was due to lower noninterest expense of$78 million relating to the reduced FDIC premium expense coupled with thepositive effects of the margin improvement program and higher noninterestrevenue of $13 million, partially offset by higher credit provision of $24million.For the first nine months of 1995, Consumer and Relationship Banking's netincome was $590 million, an increase of $81 million from the same period lastyear. The results for the first nine months of 1994 included a $48 millionrestructuring charge ($28 million after-tax) related to the closing of 50 NewYork branches and a staff reduction of 650. Excluding the restructuring charge,Consumer and Relationship Banking's earnings for the first nine months of 1995increased by $53 million, when compared with the first nine months of 1994, dueto lower noninterest expense of $80 million, higher noninterest revenue of $39million and lower foreclosed property expense of $19 million, partially offsetby higher credit provision of $47 million. The higher credit provision for the first nine months of 1995 reflects the substantial growth in credit cardoutstandings.The following table sets forth the significant components of Consumer andRelationship Banking's total revenue by business for the periods indicated.Metropolitan Banking had revenue of $270 million in the 1995 third quarter,which was essentially flat with the 1994 third quarter. For the first ninemonths of 1995, Metropolitan Bank experienced revenue growth of $64 million, or8%, compared with 1994. The improvement in 1995 compared with last year'sresults was due mainly to favorable deposit spreads, targeted customersegmentation and repricing initiatives. - 33 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Retail Card Services revenue increased $36 million, or 14%, in the 1995 thirdquarter and $70 million, or 9%, for the first nine months of 1995, compared withthe same periods in 1994. An increase in Shell MasterCard outstandings andresulting strong fee growth contributed to the increases in revenue. Totaloutstandings for Retail Card Services at the end of the third quarter were $10.7billion compared with $8.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 1994.The Mortgage Bank continues to be faced with fierce competition due to industryovercapacity and higher interest rates, which have adversely affected productionmargins and origination volume in both 1995 and 1994. During the first nine months of 1995, the Mortgage Bank increased revenues, when compared with thefirst nine months of 1994, due to higher servicing-related revenues as a resultof the acquisition of Margaretten.National Consumer Finance revenues have remained relatively stable in the thirdquarter and first nine months of 1995, when compared with the 1994 third quarterand first nine months. National Consumer Finance outstandings have increased inthe third quarter of 1995 by more than 20% over the third quarter of 1994;partially offsetting this favorable impact was a reduction in spreads.Middle Market revenues were essentially flat for the third quarter and firstnine months of 1995, when compared with the same periods in 1994. Middle Markethas experienced improved credit quality and favorable deposit spreads in 1995;however, loan spreads and deposit volumes have decreased primarily due toheightened competition coupled with the higher interest rate environment.Private Banking revenue increased $11 million, or 14%, in the 1995 third quarterand $9 million, or 4%, for the first nine months of 1995, compared with the sameperiods in 1994. Private Banking revenue for the first nine months of 1995includes the adverse impact of a $13 million loss from the permanent impairment of Barings Bank PLC securities. Excluding this loss, Private Banking's revenues for the first nine months of 1995 would have reflected a 9% increase over thesame period in 1994. These positive results are attributable to continued loanand deposit growth, wider deposit spreads and higher fees generated by greatervolume in the brokerage business for the third quarter and the first nine monthsof 1995.Revenue in Geoserve increased $5 million in the 1995 third quarter, a 3%increase from the 1994 third quarter. The increase in revenue reflects an 8%increase experienced by treasury management products, partially offset by adecline in global securities and trust revenue.Texas Commerce revenue increased $11 million, or 4%, in the 1995 third quarterand $21 million, or 3%, for the first nine months of 1995, compared with thesame periods in 1994. The improvements in both 1995 periods were due to highernet interest income resulting from growth in loan volume and more favorableinterest rate spreads. Also contributing to the increase in earnings for thefirst nine months of 1995 was lower foreclosed property expense. The substantial decrease in foreclosed property expense is attributableto the improvement in the Texas real estate market and payments received relatedto certain foreclosed properties that were previously written down.TERMINAL BUSINESSES (LDC AND REAL ESTATE)Terminal Businesses represent discontinued portfolios which are primarilyrefinancing country debt and the Corporation's commercial real estatenonperforming portfolio, primarily at Chemical Bank. Terminal businesses had netlosses of $30 million for the third quarter of 1995 and $43 million for thefirst nine months of 1995, compared with net income of $40 million and $12million, respectively, for the same periods in 1994. The unfavorable 1995results were primarily due to losses of $36 million in the 1995 third quarterand $86 million for the first nine months of 1995 related to the disposition ofavailable-for-sale emerging markets securities compared with gains from emergingmarkets securities of $80 million in the 1994 third quarter and $125 million inthe first nine months of 1994. Net interest income decreased $5 million in the third quarter of 1995 and $33 million for the first nine months of 1995 due to a decline in loan outstandings. The improvements in credit provisionand foreclosed property expense compared with last year reflects the significant progress made in managing the Corporation's real estate portfolio.Total nonperforming assets at September 30, 1995 were $286 million, down $845 million from $1,131 million at September 30, 1994. - 34 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The improvement in nonperforming asset levels from last year is the result ofincreased liquidity in the real estate markets and successful workoutactivities, coupled with the strategic actions taken during 1994. For moreinformation regarding such actions, reference is made to page B26 of theCorporation's 1994 Form 10-K.CORPORATECorporate includes the management results attributed to the parent company; theCorporation's investment in CIT; and some effects remaining at the corporatelevel after the implementation of management accounting policies, includingresidual credit provision and tax expense. Corporate had net income of $25million for the 1995 third quarter and net income of $34 million for the firstnine months of 1995, compared with net income of $5 million and a net loss of $8million, respectively, for the corresponding 1994 periods. Included in the netincome for the first nine months of 1995 was an $11 million after-tax charge due to the adoption of SFAS 106 for foreign employees and a $6 millionwritedown associated with certain nonperforming residential mortgages.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------LOAN PORTFOLIO- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following loan review discussion focuses primarily on developments sinceDecember 31, 1994 and should be read in conjunction with the Loan Portfoliosection on pages B25 through B30 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 1994 (the "1994 Form 10-K").The Corporation's loans outstanding totaled $85.6 billion at September 30, 1995,an increase of $6.9 billion from year-end 1994 and an increase of $8.5 billion,or 11%, from September 30, 1994. The growth in loans outstanding reflectsincreases in both the consumer and commercial and industrial loan portfolioswith growth rates of 29% and 4%, respectively, over the past twelve months. Forthe remainder of 1995, the Corporation expects continued growth in its loanportfolio.The Corporation's loan balances were as follows for the dates indicated: - 35 - Part IItem 2 (continued)NONPERFORMING ASSETSFor a description of the Corporation's accounting policies for its nonperformingloans, renegotiated loans and assets acquired as loan satisfactions, see NoteOne of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page B49 of theCorporation's 1994 Form 10-K.The following table sets forth the nonperforming assets and contractuallypast-due loans of the Corporation at September 30, 1995, December 31, 1994 andSeptember 30, 1994.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at September 30, 1995 were $1,047million, a decrease of $92 million from the 1994 year-end level and a decreaseof $1,146 million, or 52%, from last year's comparable quarter. The reduction innonperforming assets reflects the improvement in the Corporation's creditprofile as a result of a lower level of loans being placed on nonperformingstatus, repayments, charge-offs, the Corporation's continuing loan workout andcollection activities, as well as the impact of several strategic actionsundertaken during 1994.Management expects the level of the Corporation's nonperforming assets atyear-end 1995 will be comparable with the level at 1994 year-end. - 36 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the reconciliation of nonperforming assets for thethird quarter and first nine months of 1995 and 1994.ASSETS HELD FOR ACCELERATED DISPOSITIONIn December 1994, the Corporation segregated approximately $735 million of realestate loans and real estate owned (approximately $580 million nonperformingassets) and designated such assets as Assets Held for Accelerated Disposition.In conjunction with the transfer of these real estate loans to the held foraccelerated disposition classification, the Corporation reevaluated its carryingvalues for these assets to facilitate their rapid disposition and recorded acharge of $148 million to the allowance for credit losses. As a result of thisaction, these assets were excluded from the September 30, 1995 and December 31,1994 nonperforming assets category.The following table represents the Corporation's assets held for accelerateddisposition at the dates indicated: - 37 - Part IItem 2 (continued)For a discussion of net charge-offs, see the various credit portfolio sectionsthat follow. Management expects that net charge-offs in the 1995 fourth quarter will be generally comparable with the 1995 third quarter level.DOMESTIC CONSUMER PORTFOLIOThe domestic consumer loan portfolio consists of one-to-four family residentialmortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans. The domestic consumer loanportfolio totaled $36.7 billion at September 30, 1995, representing 43% of totalloans, an increase from $30.1 billion, or 38% of total loans, at December 31,1994 and an increase from $28.5 billion, or 37% of total loans, at September 30,1994.Residential mortgage loans at September 30, 1995 increased $5.0 billion from thecomparable 1994 period-end, due in part to increases in adjustable-rate loanoutstandings as well as the acquisition of residential mortgage loans in thesecond quarter of 1995. Credit card receivables at September 30, 1995 increased$2.4 billion from the same date a year ago, primarily due to the co-brandedShell MasterCard program. Management expects continued growth in the level ofShell credit card outstandings for the fourth quarter of 1995. Management isexploring other opportunities in the credit card area, including otherco-branded card programs.Total nonperforming domestic consumer loans were $136 million at September 30,1995, $104 million at December 31, 1994 and $170 million at September 30, 1994.The increase in nonperforming domestic consumer loans since December 31, 1994 islargely due to the increase in the volume of consumer loans.Domestic consumer loan balances are expected to continue to increase in thefourth quarter of 1995, particularly in the credit card portfolio despite a$1.5 billion credit card securitization in the 1995 fourth quarter. As aresult of this anticipated growth, management expects consumer loan net charge-offs in 1996 will be higher than in 1995. - 38 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the composition of the Corporation's delinquentdomestic consumer loans that are contractually past-due 90 days or more at thedates indicated but are still accruing. Such consumer loans are generally notclassified as nonperforming but, rather, are charged off on a formula basis.MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIESThe Corporation both originates and services residential mortgage loans as partof its mortgage banking activities. After origination, the Corporation typicallysells loans to investors, primarily in the secondary market, while retaining therights to service such loans. The Corporation originated $4.3 billion ofresidential mortgages in the third quarter of 1995 versus $3.2 billion in thecomparable period in 1994. For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, theCorporation originated $9.2 billion of residential mortgages, compared with$10.2 billion in the same 1994 period. During the first nine months of 1995, theCorporation sold to investors approximately 65% of the residential mortgageloans it had originated, compared with 75% in same 1994 period. TheCorporation's residential mortgage servicing portfolio amounted to $52.6 billionat September 30, 1995.In addition to originating mortgage servicing rights, the Corporation alsopurchases and sells mortgage servicing rights. The Corporation may purchase bulkrights to service a loan portfolio or the Corporation may purchase loansdirectly and then sell such loans while retaining the servicing rights. Asdisclosed in Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q, theCorporation adopted SFAS 122 in the 1995 second quarter. SFAS 122 requires thatwhen a definitive plan exists to sell or securitize mortgage loans and retainthe servicing rights related thereto, a mortgage banking enterprise shouldrecognize as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others,irrespective of whether those servicing rights are acquired through the purchaseor origination of mortgage loans.Mortgage servicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $467 million atSeptember 30, 1995, compared with $469 million at December 31, 1994 and $473million at September 30, 1994. The decrease from the September 30, 1994 levelreflected the effects of amortization and sales of mortgage servicing rights.The Corporation utilizes an amortization method based on adjusted cash flows toamortize mortgage servicing rights. The mortgage loans to which theCorporation's servicing rights relate are, to a substantial degree, of recentvintage (i.e., originated in the period 1992 through the first half of 1994 wheninterest rates were relatively low). The Corporation continually evaluatesprepayment exposure of the portfolio, adjusting the balance and remaining lifeof the servicing rights as a result of prepayments. - 39 - Part IItem 2 (continued)DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIOThe domestic commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $21.7 billion atSeptember 30, 1995, an increase from $20.8 billion at each of December 31, 1994and September 30, 1994. The portfolio is diversified geographically and byindustry. The largest industry concentrations are oil and gas and retailingwhich approximate $1.9 billion (or 2.2% of total loans) and $1.8 billion (or2.1% of total loans), respectively. All of the other remaining industries areeach less than 2% of total loans.Included in the domestic commercial and industrial portfolio are loans relatedto highly leveraged transactions ("HLTs"). The Corporation originates andsyndicates loans in HLTs, which include acquisitions, leveraged buyouts andrecapitalizations. HLT loans at September 30, 1995 totaled approximately $1.5billion, compared with $1.3 billion at the 1994 year-end and $1.5 billion atSeptember 30, 1994. The increase in the HLT loan portfolio from the 1994year-end level reflects a rise in the number of HLT transactions during 1995. AtSeptember 30, 1995, the Corporation had $19 million in nonperforming HLT loans,compared with $82 million at the end of 1994 and $131 million at September 30,1994. Net recoveries related to HLTs for the first nine months of 1995 totaled$12 million, compared with $13 million in the comparable 1994 period.The Corporation is a leading participant in loan originations and sales. Thisactivity is comprised of the sale of loans and lending commitments to investors,generally without recourse. These sales include syndication, assignment andparticipation, and include both short- and medium-term transactions. This loandistribution capability allows the Corporation to compete aggressively andprofitably in wholesale lending markets by enabling it to reduce largerindividual credit exposures and thereby to price more flexibly than if all loanswere held as permanent investments. The Corporation also benefits from increasedliquidity. During the first nine months of 1995, the Corporation acted as agentor co-agent for approximately $282 billion in syndicated credit facilities,compared with $263 billion in the same period last year.DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATEThe domestic commercial real estate portfolio represents loans secured primarilyby real property, other than loans secured by one-to-four family residentialproperties (which are included in the consumer loan portfolio). The domesticcommercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $5.2 billion at September 30,1995, a decrease from $5.7 billion at December 31, 1994 and from $6.4 billion atSeptember 30, 1994. The decreases are attributable to repayments, thedesignation of certain real estate assets for accelerated disposition inDecember 1994, a bulk asset sale in October 1994, transfers to real estateowned, and charge-offs.The table below sets forth the major components of the domestic commercial realestate loan portfolio at the dates indicated.Commercial mortgages provide financing for the acquisition or refinancing ofcommercial properties, and typically have terms ranging from two-to-five years.Construction loans are generally originated to finance the construction of realestate projects. When the real estate project has cash flows sufficient tosupport a commercial mortgage, the loan is transferred from construction statusto commercial mortgage status.The largest concentration of domestic commercial real estate loans is in the NewYork/New Jersey and Texas markets, representing 44% and 28%, respectively, ofthe domestic commercial real estate portfolio. No other state represented morethan 2% of the domestic commercial real estate loan portfolio. - 40 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate assets were $230 million atSeptember 30, 1995, an 8% decrease from December 31, 1994 and a decrease of $878million, or 79%, from September 30, 1994. The improvement in nonperformingdomestic commercial real estate asset levels since September 30, 1994 is theresult of increased liquidity in the commercial real estate markets coupled withsuccessful workout activities, as well as the aforementioned strategic actionstaken during 1994.During the first nine months of 1995, the Corporation recorded a $25 million netrecovery of writedowns as a result of payments received on certain foreclosedproperties which had been previously written down. Writedowns on commercial realestate owned in the first nine months of 1994 totaled $48 million.Domestic commercial real estate net charge-offs in the third quarter of 1995totaled $11 million, compared with $20 million in the same period a year ago.For the first nine months, such net charge-offs were $39 million in 1995,compared with $143 million in 1994. The lower net charge-offs are due in part tothe decision in December 1994 to designate certain real estate assets foraccelerated disposition.Domestic commercial real estate net charge-offs and writedowns for the full year1995 are expected to be below the full year 1994 levels.DOMESTIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PORTFOLIOThe domestic financial institutions portfolio includes commercial banks andcompanies whose businesses primarily involve lending, financing, investing,underwriting, or insurance. Loans to domestic financial institutions were $4.2billion at September 30, 1995, or 5% of total loans outstanding. Loans todomestic financial institutions are predominantly to broker-dealers, whichcomprise approximately half the domestic financial institutions total.FOREIGN PORTFOLIOThe foreign portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, loans tofinancial institutions, commercial real estate, loans to governments andofficial institutions, and consumer loans. At September 30, 1995, theCorporation's total foreign loans were $17.9 billion, compared with $18.3billion at December 31, 1994, and $18.4 billion at September 30, 1994.Included in foreign loans were foreign commercial and industrial loans of $8.4billion at September 30, 1995, an increase of $.8 billion from the 1994 year-endand an increase of $1.0 billion from September 30, 1994. Total foreigncommercial real estate loans at September 30, 1995 were $.6 billion, a slightincrease from each of December 31, 1994 and September 30, 1994. A significantportion of the foreign real estate portfolio is located in the United Kingdomand Hong Kong.MEXICOFor a discussion of significant developments with respect to Mexican debt, seepage B29 of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K.At September 30, 1995, the Corporation's total exposure to Mexico was $1,236million, which is largely trade and short-term credits. This excludes bondsreceived as part of debt renegotiations (i.e., Brady Bonds) with a face value of$1,565 million and current carrying value of $1,424 million, which arecollateralized by zero-coupon United States Treasury obligations. - 41 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------In the normal course of its business, the Corporation utilizes variousderivative and foreign exchange financial instruments to meet the financingneeds of its customers, to generate revenues through its trading activities, andto manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates.Derivative and foreign exchange instruments represent contracts withcounterparties where payments are made to or from the counterparty based uponspecific interest rates, currency levels, other market rates, or on termspredetermined by the contract. These instruments can provide a cost-effectivealternative to assuming and mitigating risks associated with traditionalon-balance sheet instruments. Derivative and foreign exchange transactionsinvolve, to varying degrees, credit risk (i.e., the possibility that a loss mayoccur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the termsof a contract) and market risk (i.e., the possibility that a change in interestor currency rates will cause the value of a financial instrument to decrease orbecome more costly to settle).The effective management of credit and market risk is vital to the success ofthe Corporation's trading activities and asset/liability management. Because ofthe changing market environment, the monitoring and managing of these risks is acontinual process. For a further discussion, see the Risk Management sectionbelow.The Corporation does not deal, to any material extent, in derivatives whichdealers of derivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions) considerto be "complex" (i.e., exotic and/or leveraged). As a result, the notionalamount of such derivatives were less than 0.5% of the Corporation's totalnotional amount of derivative contracts at September 30, 1995.A discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instrumentsutilized in connection with the Corporation's trading activities andasset/liability management activities is provided on pages B31 and B34-B36 ofthe Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K, Notes 3, 12 and 14 of this Form 10-Q and theRisk Management section on pages B31-B37 of the Corporation's 1994 Form 10-K andbelow.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------RISK MANAGEMENT- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTCredit risk exists for both lending-related products and derivative and foreignexchange products. Under the direction of the Chief Credit Officer, riskpolicies are formulated, approved and communicated throughout the Corporation.The Credit Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chief Credit Officer, isresponsible for maintaining a sound credit process, addressing risk issues, andreviewing the portfolio.The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchange producttransactions with regulated financial institutions, which the Corporationbelieves have relatively low credit risk. At September 30, 1995, approximately93% of the mark-to-market exposure of the Corporation's derivative and foreign exchange transactions were with commercial bank and financial institution counterparties, most of which are dealers in these products. Non-financialinstitutions only accounted for approximately 7% of the Corporation's derivativeand foreign exchange mark-to-market exposure.Many of the Corporation's contracts are short-term, which mitigates credit riskas transactions settle quickly. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September30, 1995 and December 31, 1994. Percentages are based upon remaining contractlife of mark-to-market exposure amounts. For the notional amounts and creditexposure outstandings of the Corporation's interest rate contracts and foreignexchange contracts, see Note 12 of this Form 10-Q. - 42 - Part IItem 2 (continued)ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses is available to absorb potential credit lossesfrom the entire loan portfolio as well as on-balance sheet derivative and foreign exchange transactions. The Corporation deems its allowance for creditlosses at September 30, 1995 to be adequate. Although the Corporation considers that it has sufficient reserves to absorb losses that may currently exist in the portfolio, but are not yet identifiable, the precise loss contentis subject to continuing review based on quality indicators, industry andgeographic concentrations, changes in business conditions, and other externalfactors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. TheCorporation will continue to reassess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from derivative and foreignexchange transactions were immaterial during the first nine months of 1995 and1994. Additionally, at September 30, 1995 and 1994, nonperforming derivativescontracts were immaterial.The accompanying table reflects the activity in the allowance for credit lossesfor the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1995 and 1994. - 43 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the Corporation's allowance coverage ratios atSeptember 30, 1995, December 31, 1994 and September 30, 1994.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT - TRADING ACTIVITIESThe effects of market gains or losses on the Corporation's trading activitieshave been reflected in trading revenue, as the trading instruments aremarked-to-market on a daily basis. For the impact of any unrecognized marketgains or losses on the Corporation's asset/liability management portfolio, seeNote 14 of this Form 10-Q.Measuring Market Risk: One of the risk controls the Corporation utilizes in itsoverall risk management process is value-at-risk. The Corporation definesvalue-at-risk as the potential overnight dollar loss from adverse marketmovements that would cover 97.5% of likely market movements, which aredetermined by using two years of historical price and rate data. TheCorporation's value-at-risk calculations employ over 3,100 volatilities and 1.24million correlations (updated quarterly) of various market instruments. TheCorporation monitors value-at- risk figures for major business units on a dailybasis to ensure the potential for market loss is properly reflected. Themethodology generally used to offset positions within a business unit is deemedby the Corporation to be conservative. Only partial credit for correlationbetween instruments within each business unit is incorporated since correlationscan exhibit instability during volatile market environments. Aggregating acrossbusiness units with no correlation offset resulted in an aggregated dailyaverage value-at-risk figure of $29 million for the twelve months endedSeptember 30, 1995. Based on actual trading results for the twelve months endedSeptember 30, 1995, which capture the historical correlation among businessunits, the Corporation's daily value-at-risk was reduced to approximately $7million with 97.5% confidence.For the twelve months ended September 30, 1995, the Corporation posted positivedaily market risk-related revenue for 212 out of 267 business trading days forinternational and domestic units. For 136 of the 267 days, the Corporation'sdaily market risk-related revenue or losses centered around the $0 million to $5million range, which is representative of the Corporation's emphasis onmarket-making and sales activities. The low number of outlier results (13 dayshaving positive or negative market risk-related revenues exceeding $10 million)exemplifies the Corporation's diversified approach to market risk management asa business strategy.OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENTThe Corporation, like all institutions, is subject to the risk of fraud and tothe risk of unauthorized activities by employees. The Corporation believes itmaintains a comprehensive system of internal controls designed to manage andcontrol such operating risks.In December 1994, the Corporation suffered a trading loss of approximately $40million (after tax). The loss was the result of the Mexican peso fallingprecipitously in value at a time when a currency trader at Chemical Bank had alarge, unauthorized long position in the peso, which he had hidden from hissuperiors. After that incident the Corporation conducted a review of variouscontrols associated with its trading activities and tightened controls inseveral areas. Among other things, the respective responsibilities of traders,trading supervisors and operations personnel were more clearly defined, andadditional procedures for confirming trades and following up on unconfirmedtrades were put in place. - 44 - Part IItem 2 (continued)ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTThe objective of the asset/liability management process is to manage and controlthe sensitivity of the Corporation's income to changes in market interest rates.The Corporation's net interest income is affected by changes in the level ofmarket interest rates based upon mismatches between the repricing of its assetsand liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity arises in the ordinary course of theCorporation's banking business as the repricing characteristics of its loans donot necessarily match those of its deposits and other borrowings. Thissensitivity can be altered by adjusting the Corporation's investments and thematurities of its wholesale funding activities, and with the use of off-balancesheet derivative instruments. For a further discussion of the Corporation'sasset/liability management process and the variety of techniques used to measureits interest rate sensitivity, see pages B34-B36 of the Corporation's 1994 Form10-K.MEASURING INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY:Management uses a variety of techniques to measure its interest ratesensitivity. One such tool is aggregate net gap analysis, an example of which ispresented below. Assets and liabilities are placed in maturity ladders based ontheir contractual maturities or repricing dates. Assets and liabilities forwhich no specific contractual maturity or repricing dates exist are placed inladders based on management's judgments concerning their most likely repricingbehaviors.A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilitiesrepricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negative gap - moreliabilities repricing than assets - will benefit net interest income in adeclining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income ina rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positive gap - more assetsrepricing than liabilities - will benefit net interest income if rates arerising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment.At September 30, 1995, the Corporation had $13,291 million more liabilities thanassets repricing within one year, amounting to 7.1% of total assets. Thiscompares with $9,118 million, or 5.3%, of total assets at December 31, 1994. - 45 - Part IItem 2 (continued)At September 30, 1995, based on the Corporation's simulation models, which arecomprehensive simulations of net interest income under a variety of marketinterest rate scenarios, net interest income sensitivity to a gradual 150 basispoint rise in market rates over the next twelve months was estimated at slightlyless than 5% of projected after-tax net income. At December 31, 1994, theCorporation's interest rate sensitivity to a similar increase in market rateswas estimated at 3%.Interest Rate Swaps: Interest rate swaps are one of the various financialinstruments used in the Corporation's asset/liability management activities.Although the Corporation believes the results of its asset/liability managementactivities should be evaluated on an integrated basis, taking into considerationall on- and related off-balance sheet instruments and not a specific financialinstrument, the interest rate swap maturity table, which follows, provides anindication of the Corporation's interest rate swap activity.The table below summarizes maturities and weighted-average interest rates to bereceived and paid on domestic and international interest rate swaps utilized inthe Corporation's asset/liability management at September 30, 1995. The tablewas prepared under the assumption that variable interest rates remain constantat September 30, 1995 levels and, accordingly, the actual interest rates to bereceived or paid will be different to the extent that such variable ratesfluctuate from September 30, 1995 levels. Variable rates presented are generallybased on the short-term interest rates for relevant currencies (e.g., LondonInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)). Basis swaps are interest rate swaps based ontwo floating rate indices (e.g., LIBOR and prime). Forward starting swaps areinterest rate swap contracts that become effective at a future time. - 46 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following capital and liquidity discussion focuses primarily on developmentssince December 31, 1994. Accordingly, it should be read in conjunction with theCapital and Liquidity section on pages B37-B40 of the Corporation's 1994 Form10-K.The Corporation's capital base at September 30, 1995 remained strong, withcapital ratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Corporation's Tier 1and Total Capital ratios were 7.9% and 11.5%, respectively. Total capitalization (the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital) increased by $817 million during the first nine months of 1995.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYTotal stockholders' equity at September 30, 1995 was $11.8 billion, comparedwith $10.7 billion at December 31, 1994. The $1.1 billion increase from the 1994year-end primarily reflected net income generated during the first nine monthsof 1995 of $1,315 million and a $303 million favorable impact in the fair valueof available-for- sale securities accounted for under SFAS 115. These amountswere partially offset by common and preferred stock dividends totaling $435million and the Corporation's common stock buyback program. The market valuationof the available-for-sale securities does not include the impact of relatedfunding sources. For a further discussion of the Corporation's common stockrepurchase program, see Note 7 of this Form 10-Q.During the second quarter of 1995, the Corporation called all of the outstandingshares of its 10% convertible preferred stock for redemption. Substantially allof the 10% convertible preferred stock was converted prior to the redemptiondate, at the option of the holders thereof, into approximately 7.6 millionshares of the Corporation's common stock. The shares of common stock issued uponsuch conversion were issued from treasury.LONG-TERM DEBTThe Corporation's long-term debt at September 30, 1995 was $7,537 million, adecrease of $454 million from the 1994 year-end. The decrease resulted frommaturities of $1,218 million of the Corporation's long-term debt (including $499million of senior medium-term notes and $719 million of other senior notes) andthe redemption of $150 million of long-term debt. These decreases were partiallyoffset by additions to the Corporation's long-term debt of $913 million(including $250 million of senior medium-term notes, $240 million ofsubordinated medium-term notes and $423 million of other senior notes). See theLiquidity Management section for further discussion of the Corporation'slong-term debt.COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDSIn the second quarter of 1995, the Board of Directors of the Corporationincreased the quarterly dividend on outstanding shares of its common stock to$.50 per share, an increase of 14% from $.44 per share. On an annual basis, thisrepresents an increase in the dividend rate to $2.00 per common share, from$1.76 per common share. Future dividend policies will be determined by the Boardof Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Corporationand its subsidiaries and other factors, including applicable governmentalregulations and policies.RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOSAt September 30, 1995, the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratioswere 7.9% and 11.5%, respectively, well in excess of the minimum ratiosspecified by the Federal Reserve Board. These ratios, as well as the leverageratio discussed below, do not reflect any adjustment in stockholders' equity dueto the adoption of SFAS No. 115 and also exclude the assets and off-balancesheet financial instruments of the Corporation's securities subsidiary, ChemicalSecurities, Inc., as well as the Corporation's investment in this subsidiary. AtSeptember 30, 1995, Chemical Bank's Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were7.3% and 11.1%, respectively. At such date, all of the Corporation's bankinginstitutions were "well capitalized," as defined by the Federal Reserve Board.To be "well capitalized," a banking organization must have a Tier 1 Capitalratio of at least 6%, Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and Tier 1 leverageratio of at least 5%. - 47 - Part IItem 2 (continued)LEVERAGE RATIOSThe Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 Capital (as defined under therisk-based capital guidelines) divided by average total assets (net of allowancefor credit losses, goodwill and certain intangible assets). The minimum leverageratio is 3% for banking organizations that have well-diversified risk (includingno undue interest rate risk); excellent asset quality; high liquidity; goodearnings; and, in general, are considered strong banking organizations. Otherbanking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least 4%-5% dependingupon their particular condition and growth plans. Higher capital ratios could berequired if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a givenbanking organization. The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Corporationof any specific minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to it.The Corporation's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.24% at September 30, 1995,compared with 6.26% at December 31, 1994. At September 30, 1995, Chemical Bank'sTier 1 leverage ratio was 5.61%, compared with 5.72% at December 31, 1994.The table which follows sets forth the Corporation's risk based capital andcapital ratios for the dates indicated. - 48 - Part IItem 2 (continued)LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTThe primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the Corporationderives from their ability to generate core deposits (which includes alldeposits except noninterest-bearing time deposits, foreign deposits andcertificates of deposit of $100,000 or more). The Corporation considers fundsfrom such sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit base becauseof the historical stability of such sources of funds. The average core depositsat the Corporation's bank subsidiaries for the first nine months of 1995 were$55 billion, a decrease from $59 billion for the comparable 1994 period. Thesedeposits fund a portion of the Corporation's asset base, thereby reducing theCorporation's reliance on other, more volatile, sources of funds. Average coredeposits as a percentage of average loans were 67% for the nine months of 1995,compared with 79% for the same period a year ago.The Corporation is an active participant in the capital markets. In addition toissuing commercial paper and medium-term notes, the Corporation raises fundsthrough the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and preferred stock. Duringthe first nine months of 1995, the Corporation issued $913 million of long-termdebt, including $490 million through its medium-term note program.The following comments apply to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.Cash and due from banks decreased $1.7 billion during the first nine months of1995, as net cash used in investing activities exceeded the net cash provided byfinancing and operating activities. The $13.1 billion net cash used by investingactivities was primarily impacted by cash outflows from purchases of securities($48.6 billion) and from an increase in net loans ($7.1 billion), partiallyoffset by cash inflows from the sales and maturities of securities ($36.8billion and $5.5 billion, respectively). The $10.7 billion net cash provided byfinancing activities was primarily due to an increase in Federal fundspurchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds($11.6 billion), partially offset by a decrease in net long-term debt ($.5billion). The $.7 billion net cash provided by operating activities wasprincipally due to earnings adjusted for noncash charges and credits, partiallyoffset by an increase in trading-related assets. Cash and due from banks increased $1.2 billion during the first nine months of1994, as net cash provided by financing and operating activities exceeded netcash used by investing activities. The $3.6 billion net cash provided byfinancing activities was due to increases in Federal funds purchased, securitiessold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds ($8.8 billion) andforeign deposits ($3.3 billion), partially offset by decreases in domesticdeposits ($8.6 billion). The $1.9 billion of net cash provided by operatingactivities was principally due to earnings adjusted for noncash charges andcredits. The $4.3 billion net cash used in investing activities was largely theresult of cash outflows from purchases of securities ($18.8 billion), fromFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements ($2.6billion), and increases in net loans ($1.9 billion), partially offset by cashinflows from the sales and maturities of securities ($13.9 billion and $5.0billion, respectively), as well as decreases in deposits with banks ($0.8billion).The Corporation's anticipated cash requirements (on a parent company-only basis)for the remainder of 1995 include approximately $600 million for maturingmedium- and long-term debt, interest payments on its outstanding debt,anticipated dividend payments on the Corporation's common stock and preferredstock, the costs of the aforementioned $1.2 billion stock buyback program, andother parent company operations. The Corporation considers the sources ofliquidity available to the parent company to be more than sufficient to meet itsobligations. The sources of liquidity available to the Corporation (on a parentcompany-only basis) include its liquid assets (including deposits with its banksubsidiaries and short-term advances to and repurchase agreements with itssecurities subsidiaries) as well as dividends and the repayment of intercompanyadvances from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries. In addition, as of September30, 1995, the Corporation had available to it $750 million in committed creditfacilities from a syndicate of domestic and international banks. The facilitiesincluded a $450 million 48-month facility and a $300 million 364-day facility. - 49 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following supervision and regulation discussion focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1994. Accordingly, it should be read inconjunction with the Supervision and Regulation section on pages A2-A6 of theCorporation's 1994 Form 10-K.DIVIDENDSAt September 30, 1995, in accordance with the dividend restrictions applicableto them, the Corporation's bank subsidiaries could, during 1995, without theapproval of their relevant banking regulators, pay dividends of approximately$1.1 billion to their respective bank holding companies, plus an additionalamount equal to their net income from October 1, 1995 through the date in 1995of any such dividend payment.In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the Federal ReserveBoard, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have authorityunder the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit thepayment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including theCorporation and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if,in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute anunsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bankingorganization.FDICIAThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")requires the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC depositinsurance. FDICIA also contains provisions limiting certain activities andbusiness methods of depository institutions. Finally, FDICIA provides forexpanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, includingparent holding companies, by such institutions' appropriate Federal bankingregulator. Each of the Corporation's banking institutions were "wellcapitalized" as that term is defined under the various regulations promulgatedunder FDICIA and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect such regulations tohave a material adverse impact on their business operations.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER EVENTS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------JOINT VENTURE WITH MELLON BANK CORPORATIONThe Corporation and Mellon Bank Corporation have formed a joint venture thatprovides stock transfer and related shareholder services to publicly-held companies. The joint venture is called Chemical Mellon ShareholderServices, and is a 50/50 partnership, with Mellon Bank Corporation and theCorporation sharing equally in the joint venture's initial capitalization,including investments in new technology.This joint venture was accounted for as an equity investment effective January1, 1995, with revenues and expenses of the affected business units recordedwithin other revenue.SALE OF CHEMICAL BANK NEW JERSEY NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONOn October 6, 1995, the Corporation sold Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. andits subsidiaries, including Chemical Bank New Jersey National Association, toPNC Bank Corp. for approximately $492 million.
