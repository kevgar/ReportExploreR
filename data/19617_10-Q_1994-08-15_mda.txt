 16 Part I Item 2 (continued) -------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERVIEW -------------------------------------------------------------------- Chemical Banking Corporation (the "Corporation") reported net income of $357 million, or $1.28 per common share, for the 1994 second quarter, an increase of 9% from earnings on a comparable basis (excluding tax benefits) of $327 million, or $1.14 per share, for the second quarter of 1993. Reported net income in the 1993 second quarter was $381 million, or $1.35 per share, a period in which the Corporation recognized income tax benefits of $54 million. The Corporation recognized its remaining available Federal tax benefits in the third quarter of 1993 and, as a result, the Corporation's earnings commencing with the fourth quarter of 1993 are reported on a fully-taxed basis. For the first six months of 1994, the Corporation's net income was $676 million, an increase of 12 percent from $603 million on a comparable basis for the first half of 1993. Reported net income for the first six months of 1993 was $755 million, a period in which the Corporation benefited from $152 million in accounting changes and tax benefits. The 1993 year-to-date results included the impact of two significant accounting changes. On January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), which resulted in a charge of $415 million and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109"), which resulted in an income tax benefit of $450 million. The net favorable impact of the adoption of these new accounting standards was $35 million. The Corporation's core businesses performed well in a challenging environment during the 1994 second quarter. Earnings benefited from further improvement in the Corporation's risk profile, including a substantial reduction in nonperforming assets, a sharp decline in the provision for losses and a decrease in other credit costs. The Corporation remains committed to improving its operating margins and return levels. To achieve this end, revenue initiatives and productivity programs are currently under way throughout the Corporation and are expected to contribute to ongoing improvements. Completion of a Brazilian refinancing package during the second quarter of 1994 brought to a close the broad LDC-rescheduling programs begun in the mid-1980s. Accordingly, the Corporation has combined its remaining LDC allowance for losses with its general allowance for losses and will no longer report a separate LDC allowance. The Corporation's nonperforming assets at June 30, 1994 were $2.49 billion, a decrease of $710 million, or 22%, from $3.20 billion at March 31, 1994 and a decrease of $1.04 billion, or 29%, from $3.53 billion at December 31, 1993. Moreover, after peaking in the 1992 third quarter, nonperforming assets have declined by $4.09 billion, or 62%, since September 30, 1992. As a result of the continued decline in nonperforming assets, the ratio of the allowance for losses to nonperforming loans reached 152% at June 30, 1994, compared with 117% at the 1993 year-end and 79% at June 30, 1993. At June 30, 1994, the Corporation's ratios of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and Total Capital to risk-weighted assets were 8.7% and 12.8%, respectively, well in excess of the minimum ratios specified by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board"). On July 1, 1994, the Corporation completed its tender offer for the outstanding common stock and the depositary shares representing the preferred stock of Margaretten Financial Corporation ("Margaretten"). With this acquisition, the Corporation will, based on year-end 1993 data, rank fourth nationwide in mortgage originations and fifth in mortgage servicing. This acquisition is not reflected in the 1994 second quarter results. -16-  17 Part I Item 2 (continued) -------------------------------------------------------------------- RESULTS OF OPERATIONS -------------------------------------------------------------------- NET INTEREST INCOME ==================================================================== Second Quarter Six Months ------------------- ----------- (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Total Interest Income $ 2,219 $2,132 $4,309 $4,256 ------- ------- ------- -------- Total Interest Expense 1,034 957 1,981 1,932 ------- ------- ------- ------- NET INTEREST INCOME 1,185 1,175 2,328 2,324 Taxable Equivalent Adjustment (a) 4 6 9 11 ------- ------- ------- ------- NET INTEREST INCOME - TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS $ 1,189 $1,181 $2,337 $2,335 ======= ======= ======= ======= [FN] (a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets. ==================================================================== Net interest income for the second quarter of 1994 was $1,185 million, compared with $1,175 million for the comparable 1993 period. For the first six months of 1994, net interest income was $2,328 million, versus $2,324 million for the same period of 1993. The slight increases from last year were due to an increase in interest-earning assets (including growth in consumer loans), and the favorable impact of the decrease in nonperforming loans, largely offset by a lower net yield on interest-earning assets. AVERAGE BALANCES, INTEREST RATE SPREAD AND NET YIELD ON AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS --------------------------------------------------------------------- Second Quarter ----------------------------------- 1994 1993 ---------------- ------------- AVERAGE Average (Taxable equivalent rates; BALANCE RATE Balance Rate in millions) ------- ---- ------- ---- Loans (a) $ 74,144 7.44% $ 79,900 7.19% Securities 26,594 6.54 24,029 7.39 Liquid Interest-Earning Assets 28,380 5.82 21,675 4.74 -------- -------- Total Interest-Earning Assets $129,118 6.89% $125,604 6.81% ======== ======== Interest-Bearing Liabilities $111,063 3.73% $108,242 3.53% Interest-Rate Spread 3.16 3.28 Interest-Free Funds 18,055 --- 17,362 --- -------- -------- Total Source of Funds $129,118 3.20% $125,604 3.05% ======== ======== Net Yield on Interest-Earning Assets 3.69% 3.76% ===== ===== [FN] (a) Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances. -17-  18 Part I Item 2 (continued) Six Months -------------------------------- 1994 1993 -------------- -------------- AVERAGE Average (Taxable equivalent rates; BALANCE RATE Balance Rate in millions) ------- ---- ------- ---- Loans (a) $ 74,312 7.29% $ 80,654 7.26% Securities 26,500 6.47 23,670 7.43 Liquid Interest-Earning Assets 28,647 5.48 19,789 4.96 -------- -------- Total Interest-Earning Assets $129,459 6.72% $124,113 6.92% ======== ======== Interest-Bearing Liabilities $111,081 3.59% $106,944 3.64% Interest-Rate Spread 3.13 3.28 Interest-Free Funds 18,378 --- 17,169 --- -------- -------- Total Source of Funds $129,459 3.08% $124,113 3.13% ======== ======== Net Yield on Interest-Earning Assets 3.64% 3.79% ===== ===== [FN] (a) Nonperforming loans are included in the average loan balances. The Corporation's average interest-earning assets for the 1994 second quarter were $129.1 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from the comparable period last year. For the first six months, average interest-earning assets were $129.5 billion in 1994, an increase of $5.3 billion, or 4.3%, from 1993. The composition of average interest-earning assets shifted in response to growth in liquid assets to support trading businesses and securities, more than offsetting declines in loans. While net interest income was only slightly higher than the 1993 level, the shift to lower-spread liquid assets has exerted downward pressure on the net yield on interest-earning assets. The Corporation's average total loans in the 1994 second quarter and first six months declined by $5.8 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, from the comparable 1993 periods. As a percentage of total interest-earning assets, the loan portfolio for the second quarter of 1994 decreased to 57% from 65% in the same period a year ago. The decline in the loan portfolio reflects a continued reduction in commercial loans (albeit at a much lower rate than prior quarters), largely offset by an increase in the consumer portfolio. For a further discussion of the Corporation's loans, see the Credit Portfolio section in this Form 10-Q. The Corporation's liquid interest-earning assets and securities averaged $55.0 billion in the 1994 second quarter, compared with $45.7 billion for the same period in 1993. For the first six months, liquid interest-earning assets and securities averaged $55.1 billion in 1994, compared with $43.4 billion for 1993. As a percentage of total interest-earning assets, combined liquid assets and securities for the second quarter were 43% in 1994 versus 35% in the 1993 comparable period, reflecting the growth in liquid assets to support the Corporation's trading businesses and securities. The $3.5 billion growth in interest-earning assets for the 1994 second quarter was funded by higher interest-bearing liabilities of $2.8 billion and a $.7 billion increase in interest-free funds. For the first half of 1994, the higher level of interest-earning assets was funded by a $4.1 billion increase in interest-bearing liabilities and a $1.2 billion increase in interest-free funds. The negative impact on net interest income from nonperforming loans in the second quarter of 1994 was $38 million, down from $49 million in the same quarter in 1993. For the first six months, the negative impact was $57 million in 1994, compared with a negative impact of $98 million in 1993. The improvement in both 1994 periods is principally due to the significant reduction in the level of the Corporation's nonperforming loans. -18-  19 Part I Item 2 (continued) The net yield on interest-earning assets, which is the average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds, including the impact of interest-free funds, was 3.69% in the second quarter of 1994, compared with 3.76% in same period in 1993. The net yield on interest-earning assets for the first six months of 1994 was 3.64%, compared with 3.79% for the same period in 1993. The decline in the net yield was affected by the aforementioned shift in the Corporation's balance sheet asset mix, partially offset by the smaller negative impact from nonperforming loans. The contribution from interest-free funds to the net yield was 53 basis points in the 1994 second quarter, up from 48 basis points in the 1993 second quarter. The increase resulted from the higher average interest-earning asset rate in 1994, as well as the increased level of interest-free funds that financed interest- earning assets. Management anticipates that the net yield on interest-earning assets for the remainder of 1994 will approximate the net yield for the first six months of 1994 but that the net yield on interest-earning assets for the full year 1994 will be lower than the net yield on interest-earning assets for the full year 1993. Management nevertheless expects that net interest income for the full year 1994 will approximate the 1993 level as an anticipated higher level of interest-earning assets is expected to offset the anticipated decline in the net yield. For additional information on average balances and net interest income, see Average Consolidated Balance Sheet, Interest and Rates on pages 50-51. PROVISION FOR LOSSES The Corporation's provision for losses was $160 million for the 1994 second quarter, compared with $205 million in the 1994 first quarter, and $363 million in the 1993 second quarter. For the first six months, the provision for losses was $365 million in 1994 versus $675 million in 1993. Included in the 1993 second quarter provision was $55 million related to the decision to accelerate the disposition of certain nonperforming residential mortgage loans. As a result of management's evaluation of the continuing improvement in the Corporation's credit profile, the provision for losses in the 1994 second quarter and first half was lower than the Corporation's net charge-offs in each of those periods. The Corporation expects the provision for losses for each of the subsequent quarters in 1994 to decline further from the level of the provision for the 1994 second quarter. A discussion of the Corporation's credit portfolio, net charge-offs and allowance for losses appears in the Credit Portfolio section in this Form 10-Q. NONINTEREST REVENUE Second Quarter Six Months --------------- ------------- (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Trust and Investment Management Fees $ 108 $ 102 $ 218 $ 200 Corporate Finance and Syndication Fees 93 84 175 155 Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 75 77 144 144 Fees for Other Banking Services 279 272 569 523 Trading Account and Foreign Exchange Revenues 203 298 388 550 Securities Gains 13 5 59 75 Other Revenue 96 204 245 320 ------ ------ ------ ------ Total Noninterest Revenue $ 867 $1,042 $1,798 $1,967 ====== ====== ====== ====== The decrease in noninterest revenue for the 1994 second quarter and first six months when compared to corresponding 1993 periods reflected lower trading account and foreign exchange revenues, as well as lower revenues from equity-related investments and lower gains from the sales of emerging markets debt securities. The aforementioned decreases were partially offset by increased corporate finance fees, credit card services fees, and trust and investment management fees. -19-  20 Part I Item 2 (continued) Trust and investment management fees are primarily comprised of corporate, institutional and personal trust activities. Services provided include custody, security services, and private banking to customers on a global basis. The following table presents the components of trust and investment management fees for the periods indicated. Second Quarter Six Months ------------------ ------------- (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Trust and Investment Management Fees: Personal Trust Fees $ 54 $ 46 $ 107 $ 97 Corporate and Institutional Trust Fees 45 46 91 85 Other, primarily Foreign Asset Management 9 10 20 18 ------- ------- ------- ------- Total $ 108 $ 102 $ 218 $ 200 ======= ======= ======= ======= For the second quarter and first six months of 1994, personal trust fees rose 17% and 10%, respectively, from the comparable 1993 periods. The increases were primarily due to higher volume and new customer relationships developed as a result of the acquisition of Ameritrust Texas Corporation ("Ameritrust"). Partially offsetting these increases was a slight decline in corporate and institutional trust fees in the 1994 second quarter as a result of pricing pressures affecting this business. Corporate finance and syndication fees were $93 million in the 1994 second quarter and $175 million in the first six months of 1994, increases of 11% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable periods last year. The increases from last year reflect higher global loan originations and distributions by the Corporation as well as new revenue from underwriting public corporate debt offerings. During the first half of 1994, the Corporation acted as agent or co-agent for approximately $129 billion of syndicated credit facilities, a reflection of the Corporation's large client base and strong emphasis on distribution. The following table sets forth the components of fees for other banking services for the periods indicated. Second Quarter Six Months ------------- ----------- (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Fees for Other Banking Services: Credit Card Services Revenue $ 75 $ 55 $ 150 $ 108 Fees in Lieu of Compensating Balances 49 52 107 104 Commission on Letters of Credit and Acceptances 39 40 76 80 Loan Commitment Fees 23 25 45 46 Mortgage Servicing Fees 18 17 34 32 Other Fees 75 83 157 153 ------ ------ ------ ------ Total $ 279 $ 272 $ 569 $ 523 ====== ====== ====== ====== The higher level of credit card services revenue for both 1994 periods included fees from the new Shell MasterCard, reflecting increased volume of retail credit cards from a growing cardholder base. Combined trading account and foreign exchange revenues in the 1994 second quarter were $203 million, versus a record $298 million in the same period in 1993, and as compared with $185 million in the first quarter of 1994. For the first six months, combined trading account and foreign exchange revenues were $388 million in 1994, compared with $550 million in 1993. The decline in trading results for both the second quarter and first half of 1994 from the prior year reflected difficult conditions in certain trading markets, including emerging market debt and European government bonds, and in many foreign exchange markets. -20-  21 Part I Item 2 (continued) The following table sets forth the components of trading account and foreign exchange revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 1994 and 1993. ==================================================================== Second Quarter Six Months ------------------ ------------ (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Trading Account and Foreign Exchange Revenue: Interest Rate Contracts (a) $ 135 $ 97 $ 223 $ 226 Foreign Exchange Revenue (b) 55 96 100 164 Debt Instruments and Other (c) 13 105 65 160 ------ ------ ------ ------ Total $ 203 $ 298 $ 388 $ 550 ====== ====== ====== ====== [FN] (a) Includes interest rate swaps, currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures, and forward rate agreements and related hedges. (b) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts. (c) Includes U.S. government and foreign government agency and corporate debt securities, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives, equity securities, equity derivatives, and commodity derivatives. ==================================================================== The trading environment was difficult during the first six months of 1994. While rates in the U.S. bond markets have been increasing during 1994, along with the economic cycle, the foreign exchange markets and European bond markets have not generally followed underlying economic trends. As such, positions taken in these foreign markets have not been as profitable as in prior periods. Interest rate contract revenues increased in the second quarter of 1994 compared with the same 1993 period primarily reflecting earnings on certain derivative instruments resulting from higher demand for these hedging products. Foreign exchange revenues decreased during the first six months of 1994 primarily due to unexpected movements in the U.S. dollar. The decrease in debt instrument revenue was primarily due to difficult conditions in the emerging debt markets, as well as in the European government bond markets. Trading revenues are affected by many factors including volatility of currencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by the Corporation's customers, the Corporation's success in proprietary positioning, its credit ratings, and steps taken by central banks and governments to affect financial markets. The Corporation believes that its trading business is a significant core business and that its recently improved credit standing will benefit the Corporation's trading revenues by enabling the Corporation to utilize a wider array of products with additional counterparties. However, the Corporation expects that its trading revenues will fluctuate as factors, such as market volatility, governmental actions, or success in proprietary positioning, may vary from period to period and may not be as favorable in future periods as they were during 1993. Securities gains were $13 million in the 1994 second quarter, an increase of $8 million from the same period in 1993. For the first six months, securities gains were $59 million in 1994, versus $75 million in 1993. Other revenue in the 1994 second quarter was $96 million, compared with $204 million in the 1993 second quarter. For the first six months, other revenue was $245 million in 1994, compared with $320 million in 1993. The following table presents the composition of other noninterest revenue for the second quarters and first six months of 1994 and 1993. -21-  22 Part I Item 2 (continued) ==================================================================== Second Quarter Six Months ------------- ---------- (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Other Revenue: Revenue from Equity-Related Investments $ 66 $ 115 $ 149 $ 143 Net Gains on LDC-Related Interest Bond Sales --- 44 45 100 All Other Revenue 30 45 51 77 ------ ------ ------ ------ Total $ 96 $ 204 $ 245 $ 320 ====== ====== ====== ====== ==================================================================== Revenue from equity-related investments, which includes income from venture capital activities and emerging markets investments, was $66 million in the 1994 second quarter, compared with $115 million in the same 1993 period. For the first half of 1994, revenue from equity-related investments was $149 million, a slight increase from the comparable 1993 period. At June 30, 1994, the Corporation had equity-related investments with a carrying value of $1.9 billion. The Corporation believes that equity-related investments will continue to make substantial contributions to the Corporation's earnings, although the timing of the recognition of gains from such activities is unpredictable and it is expected that revenues from such activities will vary significantly from period to period. For further discussion of the Corporation's venture capital activities, see page B30 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. In the 1994 second quarter, the Corporation had no LDC-related past- due interest bond sales versus gains from the sales of such bonds of $44 million in the 1993 second quarter. The 1994 first half results included the recognition of $45 million in net gains from LDC- related past-due interest bonds, compared with $100 million in the same period a year ago. All other revenue includes the Corporation's share of CIT's net income which, after purchase accounting adjustments, was $19 million in the 1994 second quarter and $36 million in the first six months, increases from $17 million and $32 million, respectively, for the comparable 1993 periods. Also included in all other revenue for the second quarter of 1994 was a net loss of $6 million incurred in connection with the Corporation's residential mortgage sales activities, compared with a net loss of $25 million in the 1994 first quarter and a net gain of $5 million in the 1993 second quarter. The results for the second quarter and first quarter of 1994 included $19 million and $11 million, respectively, of revenue from the sale of mortgage servicing rights. For the first six months of 1994, the Corporation's residential mortgage sales activities incurred a $31 million loss (net of $30 million of gains from the sale of servicing rights), compared with a $12 million gain the first six months of 1993 (no servicing rights were sold in the first half of 1993). NONINTEREST EXPENSE ==================================================================== Second Quarter Six Months -------------- ---------- (in millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 ------ ------ ------ ------ Salaries $ 542 $ 529 $1,060 $ 1,030 Employee Benefits 102 105 221 207 Occupancy Expense 140 145 286 290 Equipment Expense 91 88 175 163 Foreclosed Property Expense 2 85 37 156 Restructuring Charge --- --- 48 43 Other Expense 404 360 778 699 ------ ------ ------ ------ Total Noninterest Expense $1,281 $ 1,312 $2,605 $ 2,588 ====== ====== ====== ====== ==================================================================== -22-  23 Part I Item 2 (continued) Noninterest expense in the 1994 second quarter was $1,281 million, compared with $1,312 million in the second quarter of 1993. Expenses for the second quarter of 1994 reflected additional costs of $47 million associated with the acquisition of Ameritrust and operating costs connected with the Shell MasterCard (including marketing expenses that increased $21 million largely reflecting the advertising campaign for the co-branded program). For the first six months, noninterest expense was $2,605 million in 1994 versus $2,588 million in 1993. Included in the results for the first six months of 1994 was a $48 million restructuring charge, recorded in the first quarter, related to the closing of 50 New York state branches. The results for the first six months of 1993 included a restructuring charge of $43 million associated with the Federally-assisted acquisition in February 1993 of certain assets and liabilities of four former banks (the "First City Banks") of First City Bancorporation of Texas, Inc. by Texas Commerce Bancshares. Excluding the restructuring charges in both years, noninterest expense for the first half of 1994 increased by $12 million or less than 1% from the comparable 1993 period. Noninterest expense for the first six months of 1994, when compared with the comparable 1993 period, reflected higher expenses associated with investments in certain key businesses partially offset by lower foreclosed property expense. The investments included the 1993 acquisitions by Texas Commerce (which contributed approximately $37 million in additional operating expenses) and higher operating costs of $66 million related to the co-branded Shell MasterCard program in the first six months of 1994. The ratio of noninterest operating expense (excluding nonrecurring charges) to total operating revenue was 62.4% in the 1994 second quarter, compared with 59.2% in the same 1993 period. This ratio for the first six months of 1994 was 62.0% compared with 58.8% for the first six months of 1993. The Corporation anticipates its revenue growth in certain key businesses and its various productivity initiatives will improve the ratio of noninterest operating expenses to total operating revenue. The increases in salaries for the 1994 second quarter and first six months were primarily due to additional staff costs resulting from the 1993 acquisitions by Texas Commerce, the implementation of the Shell MasterCard program, and the increase in the Corporation's securities underwriting business, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs due to the lower trading results. Total staff at June 30, 1994 amounted to 40,988 compared with 41,303 at June 30, 1993, as staff increases in areas with revenue growth initiatives were more than offset by reductions from continued integration and productivity efforts. In the first six months of 1994, employee benefits increased $14 million from the prior year period reflecting the 1993 Texas Commerce acquisitions, as well as a change in actuarial assumptions used for pension expense and Other Postretirement Benefits ("OPEB") expense. Total 1994 pension expense is expected to be higher than the 1993 level, as a result of a decrease in the discount rate utilized in determining the benefit obligation to 7.5%. Higher costs related to various medical plans also contributed to the increase in employee benefits. Equipment expense in the 1994 second quarter was $91 million compared with $88 million in the same 1993 period. For the first six months, equipment expense was $175 million in 1994, versus $163 million in 1993. The increase in 1994 was primarily the result of continued technology enhancements to support the Corporation's investment in certain key businesses. Foreclosed property expense was $2 million in 1994 second quarter, compared with $85 million in the 1993 second quarter. The current quarter expense benefited by approximately $15 million of gains from the sale of foreclosed property. Additionally, included in the 1993 second quarter amount was $20 million related to the decision to accelerate the disposition of certain foreclosed residential properties arising from loans originally extended several years ago under a reduced documentation mortgage program that was discontinued in 1990. For the first six months, foreclosed property expense was $37 million in 1994 versus $156 million in 1993, reflecting significant progress in managing the Corporation's real estate portfolio. Management expects that foreclosed property expense in each of the 1994 third and fourth quarters will be higher than the amount of foreclosed property expense in the 1994 second quarter; nevertheless, management continues to expect that foreclosed property expense for the full year 1994 will be significantly lower than the full year 1993 level. -23-  24 Part I Item 2 (continued) Other expense is comprised of items such as professional services, insurance, marketing, communications expense and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") assessments. Other expense for the 1994 second quarter was $404 million, compared with $360 million in the same period in 1993. Other expense for the 1994 second quarter reflected additional costs of $30 million in connection with the Shell MasterCard (including $21 million of marketing expenses). Also contributing to the quarter-over-quarter increase in other expense was higher professional fees, up 8% to $59 million, reflecting increased use of contract computer consultants associated with the Corporation's ongoing technology enhancement efforts. For the first six months, other expense was $778 million in 1994, compared with $699 million for the prior year. The increase principally reflects higher marketing expenses, professional services and telecommunication costs, as well as expenses associated with the First City Banks and Ameritrust acquisitions. Included in other expense for the first six months of 1994 was approximately $20 million related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and other ongoing expenses associated with the First City Banks and Ameritrust acquisitions. As a result of these acquisitions, total amortization of goodwill and intangibles amounted to $56 million in the first half of 1994, an increase of 10% from the same period in 1993. Marketing expenses for the first six months of 1994 was $97 million, an increase of $29 million from comparable period in 1993, reflecting the marketing campaign for the co-branded Shell MasterCard project, as well as increased promotional advertising related to the Corporation's retail banking business. The Corporation expects that total noninterest operating expense in 1994 will be somewhat higher than that in 1993, reflecting costs associated with the continued investment by the Corporation to grow key business activities. INCOME TAXES The Corporation's effective tax rate was 41.5% in the second quarter and the first six months of 1994, compared with 29.7% and 30.0% in the respective 1993 periods. Tax expense included income tax benefits of $54 million in the 1993 second quarter and $117 million in the first six months of 1993. Because the Corporation recognized its remaining available Federal tax benefits in the third quarter of 1993, the Corporation's earnings beginning in the fourth quarter of 1993 were reported on a fully-taxed basis. -------------------------------------------------------------------- LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS -------------------------------------------------------------------- Profitability of the Corporation is tracked with an internal management information system that produces lines-of-business performance within the Global Bank, Regional Bank, Real Estate and Corporate sectors. A set of management accounting policies has been developed and implemented to ensure that the reported results of the groups reflect the economics of their businesses. Lines-of-business results are subject to restatement as appropriate whenever there are refinements in management reporting policies or changes to the management organization. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been restated to conform with the current 1994 presentation. Lines-of-business results are subject to further restatements as may be necessary to reflect future changes in internal management reporting. -24-  25 Part I Item 2 (continued) -25-  26 Part I Item 2 (continued) Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred by businesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating shareholders' equity and the provision for losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology. Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to the business units except for special corporate one-time charges. Management has developed a risk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different types of risk -- credit, operating and market -- within various businesses and assigns capital accordingly. Credit risk is computed using a risk grading system that is consistently applied throughout the Corporation. During the second quarter of 1994, the Corporation revised its equity allocation approach to fully -26-  27 Part I Item 2 (continued) allocate all equity from its Corporate sector back to the business units. These changes resulted in the restatement of the business units' capital for the 1994 first quarter and for all of 1993. A long-term expected income tax rate is assigned in evaluating the Corporation's businesses. Texas Commerce's results are tracked and reported on a legal entity basis, including the return on equity calculation. GLOBAL BANK The Global Bank is organized into four principal management entities: Banking & Corporate Finance (worldwide wholesale client management and venture capital activities); Structured Finance (loan syndications, high yield securities and mergers & acquisitions); Asia, Europe & Capital Markets (securities, foreign exchange and derivatives trading, the Corporation's treasury functions and administration of the international branch system in Asia and Europe); and Developing Markets (cross-border investment banking, local merchant banking and trade finance). The Global Bank seeks to optimize its risk profile by emphasizing underwriting, distribution, and risk management skills. The Global Bank's net income in the second quarter of 1994 was $209 million, a decrease of $118 million from the second quarter of 1993. The sector's return on equity in the second quarter of 1994 was 19.4% compared with 26.8% in the 1993 second quarter. The decline in the 1994 second quarter results was primarily due to decreases in noninterest revenue of $187 million and in net interest income of $66 million, partially offset by a decrease in credit provision of $37 million. The Global Bank's net income of $449 million and return on equity of 20.8% for the first six months of 1994 decreased from last year's six month results of $606 million and 24.6%, respectively. The decline in the 1994 six month results was attributable to decreases in noninterest revenue of $215 million and in net interest income of $136 million, partially offset by a decrease in the credit provision of $83 million. The decrease in noninterest revenue was primarily due to the decline in trading revenues to $195 million for the second quarter of 1994, compared with a record of $290 million in the 1993 second quarter. For the first six months, trading revenues were $375 million in 1994, a decrease from $534 million in 1993. The unfavorable trading results reflect increasing interest rates as a result of actions take by the Federal Reserve Board in the first six months of 1994, and the volatile conditions in certain trading markets, including emerging market debt and European government bonds, and in many foreign exchange markets. Revenues from equity-related investments for the second quarter of 1994 were lower than the comparable period in 1993 as a result of lower gains from venture capital activities. In the 1994 second quarter, the Corporation had no LDC-related past- due interest bond sales versus gains from the sales of such bonds of $44 million in the 1993 second quarter. The 1994 first half results included the recognition of $45 million in net gains from LDC- related past-due interest bonds, compared with $100 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in net interest income was due to the rising interest rate environment, combined with a change in the mix of earning assets from loans to lower interest-earning liquid assets. For the first six months of 1994, noninterest expense rose $4 million, compared with the same period in 1993, due primarily to the Corporation's continued investment in its securities business. The substantial increase in average assets is due primarily to the adoption of FASI 39. REGIONAL BANK The Regional Bank includes Retail Banking (New York Markets -- consumer banking and commercial and professional banking; Retail Card Services; and National Consumer Business), Regional Relationship Banking (Middle Market -- regional commercial banking; Private Banking; and Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc.) and Geoserve (cash management, funds transfer, trade, corporate trust and securities services worldwide). The Corporation's Technology and Operations group is also managed within this organizational structure. The Corporation maintains a leading market share position in serving the financial needs of Middle Market commercial enterprises in the New York metropolitan area. -27-  28 Part I Item 2 (continued) The Regional Bank's net income of $147 million and return on equity of 21.3% for the second quarter of 1994 increased from last year's second quarter results of $119 million and 15.5%, respectively. The increase in earnings is attributable to improvements in net interest income of $38 million and noninterest revenue of $20 million coupled with a lower credit provision of $8 million, partially offset by higher noninterest expense of $16 million. For the first six months of 1994, the Regional Bank's net income of $253 million and return on equity of 18.2% improved from $245 million and 16.1%, respectively, for the first six months of 1993. The results for the first six months of 1994 included a restructuring charge of $48 million ($28 million after-tax) related to the closing of 50 New York branches and a staff reduction of 650. Excluding this restructuring charge, the Regional Bank's net income would have been $281 million and its return on equity would have been 20.4% for the first six months of 1994. The increase in earnings (excluding the restructuring charge) can be attributable to increases in net interest income of $38 million and noninterest revenue of $29 million coupled with a lower credit provision of $27 million, offset partially by increased noninterest expense of $22 million. The improvement in net interest income was primarily due to a higher level of interest-earning assets, coupled with higher demand deposits and improved spreads in New York Markets. The increase of $20 million in noninterest revenue reflected the higher fees from revolving credit products in Retail Card Services primarily due to the launch of the co-branded Shell MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 1993. In addition, New York Markets recorded higher deposit servicing fees. Partially offsetting these positive factors was the impact of losses on residential mortgage warehouse activities in the National Consumer Business and lower corporate finance fees in Middle Market. The lower credit provision resulted from improvements in credit quality for Middle Market, Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. and the Retail Card Services portfolio. The increase in noninterest expense is primarily due to the aforementioned launch of the Shell MasterCard, which resulted in higher operating expenses of $34 million in the second quarter of 1994 and of $66 million in the first six months. This increase was partially offset by expense management initiatives throughout the Regional Bank coupled with lower foreclosed property expense, primarily in Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES Texas Commerce is a leader in providing financial products and services to businesses and individuals throughout Texas. Texas Commerce is the primary bank for more large corporations and middle market companies than any other bank in Texas. As of June 30, 1994, Texas Commerce had $21 billion in total assets with 115 locations statewide. Texas Commerce's net income in the second quarter of 1994 was $60 million, an increase of 35% from last year's second quarter results of $44 million. The increase in the 1994 second quarter period compared with the 1993 second quarter period was primarily due to decreases in the credit provision of $15 million and noninterest expense of $14 million and higher noninterest revenue of $5 million, partially offset by a $7 million decline in net interest income. For the first six months, Texas Commerce's net income increased to $111 million in 1994, compared with $89 million in 1993. This improvement resulted from the lower credit provision of $31 million, higher noninterest revenue of $18 million and lower noninterest expense of $14 million, partially offset by a $15 million decline in net interest income. The $89 million net income for the first half of 1993 excludes the restructuring charge ($43 million pre-tax; $30 million after-tax) related to the acquisition of the First City Banks and a positive $14 million after-tax net effect from the implementation of SFAS 106 and SFAS 109. Based on continuing improvements in asset quality and Texas Commerce's already adequate allowance for losses, Texas Commerce recorded a negative credit provision (i.e. credit to the provision for losses) in the first half of 1994. The increase in noninterest revenue is due to strong revenue growth from fee-based services which was up 4% from the second quarter of 1993 and up 8% from the first half of 1993. Trust income rose 34% from the second quarter of 1993 (up 40% from the first half of 1993), reflecting both increased demand for Texas Commerce's services as well as the effects of the acquisitions of First City Banks and Ameritrust last year. The decrease in net interest income is attributable to lower loan volumes and less favorable interest rate spreads. -28-  29 Part I Item 2 (continued) The decline in noninterest expense is attributable to lower foreclosed property expense (down $45 million compared to the first half of 1993), due to improved credit quality. This favorable result offset the additional operating expenses associated with the 1993 acquisitions. Nonperforming assets declined to $177 million at June 30, 1994, down $14 million from the 1994 first quarter. The decrease represented the 24th consecutive quarterly decline from a peak of $1,303 million in mid-1988. REAL ESTATE Real Estate includes the management of the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio, exclusive of those in Chemical New Jersey Holdings, Inc. (included in Regional Bank section) and in Texas Commerce. Real Estate had a net loss of $37 million for the second quarter of 1994 compared with a net loss of $56 million in the second quarter of 1993. For the first six months, Real Estate's net loss was $80 million in 1994, compared with $102 million in 1993. The improvement in net income was primarily due to a decrease in credit provision and lower foreclosed property expense reflecting the significant progress made in managing the Corporation's real estate portfolio. Total nonperforming assets at June 30, 1994 were $1,074 million, a decline of 10% from $1,190 million in the first quarter of 1994 and a decline of 18% from the 1993 year-end. CORPORATE Corporate had a net loss of $22 million for the 1994 second quarter and a net loss of $57 million for the first six months of 1994, compared with a net loss of $53 million and $83 million, respectively, for the same period in 1993. Corporate includes the management results attributed to the parent company; the Corporation's investment in CIT; and some effects remaining at the corporate level after the implementation of management accounting policies, including residual credit provision and tax expense. Included in the $83 million net loss for the first six months of 1993 were the following one-time items: the recognition of $117 million in Federal tax benefits, an after-tax loss of $53 million ($75 million pre-tax) due to the writedown associated with the planned disposition of residential mortgages, a net $35 million gain from the adoption of SFAS 106 and SFAS 109 and a $30 million after- tax restructuring charge ($43 million pre-tax) related to the acquisition of the First City Banks. -------------------------------------------------------------------- BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS -------------------------------------------------------------------- The Corporation's total assets were $168.9 billion at June 30, 1994, an increase of $19.0 billion from the 1993 year-end. The higher level of total assets was principally due to the adoption of FASI 39 on January 1, 1994. As a result of the adoption of this accounting standard, total assets and liabilities each increased by approximately $19.0 billion at June 30, 1994, with unrealized gains reported as Trading Assets-Risk Management Instruments and unrealized losses reported in Other Liabilities. Prior to the adoption of FASI 39, unrealized gains and losses were reported net in Other Assets. -29-  30 Part I Item 2 (continued) SECURITIES As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"). As a result of the adoption of SFAS 115, debt and equity securities that were previously measured either at amortized cost or at the lower of aggregate amortized cost or market are currently measured at fair value. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of SFAS 115. The prepayment trends of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") is actively monitored through the Corporation's portfolio management function. The Corporation typically invests in CMOs that the Corporation believes have stable cash flows and relatively short duration, thereby limiting the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the portfolio. Management regularly does simulation testing of the impact that interest and market rate changes would have on its CMO portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs which management believes have high prepayment risk are included in the available-for-sale portfolio. CREDIT PORTFOLIO The following loan review discussion focuses primarily on developments since December 31, 1993 and should be read in conjunction with the Credit Portfolio section on pages B34 - B42 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. The Corporation's loans outstanding totaled $74.7 billion at June 30, 1994, a decline of $696 million from year-end 1993 and $4.5 billion lower than June 30, 1993. The decline in the loan portfolio reflects a continued reduction in commercial loans (albeit at a much lower rate than prior quarters), largely offset by an increase in the consumer portfolio. The commercial loan outstandings have declined due to management's strategic decision to reduce the credit risk profile of the Corporation as well as ongoing loan paydowns from businesses that are refinancing their borrowings in the debt and equity markets. The loan portfolio at June 30, 1994 was relatively unchanged from the March 31, 1994 level, in contrast to a decline experienced in the Corporation's total loan portfolio for each of the eight consecutive quarters ended March 31, 1994. Management believes that there was a modest increase in loan demand during the second quarter of 1994 and, as a result, expects a modest increase in loan outstandings for the remaining quarters of 1994. The Corporation is a leading participant in loan originations and sales. This activity is comprised of the origination and sale of loans and lending commitments to investors, generally without recourse. These sales include syndication, assignment and participation, and include both short- and medium-term transactions. This loan distribution capability allows the Corporation to compete aggressively and profitably in wholesale lending markets by enabling it to originate and subsequently reduce larger individual credit exposures and thereby to price more flexibly than if all loans were held as permanent investments. The Corporation also benefits from increased liquidity. During the 1994 second quarter and six months, the Corporation acted as agent or co-agent for approximately $78 billion and $129 billion, respectively, in syndicated credit facilities. -30-  31 Part I Item 2 (continued) The Corporation's loan balances were as follows for the dates indicated: ==================================================================== JUNE 30, December 31, June 30, (in millions) 1994 1993 1993 -------- ------------ -------- LOANS Domestic Commercial: Commercial Real Estate (a) $ 6,706 $ 7,338 $ 8,225 Commercial and Industrial 19,601 18,874 23,484 Financial Institutions 3,384 4,816 3,367 ------- ------- ------- Total Commercial Loans 29,691 31,028 35,076 ------- ------- ------- Domestic Consumer: (b) Residential Mortgage 12,361 12,244 11,674 Credit Card 7,774 7,176 6,279 Other Consumer 6,538 6,266 6,021 ------- ------- ------- Total Consumer Loans 26,673 25,686 23,974 ------- ------- ------- Total Domestic Loans 56,364 56,714 59,050 Foreign, primarily commercial (c) 18,321 18,667 20,150 ------- ------- ------- Total Loans $ 74,685 $ 75,381 $79,200 ======= ======= ======= [FN] (a) Represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans secured by mortgages on 1-4 family residential properties.

(c) Includes loans previously classified as LDC loans. Previously reported loan amounts have been reclassified to conform with the June 30, 1994 presentation. ==================================================================== NONPERFORMING ASSETS For a description of the Corporation's accounting policies for its nonperforming loans, renegotiated loans and assets acquired as loan satisfactions, see Note One of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages B57-B58 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. For a description of the Corporation's shared loss assets acquired from First City which are subject to loss sharing provisions of the Purchase and Assumption Agreements between the FDIC and Texas Commerce, see Note Seven of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page B64 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. At June 30, 1994, nonperforming shared loss assets were $87 million. Such assets are not included in the amount of nonperforming assets below. -31-  32 Part I Item 2 (continued) The following table sets forth the nonperforming assets and contractually past-due loans of the Corporation at June 30, 1994, December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1993. ==================================================================== JUNE 30, December 31, June 30, (in millions) 1994 1993 1993 -------- ------------ -------- NONPERFORMING LOANS: Domestic Commercial: Commercial Real Estate $ 645 $ 682 $ 977 Commercial and Industrial 570 867 1,440 Financial Institutions 14 24 44 -------- -------- -------- Total Commercial Loans 1,229 1,573 2,461 -------- -------- -------- Domestic Consumer: Residential Mortgage 144 101 85 Other Consumer 21 24 26 -------- -------- -------- Total Consumer Loans 165 125 111 -------- -------- -------- Total Domestic 1,394 1,698 2,572 Foreign, primarily commercial (a) 364 893 1,192 -------- -------- -------- Total Nonperforming Loans $ 1,758 $ 2,591 $ 3,764 Assets Acquired as Loan Satisfactions 735 934 1,099 -------- -------- -------- Total Nonperforming Assets $ 2,493 $ 3,525 $ 4,863 ======== ======== ======== Contractually Past-Due Loans (b): Consumer $ 267 $ 299 $ 290 Commercial and Other Loans 61 24 105 -------- -------- -------- Total Contractually Past-Due Loans $ 328 $ 323 $ 395 ======== ======== ======== [FN] (a) Includes nonperforming loans previously classified as LDC nonperforming loans. Previously reported amounts have been restated to conform with the June 30, 1994 presentation. (b) Accruing loans past-due 90 days or more as to principal and interest, which are not characterized as nonperforming loans. ==================================================================== The Corporation's total nonperforming assets at June 30, 1994 were $2,493 million, a decrease of $1,032 million from the 1993 year-end level and a decrease of $2,370 million from last year's comparable quarter. This improvement in the Corporation's credit profile is a result of a significantly lower level of loans being placed on nonperforming status as well as the result of repayments, charge- offs, and the Corporation's continuing loan workout and collection activities. Included in foreign nonperforming loans at June 30, 1994 were nonperforming LDC loans of $145 million, a decrease from $524 million at March 31, 1994, principally the result of the completion of the Brazilian refinancing program. For a further discussion of the Brazilian debt exchange, see the Brazil section in this Form 10-Q. Management expects a further significant reduction in the level of its nonperforming assets during the remainder of 1994, although at a lower rate than the reduction in nonperforming assets during the first half of 1994. -32-  33 Part I Item 2 (continued) The following table presents the reconciliation of nonperforming assets for the second quarter and first six months of 1994 and 1993. ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES The accompanying table reflects the activity in the allowance for losses for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 1994 and 1993. -33-  34 Part I Item 2 (continued) Completion of the Brazilian refinancing package during the 1994 second quarter brought to a close the broad rescheduling programs begun in the mid-1980s. In connection with completion of the Brazilian refinancing program, the Corporation performed a final valuation of its LDC portfolio, adjusting its medium- and long-term outstandings to the various LDC countries constituting the portfolio to amounts that management believes to be the estimated net recoverable values of each of such loans at June 30, 1994. The final valuation resulted in a $291 million charge in the 1994 second quarter. The remaining LDC allowance of $300 million (after taking the aforementioned charge-off) was transferred to the general allowance for losses. The following table presents the Corporation's allowance coverage ratios at June 30, 1994, December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1993. ALLOWANCE COVERAGE RATIOS ==================================================================== JUNE 30, December 31, June 30, For the Period Ended: 1994 1993 1993 -------- ------------ -------- Allowance for Losses to: Loans at Period-End 3.58% 4.01% 3.78% Average Loans 3.60 3.84 3.71 Nonperforming Loans 152.22 116.56 79.46 ==================================================================== The Corporation deems its allowance for losses at June 30, 1994 to be adequate. Although the Corporation considers that it has sufficient reserves to absorb losses that may currently exist in the portfolio, but are not yet identifiable, the precise loss content from the loan portfolio, as well as from other balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit-related instruments, is subject to continuing review based on quality indicators, concentrations, changes in business conditions, and other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements.

Management expects total net charge-offs in 1994 to decrease significantly from the full year 1993 amount. DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE The domestic commercial real estate portfolio represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties, which are included in the consumer loan portfolio. The domestic commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $6.7 billion at June 30, 1994, a decline from $7.3 billion at December 31, 1993 and a decline from $8.2 billion at June 30, 1993. The decreases from the 1993 year-end and year ago periods are attributable to repayments, transfers to real estate owned and charge-offs. The table below sets forth the major components of the domestic commercial real estate loan portfolio at the dates indicated. ==================================================================== JUNE 30, December 31, June 30, (in millions) 1994 1993 1993 -------- ------------ -------- Commercial Mortgages $5,584 $ 5,917 $ 6,506 Construction 1,122 1,421 1,719 ------ ------ ------ Total Domestic Commercial Real Estate Loans $6,706 $ 7,338 $ 8,225 ====== ====== ====== ==================================================================== Commercial mortgages provide financing for the acquisition or refinancing of commercial properties, and typically have terms ranging from three-to-seven years. Construction loans are generally originated to finance the construction of real estate projects. When the real estate project has cash flows sufficient to support a commercial mortgage, the loan is transferred from construction status to commercial mortgage status. -35-  36 Part I Item 2 (continued) The following table shows the Corporation's domestic commercial real estate loans, nonperforming loans and foreclosed commercial real estate, by property type and geographic location. DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BY PROPERTY TYPE AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION (a) JUNE 30, 1994 ----------------------------- Dec. 31, Other 1993 (in millions) NY/NJ Texas Domestic TOTAL Total ----- ----- -------- ----- ------- OFFICE: Loans $ 799 $ 367 $ 302 $1,468 $1,589 Nonperforming Loans 52 2 72 126 180 Real Estate Owned 41 37 22 100 140 RETAIL: Loans 609 244 357 1,210 1,370 Nonperforming Loans 31 11 2 44 52 Real Estate Owned 17 3 43 63 65 RESIDENTIAL: (b) Loans 451 168 175 794 1,161 Nonperforming Loans 94 12 16 122 130 Real Estate Owned 77 1 3 81 123 HOTEL: Loans 167 79 318 564 574 Nonperforming Loans 21 --- 77 98 72 Real Estate Owned 113 --- 15 128 211 LAND: Loans 275 146 23 444 387 Nonperforming Loans 106 5 7 118 90 Real Estate Owned 39 56 52 147 212 OTHER: Loans 1,039 644 543 2,226 2,257 Nonperforming Loans 46 19 72 137 158 Real Estate Owned 46 9 28 83 47 TOTAL: Loans $3,340 $1,648 $1,718 $6,706 $7,338 Nonperforming Loans 350 49 246 645 682 Real Estate Owned 333 106 163 602 798 [FN] (a) Nonperforming loans are included in loan balances. Real Estate Owned denotes foreclosed commercial real estate, which is included in assets acquired as loan satisfactions. (b) Represents residential property construction, land development and multi-family permanent mortgages, excluding 1-4 family residential mortgages. ==================================================================== The largest concentration of domestic commercial real estate loans is in the New York/New Jersey and Texas markets, representing 50% and 25%, respectively, of the domestic commercial real estate portfolio. No other state represented more than 3% of the domestic commercial real estate loan portfolio. -36-  37 Part I Item 2 (continued) Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate assets were $1,247 million at June 30, 1994, a 16% decrease from December 31, 1993 and a decrease of $609 million, or 33%, from June 30, 1993. The improvement in nonperforming domestic commercial real estate asset levels for the first half of 1994 is the result of increased liquidity in the commercial real estate markets as well as successful workout activities. The second quarter of 1994 was the sixth consecutive quarter in which reductions to nonperforming domestic commercial real estate assets in the form of payments, return to accrual status and sales of real estate owned were greater than the additions to nonperforming assets. Domestic commercial real estate net charge- offs in the second quarter of 1994 totaled $49 million, compared with $70 million in the same period a year ago. For the first six months, such charge-offs were $123 million in 1994, compared with $127 million in 1993. Writedowns of commercial real estate owned totaled $43 million for the first six months of 1994, compared with $99 million in first half of 1993. Approximately $79 million and $120 million in commercial real estate owned were sold during the 1994 second quarter and first six months, respectively. Generally, these assets were sold at or above carrying value. Domestic commercial real estate net charge-offs, writedowns and nonperforming assets for 1994 are expected to be below 1993 levels. DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIO The domestic commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $19.6 billion at June 30, 1994, compared with $18.9 billion at December 31, 1993 and $23.5 billion at June 30, 1993. The portfolio is diversified geographically and by industry. The largest industry concentrations are real estate related and oil and gas, both of which approximate $1.5 billion or 2.1% of total loans. All of the other remaining industries are each less than 2% of total loans. Included in the domestic commercial and industrial portfolio are loans related to highly leveraged transactions ("HLT"). The Corporation originates and syndicates loans in HLTs, which include acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations. HLT loans at June 30, 1994 totaled approximately $1.6 billion, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 1993 and $2.1 billion at June 30, 1993. The Corporation also was committed at June 30, 1994 to lend an additional amount of approximately $464 million to its HLTs. The substantial reduction in the HLT loan portfolio from June 30, 1993 can be largely attributed to repayments, reclassifications to non- HLT status and, to a lesser extent, charge-offs. At June 30, 1994, the Corporation had $182 million in nonperforming HLT loans compared with $269 million at the end of 1993 and $412 million at the end of the same period last year. Net charge-offs related to HLTs for the six months ended June 30, 1994 totaled $2 million, versus $55 million for the comparable 1993 period. DOMESTIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PORTFOLIO The domestic financial institutions portfolio includes commercial banks and companies whose businesses primarily involve lending, financing, investing, underwriting or insuring. Loans to domestic financial institutions were $3,384 million at June 30, 1994 or 5% of total loans outstanding at June 30, 1994. Loans to domestic financial institutions are predominantly to broker-dealers, which comprise over half the domestic financial institution total. DOMESTIC CONSUMER PORTFOLIO The consumer loan portfolio consists of one-to-four family residential mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans. The domestic consumer loan portfolio totaled $26.7 billion at June 30, 1994, representing 36% of total loans, an increase from $25.7 billion or 34% of total loans at December 31, 1993 and an increase from $24.0 billion or 30% of total loans at June 30, 1993. -37-  38 Part I Item 2 (continued) The following table presents the composition of the Corporation's domestic consumer loans at the dates indicated. ==================================================================== JUNE 30, December 31, June 30, (in millions) 1994 1993 1993 -------- ------------ -------- Residential Mortgages $ 12,361 $ 12,244 $ 11,674 Credit Cards 7,774 7,176 6,279 Other Consumer Loans (a) 6,538 6,266 6,021 ------- ------- ------- Total $ 26,673 $ 25,686 $ 23,974 ======= ======= ======= [FN] (a) Includes installment and student loans. ==================================================================== Credit card receivables at June 30, 1994 increased $1.5 billion from the same period a year ago, of which approximately $1.2 billion is related to the co-branded Shell MasterCard program, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 1993. Management expects continued growth in the level of Shell credit card outstandings for the remainder of 1994. Management is exploring other opportunities in the credit card area, including the feasibility of other co- branded card programs. Total nonperforming domestic consumer loans at June 30, 1994 were $165 million and were comprised of $144 million of loans secured by residential real estate and $21 million of other consumer loans. Total nonperforming domestic consumer loans at December 31, 1993 were $125 million and were comprised of $101 million of loans secured by residential real estate and $24 million of other consumer loans. At June 30, 1993, total nonperforming domestic consumer loans were $111 million and were comprised of $85 million of loans secured by residential real estate and $26 million of other consumer loans. The rise in nonperforming domestic consumer residential loans since June 30, 1993, primarily reflects increases in the nonperforming status of certain loans originally extended several years ago under a reduced documentation mortgage program. Net charge-offs in the domestic consumer loan portfolio totaled $94 million in the 1994 second quarter compared with $149 million in the 1993 second quarter. The 1994 second quarter net charge-offs consisted of $81 million in credit card receivables, $9 million in residential mortgages and $4 million in other consumer loans. The 1993 second quarter net charge-offs consisted of $60 million in residential mortgages (including $55 million related to the decision to accelerate the disposition of certain nonperforming residential mortgages), $83 million in credit card receivables and $6 million in other consumer loans. There were essentially no credit losses in the student loan portfolio due to the existence of Federal and State government agency guarantees. For the first six months of 1994, domestic consumer net charge-offs were $184 million compared with $246 million for the first six months of 1993. Domestic consumer loan balances are expected to increase in 1994, particularly in the credit card and residential mortgage portfolios. The higher residential mortgage activity is the result of the Margaretten acquisition in July 1994. In 1994, the Corporation's strategy will continue to emphasize risk management and consumer loan portfolio credit quality. Management expects consumer loan net charge-offs in the second half of 1994 will be somewhat higher than the first half due to the growth of the consumer portfolio, including the higher level of credit card receivables outstanding as a result of the Shell MasterCard program. MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES The Corporation both originates and services residential mortgage loans as part of its mortgage banking activities. After origination, the Corporation may sell loans to investors, primarily in the secondary market, while retaining the rights to service such loans. In accordance with current accounting standards, the value of such servicing rights related to originating mortgage loans is not recorded as an asset in the financial statements. The Corporation originated $2.9 billion of mortgages in the second quarter of 1994 versus $3.7 billion in the same 1993 period. For the six months ended June 30, 1994 the Corporation originated $7.0 billion of mortgages -38-  39 Part I Item 2 (continued) compared with $6.6 billion in 1993. For the first six months of 1994, the Corporation sold to investors approximately 75% of the residential mortgage loans it had originated. The 1994 second quarter results do not include the acquisition of Margaretten. In addition to originating mortgage servicing rights, the Corporation also purchases mortgage servicing rights. The Corporation may purchase bulk rights to service a loan portfolio or the Corporation may purchase loans directly and then sell such loans while retaining the servicing rights. The Corporation's servicing portfolio amounted to $40.3 billion at June 30, 1994 compared with $36.4 billion at December 31, 1993 and $35.0 billion at June 30, 1993. Purchased mortgage servicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $293 million at June 30, 1994 compared with $249 million at December 31, 1993 and $224 million at June 30, 1993. The mortgage loans to which the Corporation's servicing rights relate are, to a substantial degree, of recent vintage (i.e., originated within the past two years when interest rates have been relatively low). The Corporation utilizes an amortization method based on adjusted cash flows to amortize purchased mortgage servicing rights. The Corporation continually evaluates prepayment exposure of the portfolio, adjusting the balance and remaining life of the servicing rights as a result of prepayments. FOREIGN PORTFOLIO The foreign portfolio includes foreign commercial and industrial loans, loans to foreign financial institutions, foreign commercial real estate, loans to foreign governments and official institutions and foreign consumer loans. At June 30, 1994, the Corporation's total foreign loans were $18.3 billion, compared with $18.7 billion at December 31, 1993 and $20.2 billion at June 30, 1993. Included in foreign loans were foreign commercial and industrial loans of $7.1 billion at the end of the 1994 second quarter, an increase of $.6 billion from the 1993 year-end and $41 million from June 30, 1993. Total foreign commercial real estate loans at June 30, 1994 were $.5 billion, slightly reduced from $.6 billion at each of December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1993. A significant portion of the foreign real estate portfolio is located in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. The Corporation's medium- and long-term outstandings to countries engaged in debt rescheduling ("LDC") at June 30, 1994 were $1,546 million, a reduction of $702 million, or 31%, from December 31, 1993. The reduction from the 1993 year-end is primarily attributable to the aforementioned $291 million charge-off related to the final evaluation of the Corporation's LDC portfolio, as well as from loan sales. Total LDC outstandings were $3,503 million at June 30, 1994, a decline of $587 million from December 31, 1993. The reduction was principally due to the aforementioned reductions in medium- and long-term outstandings. BRAZIL For a discussion of significant developments with respect to the restructuring of Brazilian debt, see pages B41 and B42 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. The following significant events have occurred to date in 1994: The exchange of bank creditors' eligible medium- and long- term debt for bonds issued by the Federal Republic of Brazil occurred on April 15, 1994. The Corporation's total Brazilian outstandings affected by the exchange had a book value of $297 million. The Corporation's "Old" debt (multi-year Deposit Facility Agreement and other pre-1988 restructured debt) with a face value of $635 million (which includes loan amounts previously charged-off) was exchanged for $299 million of Capitalization bonds and $218 million of Discount bonds. The Corporation's "New" debt (credit extensions originating from the 1988 restructuring) with a face value of $165 million (which includes loan amounts previously charged off) was exchanged for $90 million of Debt Conversion bonds and $75 million of New Money bonds. The Corporation also received Eligible Interest bonds (EIs) of approximately $160 million for the majority of its remaining unpaid interest. In addition, a portion of Principal bonds ($50 million) and EIs (approximately $8 million) is currently being held in escrow to be released on September 22, 1994. The exchange did not result in any additional charge-offs by the Corporation. The aforementioned bonds received by the Corporation through the exchange are measured subject to the provisions of SFAS 115. The Corporation is classifying all the bonds it received in the exchange as available-for-sale, and therefore such bonds will be valued at fair value. As a result of the consummation of the exchange, -39-  40 Part I Item 2 (continued) the Corporation removed approximately $270 million of Brazilian loans from nonperforming status. Depending upon market conditions during the latter half of 1994, the Corporation expects to sell a portion of the EI bonds it received in the exchange. -------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL -------------------------------------------------------------------- The following capital discussion focuses primarily on developments since December 31, 1993. Accordingly, it should be read in conjunction with the Capital section on pages B42 - B44 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. Total stockholders' equity was $11.2 billion at both June 30, 1994 and December 31, 1993, compared with $10.5 billion at June 30, 1993. The amount of stockholders' equity at June 30, 1994 reflected an increase of $676 million in net income generated during the six month period as well as an increase of $200 million from the issuance of Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series L ("Series L Preferred Stock"). These increases were offset by a $506 million reduction in the fair value of available- for-sale securities accounted for under SFAS 115; the net increase in treasury stock of $102 million principally from the aforementioned repurchase of approximately 3.2 million shares of the Corporation's common stock, and common and preferred dividends totaling $257 million. Total capitalization (total stockholders' equity under risk-based capital guidelines and senior subordinated debt that qualifies as Tier 2 Capital) increased by $542 million during the first six months of 1994. LONG-TERM DEBT In the first half of 1994, additions to the Corporation's long-term debt were $1,215 million (including $565 million of medium-term notes, $200 million of subordinated debt that qualifies as Tier 2 Capital and $450 of other long-term debt). These additions were offset by maturities of $895 million of long-term debt (including $255 million of medium-term notes, $315 million of senior notes and $325 million of other long-term debt) and the redemption of $185 million of long-term debt. See Liquidity Management section for further discussion of the Corporation's long-term debt redemptions. COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS In the second quarter of 1994, the Board of Directors of the Corporation declared a $.38 per share quarterly dividend to be paid on its common stock in July 1994. Future dividend policies will be determined by the Board of Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and other factors, including applicable governmental regulations and policies. RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS At June 30, 1994, the Corporation's ratios of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and Total Capital to risk-weighted assets were 8.7% and 12.8%, respectively, well in excess of the minimum ratios specified by the Federal Reserve Board. These ratios, as well as the leverage ratio discussed below, do not reflect any adjustment in stockholders' equity due to the adoption of SFAS No. 115. The Federal Reserve Board has proposed to permit banking corporations to include in Tier 1 Capital the net amount of any unrealized gains or losses from securities available-for-sale. At June 30, 1994, Chemical Bank's ratios of Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital to risk- weighted assets, were 7.8% and 12.2%, respectively. At such date, each of Chemical Bank and Texas Commerce Bank National Association, were "well capitalized," as defined by the Federal Reserve Board. To be "well capitalized," a banking organization must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, Total Capital ratio of at least 10%, and Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%. LEVERAGE RATIOS The Tier 1 leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 Capital (as defined under the risk-based capital guidelines) divided by average total assets (net of allowance for losses, goodwill and certain intangible assets). The minimum leverage ratio is 3% for banking organizations that have well-diversified risk (including no undue interest risk); excellent asset quality; high liquidity; good earnings; and, in general, is considered a strong banking organization -40-  41 Part I Item 2 (continued) (rated composite 1 under the BOPEC rating system for bank holding companies). Other banking organizations are expected to have ratios of at least 4%-5%, depending upon their particular condition and growth plans. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization. The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Corporation of any specific minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to it. The Corporation's Tier I leverage ratio was 6.41% at June 30, 1994, compared with 6.77% at December 31, 1993. At June 30, 1994, Chemical Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.98%, compared with 6.97% at December 31, 1993. The declines in the leverage ratios for both the Corporation and Chemical Bank reflect the adoption of FASI 39 on January 1, 1994. Assuming that FASI 39 had not been adopted, the Corporation's Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 7.11% at June 30, 1994 and Chemical Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio would have been 6.83%. The table which follows sets forth the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital, Tier 2 Capital and risk-weighted assets, and the Corporation's risk-based Tier 1 and Total Capital Ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratios for the dates indicated. CAPITAL AND RATIOS UNDER FEDERAL RESERVE BANK FINAL GUIDELINES ==================================================================== JUNE 30, December 31, (in millions, except ratios) 1994 1993 -------- ------------ TIER 1 CAPITAL Common Stockholders' Equity $ 9,617 $ 9,295 Nonredeemable Preferred Stock 1,854 1,654 Minority Interest 63 66 Less: Goodwill 924 941 Non-Qualifying Intangible Assets 164 211 ------- ------- Tier 1 Capital $ 10,446 $ 9,863 ------- ------- TIER 2 CAPITAL Long-Term Debt Qualifying as Tier 2 $ 3,413 $ 3,437 Qualifying Allowance for Losses 1,519 1,536 ------- ------- Tier 2 Capital $ 4,932 $ 4,973 ------- ------- TOTAL QUALIFYING CAPITAL $ 15,378 $ 14,836 ======= ======= Risk-Weighted Assets (a) $ 120,336 $121,446 Tier 1 Capital Ratio 8.68% 8.12% Total Capital Ratio 12.78% 12.22% Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 6.41% 6.77% [FN] (a) Includes off-balance sheet risk-weighted assets in the amount of $39,773 million, and $36,777 million, respectively, at June 30, 1994 and December 31, 1993. Excluding the Corporation's securities subsidiary, Chemical Securities Inc., the June 30, 1994 ratios of Tier 1 Leverage, Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets and Total Capital to risk-weighted assets were 6.8%, 8.5% and 12.4%, respectively, compared with 7.2%, 7.9% and 11.9%, respectively, at December 31, 1993. ==================================================================== -------------------------------------------------------------------- LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT -------------------------------------------------------------------- The following liquidity management discussion focuses primarily on developments since December 31, 1993. Accordingly, it should be read in conjunction with the Liquidity Management section on pages B44 and B45 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. -41-  42 Part I Item 2 (continued) The primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the Corporation derives from their ability to generate core deposits, which includes all deposits except zero-rate deposits, foreign deposits and certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more. The Corporation considers funds from such sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit base because of the historical stability of such sources of funds. The average core deposits at the Corporation's bank subsidiaries for the first half of 1994 were $59 billion, a decrease from $60 billion for the comparable quarter in 1993. These deposits fund a portion of the Corporation's asset base, thereby reducing the Corporation's reliance on other, more volatile, sources of funds. For the first half of 1994, the Corporation's percentage of average core deposits to average interest-earning assets was 46%, compared with 48% in the first half of 1993. Average core deposits as a percentage of average loans was 79% for the first six months of 1994, compared with 74% for the same period a year ago. In April 1994, Moody's Investors Service raised its rating on the long-term deposits and other senior obligations of Chemical Bank to Aa3 from A1. It also raised the ratings on the Corporation's commercial paper, senior debt, subordinated debt and preferred stock and on Chemical Bank's subordinated debt. The Corporation is an active participant in the capital markets. In addition to issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes, the Corporation raises funds through the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and preferred stock. During the first six months of 1994, the Corporation issued $200 million of preferred stock, $200 million of subordinated debt, $565 million of senior debt through its medium-term note program and $450 million other long-term debt. During the first six months of 1994, the Corporation redeemed $185 million of its long-term debt and announced its intention to redeem all outstanding shares of its Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C ("Series C Preferred Stock"), stated value $12.00 per share. Such redemptions were undertaken by the Corporation in light of its ability (as a result of market conditions in general and the recent upgrades in the Corporation's debt ratings in particular) to access the credit markets on terms more favorable than that of the redeemed debt and preferred stock. These redemptions were part of the Corporation's plan to improve its capital position by achieving lower financing costs, reducing interest-rate risk and lengthening maturities. The Corporation will continue to evaluate the opportunity for future redemptions of debt and of its outstanding preferred stock in light of current market conditions. On May 27, 1994, the Corporation announced its intention to repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common stock on the open market from time to time during the twelve months following such announcement. As of June 30, 1994, the Corporation had repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares of its common stock under this program. On July 15, 1994, the Corporation redeemed all outstanding shares of its Series C Preferred Stock. The redemption price was $12.36 per share (which included a premium of $.36 per share) plus accrued but unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. Approximately 33.7 million shares of the stock were redeemed. A portion of the redemption was funded by net proceeds received from the issuance of the Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series L. The proforma effect on earnings per share as a result of the premium related to the redemption will be a one-time reduction of approximately $0.05 per common share for the 1994 third quarter. The following comments apply to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash and due from banks increased $2.6 billion during the first six months of 1994, as net cash provided by operating and financing activities exceeded net cash used by investing activities. The $2.7 billion net cash provided by financing activities was due to increases in Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds ($8.5 billion), partially offset by decreases in net deposits ($6.3 billion). The $1.2 billion of net cash provided by operating activities was principally due to earnings adjusted for noncash charges and credits. The $1.3 billion net cash used in investing activities was largely the result of cash outflows from purchases of securities ($15.5 billion) and from Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements ($2.2 billion), partially offset by cash inflows from the sales and maturities of securities ($11.3 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively), as well as decreases in deposits with banks ($1.6 billion). -42-  43 Part I Item 2 (continued) Cash and due from banks decreased $1.2 billion during the first six months of 1993, as net cash used in operating and investing activities exceeded the net cash provided by financing activities. The $2.1 billion total net cash used by operating activities was primarily impacted by the net increase in trading related assets ($4.5 billion). The $626 million of net cash used in investing activities was largely the result of cash outflows from purchases of securities ($6.0 billion), as well as increases in deposits with banks ($1.9 billion), and Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements ($1.5 billion), partially offset by cash inflows from the sales and securitizations of loans ($6.3 billion), and maturities and sales of securities ($3.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively). The $1.5 billion net cash provided by financing activities was due to the increase in Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds ($3.3 billion), and the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt ($2.6 billion), partially offset by decreases in noninterest bearing domestic demand deposits ($1.4 billion), domestic time and savings deposits ($1.8 billion). The Corporation's anticipated cash requirements (on a parent company only basis) for the remainder of 1994 include approximately $1,765 million for maturing medium- and long-term debt, redemption of Series C Preferred Stock, anticipated dividend payments on the Corporation's common stock and preferred stock and for other parent company operations. The Corporation considers the sources of liquidity available to the parent company to be more than sufficient to meet its obligations. The sources of liquidity available to the Corporation (on a parent company only basis) include its liquid assets (including deposits with its bank subsidiaries and short-term advances to and repurchase agreements with its securities subsidiaries) as well as dividends or the repayment of intercompany advances from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries. In addition, as of June 30, 1994, the Corporation had available to it $750 million in committed credit facilities from a syndicate of domestic and international banks. The facilities included a $375 million 36- month facility and a $375 million 364-day facility. -------------------------------------------------------------------- OFF-BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS -------------------------------------------------------------------- The following off-balance sheet analysis discussion focuses primarily on developments since December 31, 1993. Accordingly, it should be read in conjunction with the Off-Balance Sheet Analysis section on pages B45 - B48 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. For a discussion of the Corporation's accounting policies related to off-balance sheet instruments, see Note One on page B58 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. The Corporation utilizes various off-balance sheet financial instruments in two ways: trading and asset/liability management. Certain of these instruments, commonly referred to as "derivatives", represent contracts with counterparties where payments are made to or from the counterparty based upon specific interest rates, currency levels, other market rates or on terms predetermined by the contract. Derivatives, along with foreign exchange contracts, can provide a cost-effective alternative to assuming and mitigating risk associated with traditional on-balance sheet instruments. Such derivative and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varying degrees, market risk (i.e., the possibility that a change in interest or currency rates will cause the value of a financial instrument to decrease or become more costly to settle) and credit risk (i.e., the possibility that a loss may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of a contract). Derivatives and foreign exchange products are generally either negotiated over-the-counter ("OTC") contracts or standardized contracts executed on a recognized exchange (such as the Chicago Board of Options Exchange). Standardized exchange-traded derivatives primarily include futures and options. Negotiated over- the-counter derivatives are generally entered into between two counterparties that negotiate specific agreement terms, including the underlying instrument, amount, exercise price and maturity. All the Corporation's interest rate swaps and forwards are OTC- traded and all of the Corporation's financial futures contracts are exchange-traded. As of June 30, 1994, approximately 29% of the Corporation's options activity was exchange-traded, with the balance being OTC-traded. As of December 31, 1993, approximately 53% of the Corporation's options activity was exchange-traded, with the balance being OTC-traded. The percentage of options activity which is exchange-traded versus OTC-traded will change from quarter to quarter depending upon conditions in the market place. -43-  44 Part I Item 2 (continued) Market Risk: The Corporation's business strategy is to manage the market risks associated with its trading activities through geographic and product diversification. Because of the changing market environment, the monitoring and managing of these risks is a continuous process. The Corporation's trading activities are geographically diverse. Trading activities are undertaken in more than 20 countries, although a majority of the Corporation's transactions are executed in the United States, Japan, Singapore and Western Europe, areas which the Corporation believes have the most developed laws regarding derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. The Corporation trades in a wide range of products which include not only foreign exchange and derivatives but also securities, including LDC debt. The effects of any market losses on the Corporation's trading activities have been reflected in trading revenue, as the trading instruments are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Credit Risk: The effective management of credit risk is a vital ingredient of the Corporation's off-balance sheet activities. The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchange product transactions with regulated financial institutions that it believes have relatively low credit risk. At June 30, 1994, approximately 95% of transaction counterparties were commercial banks and financial institutions. Non-financial institutions accounted for only 5% of the Corporation's derivatives counterparties. The great majority of the Corporation's derivatives transactions are with counterparties that are banks and financial institutions which are dealers of derivatives. The majority of derivatives and foreign exchange transactions are outstanding for less than one year. At June 30, 1994, 34% of outstanding transactions were scheduled to expire within three months, 20% within three to six months, 17% within six months to one year, 16% within one to three years and 13% greater than three years. The short-term nature of these transactions mitigates credit risk as transactions settle quickly. The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from derivatives and foreign exchange transactions in past years have been immaterial. During 1994 there were no credit losses. Additionally, at June 30, 1994, nonperforming derivatives contracts were immaterial. The Corporation does not deal, to any material extent, in derivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions) which dealers of derivatives consider to be "complex" (i.e., exotic and/or leveraged). As a result, the notional amount of such derivatives were immaterial at June 30, 1994. INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The Corporation's net interest income is affected by changes in the level of market interest rates based upon mismatches between the repricing of its assets and liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity arises in the ordinary course of the Corporation's banking business as the repricing characteristics of its loans do not necessarily match those of its deposits and other borrowings. This sensitivity can be altered by adjusting investments and the maturities of wholesale funding and with the use of off-balance sheet derivatives instruments. The Corporation, as part of its asset/liability management program, does utilize derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps. These swaps are utilized to adjust the interest rate risk of specific assets, long-term debt and groups of similar assets and similar deposits. Management uses a variety of techniques to measure its interest rate sensitivity. One such tool is aggregate net gap analysis, an example of which is presented below. Assets and liabilities are placed in maturity ladders based on their contractual maturities or repricing dates. Assets and liabilities for which no specific contractual maturity or repricing dates exist are placed in ladders based on management's judgments concerning their most likely repricing behaviors. -44-  45 Part I Item 2 (continued) At June 30, 1994, the Corporation had $9,860 million more liabilities than assets repricing within one year, amounting to 5.8% of total assets. This compares with $7,912 million of more liabilities than assets repricing, or 5.3% of total assets, at December 31, 1993. At June 30, 1994, based on the Corporation's simulation models, which are comprehensive simulations of net interest income under a variety of market interest rate scenarios, net interest income sensitivity to a gradual 150 basis point rise in market rates over the next twelve months was estimated at less than 2% of projected 1994 after-tax net income. For the 1994 second quarter and first six months, the impact on net interest income attributable to the Corporation's end-user derivative activities was approximately $59 million and $119 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of open derivative contracts (which are primarily interest rate swaps) used for asset/liability management activities at June 30, 1994 reflected a net unrealized loss of $268 million, compared with a net unrealized gain of $425 million at December 31, 1993. The decrease is primarily due to the recent increases in interest rates. The above unrealized loss does not include the favorable impact of the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts. At June 30, 1994, gross deferred gains were $53 million and gross deferred losses were $38 million relating to closed financial futures contracts used in end-user derivative activities. Deferred gains and losses on closed financial futures contracts are amortized over periods ranging from six to nine months depending on when the contract is closed and the period of time over which the liability was being hedged. The Corporation does not generally terminate its interest rate swaps. As of June 30, 1994, the Corporation did not have any deferred gains or losses related to terminated interest rate swap contracts. -45-  46 Part I Item 2 (continued) INTEREST RATE SWAPS Interest rate swaps are one of the various financial instruments used in the Corporation's asset/liability management activities. Although the Corporation believes the results of its asset/liability management activities should be evaluated on an integrated basis, taking into consideration all on- and related off-balance sheet instruments and not a specific financial instrument, the interest rate tables below do provide an indication of the Corporation's interest rate swap activity. The table that follows summarizes the expected maturities and weighted-average interest rates to be received and paid on domestic and international interest rate swaps utilized in the Corporation's asset/liability management at June 30, 1994. The table was prepared under the assumption that variable interest rates remain constant at June 30, 1994 levels and, accordingly, the actual interest rates to be received or paid will be different to the extent that such variable rates fluctuate from June 30, 1994 levels. Variable rates presented are generally based on the short-term interest rates for the relevant currencies (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)). Basis swaps are interest rate swaps based on two floating rate indices. -46-  47 Part I Item 2 (continued) -------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS -------------------------------------------------------------------- ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS 114"). SFAS 114 requires that the carrying value of impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Under the new standard, a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay contractual interest or principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. SFAS 114 is applicable to all loans that are identified for evaluation, uncollateralized as well as collateralized, with certain exceptions. SFAS 114 applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. Management believes that the adoption of SFAS 114 will not have a material effect on the Corporation's earnings, liquidity or capital resources. -------------------------------------------------------------------- SUPERVISION AND REGULATION -------------------------------------------------------------------- The following supervision and regulation discussion focuses primarily on developments since December 31, 1993 and should be read in conjunction with the Supervision and Regulation section on pages A3-A8 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993. -47-  48 Part I Item 2 (continued) DIVIDENDS Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries of the Corporation that are state member banks of the Federal Reserve System (a "state member bank") or are national banks. Two different calculations are performed to measure the amounts of dividends that may be paid: a "recent earnings" test and an "undivided profits" test. New York State banks like Chemical Bank are also subject to substantially similar restrictions of the New York State Banking Department. Non-bank subsidiaries of the Corporation are not subject to such limitations. At June 30, 1994, in accordance with the dividend restrictions applicable to them, the Corporation's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant banking regulators, pay dividends of approximately $1.9 billion to their respective bank holding companies, plus an additional amount equal to their net profits from July 1, 1994 through the date in 1994 of any such dividend payment. In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. FDICIA On December 19, 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") was enacted. Among other things, FDICIA requires the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC deposit insurance. FDICIA also contains provisions limiting certain activities and business methods of depository institutions. Finally, FDICIA provides for expanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by such institutions' appropriate Federal banking regulator. Chemical Bank and Texas Commerce Bank, National Association were each "well capitalized" as that term is defined under the various regulations promulgated under FDICIA and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect such regulations to have a material adverse impact on their business operations. -------------------------------------------------------------------- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS -------------------------------------------------------------------- On May 12, 1994, the Corporation, through Chemical Bank National Association, a wholly-owned bank subsidiary of the Corporation, signed a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding preferred and common shares of Margaretten Financial Corporation. Margaretten is the parent company of one of the nation's leading mortgage banking firms, Margaretten & Company, Inc., whose primary business is the origination, purchase, sale and servicing of residential mortgage loans. Under the terms of the agreement, a cash tender offer was made for all outstanding shares of Margaretten common stock at $25 per share, and all outstanding depositary shares representing 8-1/4% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, at $25 per depositary share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The tender offer was conditioned on, among other things, a minimum of 80% of the outstanding Margaretten common shares being validly tendered and not withdrawn. As of midnight on June 30, 1994, when the offer expired, approximately 99% and 95% of outstanding Margaretten common shares and depositary shares, respectively, had been tendered and not withdrawn. The remaining shares of common stock and depositary shares were converted to cash through a merger effective on July 22, 1994. -48-  49 Part I Item 2 (continued) On July 20, 1994, the Corporation announced a definitive agreement through which Bank of America, FSB, a BankAmerica Corporation subsidiary, will acquire Margaretten's mortgage servicing operations located in Richmond, Virginia. The sale to Bank of America, FSB, will include the assumption of the lease and fixed assets of the Richmond facility as well as servicing rights to a portion of the portfolio of GNMA and other loans that are serviced at that facility. The agreement is expected to close in the 1994 third quarter, and is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the obtaining of any necessary regulatory approvals. The Corporation intends to integrate the remaining Margaretten facilities into its existing operations and run its mortgage banking activities on a consolidated basis. On August 2, 1994, the Corporation and Mellon Bank announced that they had signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture that will focus exclusively on providing stock transfer and related shareholder services to publicly-held companies. The joint venture, which will be called Chemical Mellon Shareholder Services, will be a 50/50 partnership, with Mellon Bank and the Corporation sharing equally in the joint venture's initial capitalization, including investments in new technology. The joint venture's product line will include traditional stock transfer services, proxy tabulation and the administration of dividend reinvestment plans, as well as proxy solicitation programs, corporate reorganization processing, the development and administration of employee stock option plans, and a comprehensive stock watch monitoring service. The joint venture is expected to become operational by January 1995. The Corporation currently offers shareholder services through its Regional Bank's Geoserve division. -49-  50 Part I Item 2 (continued) -50-  51 Part I Item 2 (continued) -51-  52 Part I Item 2 (continued) CHEMICAL BANKING CORPORATION and Subsidiaries QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) -52-
