 16Part IItem 2 (continued)The impact from the amortization of intangibles was $0.08 per share in the firstquarter of 2001 and $0.05 per share one year ago. The annualized cash operatingreturn on common equity was 15.6% for the first quarter of 2001.Management tracks the operating performance of JPMorgan Chase both including andexcluding JPMorgan Partners' results. Over the past few years, volatile stockmarkets have yielded significant fluctuations in the market values of thesecurities held by JPMorgan Partners, resulting in unrealized valuationadjustments for a given period which have significantly affected, both favorablyand unfavorably, the Firm's operating results.OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001:JPMorgan Chase's diversified product capabilities enabled the Firm to gainmarket share during the competitive market environment of the first quarter of2001. Disciplined expense management efforts are reflected in the overalldecline in expenses during the first quarter of 2001. - The Investment Bank, Treasury & Securities Services and Retail & Middle Market Financial Services posted solid results in a weak environment, while JPMorgan Partners and Investment Management & Private Banking were adversely affected by the stock market decline. - Total operating expenses declined by 3% from the fourth quarter and by 5% from the first quarter of 2000 on a pro forma basis (pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000). - The Investment Bank continued to gain market share in global mergers and acquisitions ("M&A") advisory and high-grade bond and syndicated loan underwriting; however, there was a decline in market share in equity underwriting.Nonperforming assets totaled $2.23 billion at March 31, 2001, compared with$1.92 billion and $1.84 billion at December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2000,respectively. The increase from December 31, 2000 primarily related to threedomestic commercial loans. The allowance for loan losses as of March 31, 2001was $3.67 billion, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2000. The reportedprovision for loan losses and net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2001 wereeach $447 million.Total assets as of March 31, 2001 were $714 billion, compared with $715 billionas of December 31, 2000 and $676 billion at March 31, 2000. JPMorgan Chase'sTier One Capital ratio grew to 8.7% at March 31, 2001, compared with 8.5% atDecember 31, 2000.JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2001 special items were $212 million (after-tax)of merger and restructuring costs and the cumulative effect of a transitionadjustment of negative $25 million (after-tax) related to the adoption of SFAS133 relating to the accounting for derivative instruments and hedgingactivities. There were no special items in the first quarter of 2000.KEY BUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001: - JPMORGAN PARTNERS ("JPMP") had private equity gains of $132 million in the first quarter. Realized gains of $412 million on sales of public and private investments were partially offset by net unrealized losses of $280 million. The unrealized losses represented both revaluation writedowns in the private portfolio and a net decline in the value of the public portfolio. Realized gains included write-offs in the private portfolio. - The INVESTMENT BANK'S operating revenues were $4.47 billion in the first quarter of 2001. Investment Banking fees totaled $939 million, and trading revenues increased 64% from the fourth quarter of 2000. JPMorgan Chase ranked No. 3 in global announced M&A transactions at the end of the first quarter of 2001, up from No. 6 in full-year 2000, and finished the first quarter ranked No. 2 in U.S. investment grade bond underwriting. The Firm, however, experienced a decline to No. 9 in its ranking in U.S. equity underwriting. - RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICES' operating revenues were $2.57 billion in the first quarter of 2001. The business experienced record origination volumes in mortgage and auto, a 24% increase in credit card earnings (compared with the first quarter of 2000) reflecting higher revenue from an increase in new accounts during the last three quarters, and deposit growth of 5% in both retail and middle market. -16-  17Part IItem 2 (continued) - INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKING had operating revenues of $807 million and achieved net positive cash flows in the first quarter of 2001. However, market conditions led to a decline in assets under management from $685 billion at March 31, 2000, on a pro forma basis, to $608 billion at the end of the first quarter. - TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICES' operating revenues in the first quarter of 2001 were $907 million, reflecting lower asset-based fees and declining short-term interest rates. Offsetting these pressures were new business generated and higher volumes in the Institutional Trust Services and Treasury Services businesses.MERGER UPDATE: - The merger of Chase Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. occurred on May 1, 2001. The merger of The Chase Manhattan Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York currently is scheduled to occur in October 2001. - JPMC's management remains confident about merger progress to date. Merger integration is going well, and client receptivity to the Firm's expanded product capabilities has been encouraging. Because of the lead-time between mandate and transaction execution, this progress is only partially evidenced by the market share gains achieved by the Firm during the first quarter of 2001. - Because realization of revenue synergies from the merger was dependent upon more "normalized" markets, JPMC's management anticipates that revenue synergies from the merger for full year 2001 are likely to be lower than previously estimated if merger and acquisition and equity underwriting activity continue throughout the remainder of the year at the same levels as that for the 2001 first quarter. -17-  18Part IItem 2 (continued)LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSThe table below provides summary financial information on a cash operating basisfor the five major business segments. All periods below have been restated on acomparable basis to reflect the changes in capital allocation adopted in thefirst quarter of 2001; restatements may occur in future periods to reflectfurther alignment of management accounting policies.The information that follows generally discusses the lines of businessresults comparing the first quarter of 2001 with the first quarter of 2000.However, as the Investment Bank's results for the first quarter of 2001 weresignificantly different from the fourth quarter of 2000, the discussion thatfollows provides comparative information from fourth quarter, as well as from2000 first quarter, results.During the first quarter of 2001, JPMorgan Chase adopted a new framework forcapital allocation and for business performance measurement across the Firm. TheSVA framework now utilizes a 12% cost of equity capital for each business, withthe exception of JPMorgan Partners. This business is charged a 15% cost ofequity capital, which is equivalent to a representative after-tax hurdle ratefor private equity investments. Overall, the effective cost of equity capitalused in the SVA framework for JPMorgan Chase is 12%. See Management PerformanceMeasurements in the MD&A on page 25 and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 AnnualReport for a further discussion of performance measurements and policies forcost allocation.(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Robert Fleming Holdings Limited ("Flemings") occurred at the beginning of 2000.(b) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. -18-  19Part IItem 2 (continued) (c) SVA is JPMorgan Chase's primary performance measure of its businesses. SVA represents operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles (i.e. cash operating earnings), minus preferred dividends and an explicit charge for capital. (d) Column includes LabMorgan, Support Units and the effects remaining at the corporate level after the implementation of management accounting policies. bp - Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%. NM - Not meaningful. -19-  20Part IItem 2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the Investment Bank, see pages 28-29of the JPMorgan Chase 2000 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of the Investment Bank.(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at thebeginning of 2000.The Investment Bank's operating revenues were $4.47 billion in the first quarterof 2001, reflecting a 7% decline from the first quarter of 2000 pro forma forFlemings and a 21% increase from the fourth quarter of 2000. Cash operatingexpenses declined 4% from pro forma results for the first quarter of 2000 and 6%from the fourth quarter of 2000, benefiting from reduced levels of incentivecompensation. When compared with the fourth quarter of 2000, the InvestmentBank's cash operating expense also reflected lower levels of noncompensationexpense. Cash operating earnings were $1.06 billion in the first quarter of2001, compared with $1.23 billion in the first quarter of 2000 pro forma forFlemings and $498 million in the fourth quarter of 2000.Trading revenues (including related net interest income ("NII")) of $2.09billion in the first quarter declined by 3% from the strong trading results inthe pro forma first quarter of 2000. Higher trading revenues in the Firm'sinterest rate derivatives and government securities businesses offset lowerresults in emerging markets and foreign exchange. Trading revenues rose 64% or$816 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting higher revenues acrossvirtually all of the Firm's trading activities. Equity revenues of $555 millionin the first quarter of 2001 more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2000.Higher equity derivative revenues from an increase in client transactions andhigher market volatility was the primary reason for the increase from the fourthquarter of 2000.Investment banking fees totaled $939 million, which represented a 24% and 10%decline from the pro forma first quarter and fourth quarter of 2000,respectively. Weak market conditions in equity capital markets and M&A (incontrast with extremely strong markets during the first quarter of 2000)resulted in lower equity underwriting and advisory fees. These declines werepartially offset by higher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees.Fees and commissions of $457 million in the first quarter of 2001 were 13% belowpro forma first quarter 2000. The decline reflected lower equity brokeragecommissions as a result of lower market volume.Included in all other revenue were securities gains of $166 million in the firstquarter of 2001 reflecting the successful execution of the Firm'sasset/liability management activities in a declining interest rate environment.Management of the Investment Bank intends to reduce the Investment Bank'sexpenses in 2001 from the pro forma 2000 level (pro forma includes expenses ofFlemings for fiscal year 2000) and, given the current revenue outlook for oneyear, is committed to taking more aggressive expense management steps thanpreviously planned. -20-  21Part IItem 2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMorgan Partners, see pages 32-33of the JPMorgan Chase 2000 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of JPMorgan Partners.NM - Not meaningful.JPMORGAN PARTNERS generated net private equity gains of $132 million in thefirst quarter of 2001, compared with gains of $654 million in the first quarterof 2000. Included in the first quarter 2001 results were $412 million inrealized gains from public and private positions, compared with realized gainsof $392 million in the first quarter of 2000. The realized gains were partiallyoffset by net unrealized losses in the first quarter of $280 million,representing both revaluation writedowns in the private portfolio and a netdecline in the value of the public portfolio.The first quarter of 2001 was characterized by a challenging market thatprovided limited exit opportunities. Successful investment realizations in theenergy and power sector were significant contributors to JPMP's performance inthis environment.The Firm's management believes that JPMP's private equity business hasestablished a strong track record of providing substantial contributions toJPMC's earnings over time. However, because of the volatile nature of the publicequities market, and that of the NASDAQ market in particular, JPMP's reportedresults may include significant unrealized valuation adjustments, both favorableand unfavorable, at any given period. In 2001, JPMP may experience furtherunrealized losses in both the publicly-held and privately-held portions of itsportfolio because the current environment for financings and valuation levels,particularly for telecommunications companies, may require JPMP to write downsuch investments.The amount of realized gains recognized by JPMP in 2001 will depend upon JPMP'sability to implement its various "exit" strategies, which will be affected by anumber of conditions, including the liquidity of the financial markets, thelevel and volatility of the public equities markets, and investor sentiment.Management believes that under current market conditions, net realized gains forJPMP for full year 2001 are likely to be lower than net realized gains in 2000.Net realized gains include gains realized on the sale of investments, as well asrealized losses recognized upon write-offs of investments. -21-  22Part IItem 2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOThe following table presents the carrying values and costs of the JPMPinvestment portfolio for the dates indicated.(a) Publicly traded positions only.(b) Represents the number of companies and funds at March 31, 2001.The following table presents information about the 10 largest holdings of publicsecurities in the JPMP investment portfolio.PUBLIC SECURITIES INVESTMENTS AT MARCH 31, 2001 (a)(a) Policy: Public securities held by JPMorgan Partners are marked-to-market at the quoted public value less liquidity discounts, with the resulting unrealized gains/losses included in the income statement. JPMorgan Partners' valuation policy for public securities incorporates the use of liquidity discounts and price averaging methodologies in certain circumstances to take into account the fact that JPMorgan Partners cannot immediately realize the quoted public values as a result of the regulatory, corporate and contractual sales restrictions generally imposed on these holdings. Private investments are initially carried at cost, which is viewed as an approximation of fair value. The carrying value of private investments is adjusted to reflect valuation changes resulting from unaffiliated party transactions and for evidence of a decline in value.The carrying values of the equity investments recorded on JPMC's financialstatements are net of interests of investors other than JPMC. JPMP has soldinterests in certain of its fund investments to unaffiliated third parties andis in the process of offering interests in a new investment fund that willco-invest with JPMP in its direct investments. As a result, JPMC's proportionalownership share of investments made, and to be made by JPMP in the future, willbe reduced.The Firm believes JPMP's equity-related investments will continue tocreate long-term value for JPMC. The Firm has invested $0.3 billion in JPMPinvestments in the first quarter of 2001, and is prepared to commit up to anadditional $1.7 billion of its own capital for investment by JPMP this year. Inaddition, the Firm has committed at least $1.5 billion of its own capital toJPMP in each of the next four years. -22-  23Part IItem 2 (continued)INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a description of Investment Management & Private Banking ("IMPB") and adiscussion of the profiles for each business, see page 30 of JPMorgan Chase's2000 Annual Report.The following table reflects selected financial data for IMPB.(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.IMPB had operating revenues of $807 million, down 23% from the pro forma firstquarter of 2000. This decline reflected both the record performance of Flemingsand Hambrecht & Quist ("H&Q") brokerage in the first quarter of 2000 and thepressures in the 2001 first quarter market environment on commissions, mutualfund loads and management fees.IMPB's cash operating expenses of $682 million declined 6% from the pro formalevel in the first quarter of 2000. Cash operating earnings were $102 million,down from the pro forma level of $207 million in the first quarter of 2000.The table below reflects the assets under management in IMPB as of March 31,2001 and 2000, respectively.(a) Pro forma results assume that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.Market conditions in the first quarter of 2001 led to an 11% decline in assetsunder management from the first quarter of 2000 pro forma level. This excludesassets managed in other lines of business and assets attributable to the Firm's45% interest in American Century. -23-  24Part IItem 2 (continued)TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within Treasury & SecuritiesServices ("T&SS"), see page 31 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.The following table sets forth selected financial data of Treasury & SecuritiesServices.Treasury & Securities Services' operating revenues rose to $907 million in thefirst quarter, a 5% increase from last year's first quarter. The first quarterof 2000 was itself a strong quarter reflecting high transaction volumefollowing completion of Y2K efforts. The Institutional Trust business showedparticular strength this year as revenues advanced 17%, driven by higher feesrelated to new and existing business and increased balances. Cash expensesincreased 1% year-over-year. The combination of modest revenue growth andexpense management led to cash operating earnings of $177 million, 13% higherthan in the first quarter of 2000.Management expects continued revenue growth in the three businesses constitutingT&SS for full year 2001. Under current market conditions revenue growth in thesecurities businesses of T&SS may be slower in 2001 than in 2000. Expensediscipline will continue, and management has targeted a cash overhead ratio,over time, of approximately 65%.RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of Retail & Middle Market Financial Services ("RMMFS") and adiscussion of the profiles for each business, see pages 34-35 of JPMorganChase's 2000 Annual Report.The following table reflects selected financial data for RMMFS.NM - Not meaningful.Operating revenues for RMMFS increased to $2.57 billion, an increase of 7% overthe first quarter of 2000. Cash operating expenses were flat from the firstquarter of 2000. Cash operating earnings totaled $443 million in the firstquarter, an increase of 28% from the first quarter of 2000, reflecting thebenefit of favorable operating leverage.Management has a goal of double-digit cash operating earnings growth for RMMFSfor 2001. However, current volatility in mortgage rates may adversely affectthe financial results of RMMFS. -24-  25Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within RMMFS.NM - Not meaningful.CARDMEMBER SERVICESCardmember Services' cash operating earnings for the first quarter of 2001 wereup 24%, when compared with the first quarter of 2000, reflecting higher revenuefrom an increase in new accounts during the last three quarters. Credit cardoutstandings of $36.5 billion were more than $4 billion greater than in the sameperiod a year ago.REGIONAL BANKING GROUPRegional Banking Group's revenues were essentially flat with the first quarterof 2000, and cash operating earnings declined by 3%. These results reflect a 5%growth in deposit levels in consumer banking and the small business sector,offset by the adverse effects of declining interest rates on deposit margins andlower investment brokerage volume due to market conditions.HOME FINANCEHome Finance's operating revenues and cash operating earnings increased 7% and22%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2001 over the same period in theprior year. Doubling of origination volume, a 21% growth in servicing balances,higher net interest margin and revenue generated by the acquisition of Advanta'smortgage business were the primary factors driving these results. Mortgageservicing fees in the first quarter of 2001 were reduced by approximately $335million in servicing impairment. This reduction was largely offset by therealization of $315 million in securities gains used to economically hedge theservicing asset. Originations (residential, home equity and manufacturedhousing) for the first quarter of 2001 were $32 billion and includedoriginations from the retail, wholesale and correspondent (traditional andnegotiated) channels. The mortgage servicing portfolio was $392 billion at March31, 2001.MIDDLE MARKETSMiddle Markets' operating revenues were $281 million, an increase of 3% from thefirst quarter of 2000. Cash operating earnings increased in the period by 7% to$72 million. These results reflect deposit growth of 5%. Narrowing spreads ondeposits were offset by better spreads on loans. Fee growth was nearly 6% aheadof last year as the declining value of deposits resulted in higher fees in lieuof balances. Expenses were essentially flat.AUTO FINANCEAuto Finance's operating revenue and cash operating earnings were $110 millionand $22 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2001. Growth waspositively affected by a record number of auto originations, the impact of lowerinterest rates, and the impact of a $100 million decrease in the estimated autolease residual value recognized in the 2000 first quarter.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's support units include LabMorgan, Enterprise Technology Servicesand Corporate Business Services. For a further discussion of the businessprofiles of these Support Units as well as a description of Corporate, see page36 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.For the first quarter of 2001, Support Units and Corporate had a cash operatingloss of $147 million, compared with a cash operating loss of $61 million in thefirst quarter of 2000. Included in the first quarter of 2001 was a net loss of$50 million at LabMorgan primarily as a result of investment write-offs ofapproximately $50 million (pre-tax). Prior periods have been restated to reflectrefinements in management reporting policies or changes to the managementorganization. -25-  26Part IItem 2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations both on an as reported basis and on an operating basis. The tablebelow provides a reconciliation between the Firm's reported and operatingresults.(a) Represents condensed results as reported in JPMorgan Chase's financial statements.(b) This column excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. For receivables that have been securitized, amounts that would have been reported as net interest income and as provision for loan losses are instead reported as components of noninterest revenue.(c) Includes merger and restructuring costs and special items. The 2001 first quarter includes $328 million (pre-tax) in merger and restructuring expenses.(d) Includes the effect of the accounting change. Excluding the accounting change, basic and diluted net income per share were $0.61 and $0.59, respectively; basic and diluted cash earnings per share were $0.70 and $0.68, respectively. -26-  27Part IItem 2 (continued)REVENUES(a) Pro forma revenue assumes that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.INVESTMENT BANKING FEESInvestment banking fees totaled $941 million, representing a decline of 21% fromthe first quarter of 2000. The decline reflected the effect of weak marketconditions in the equity capital markets and in M&A activity, resulting in lowerequity underwriting and advisory fees. These declines were partially offset byhigher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees.TRADING-RELATED REVENUEFor the first quarter of 2001, trading-related revenue, including related netinterest income, declined only slightly from the strong results of the sameperiod a year ago. Revenue in the 2001 first quarter was favorably affected bythe reduction in U.S. interest rates, which provided volatility and liquidity,particularly in the markets for equities and interest rate contracts.(a) Includes equity securities and equity derivatives revenue.(b) Includes instruments such as bonds and commercial paper issued by U.S. and non-U.S. entities, as well as credit derivatives revenue.(c) Includes foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives revenue.(d) Includes various types of interest rate swaps and interest rate derivatives revenue, coupled with commodities and all other trading revenues.(e) Derivative and foreign exchange contracts are marked-to-market and valuation adjustments are included in trading revenue.(f) Includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions, as well as management allocations, reflecting the funding costs or benefits associated with trading positions. These amounts are included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. -27-  28Part IItem 2 (continued) - Equities revenues of $577 million increased 2% from the first quarter of 2000. - Revenues related to debt instruments declined to $299 million in the first quarter of 2001 from $398 million in the comparable period a year earlier. The decline reflected the relatively less active environment for debt instruments in 2001. - Foreign exchange trading revenues were $249 million in 2001, compared with $342 million in the first quarter of 2000, reflecting a slower market for foreign exchange in the current quarter. - First quarter 2001 revenues of $876 million in interest rate contracts, commodities and other showed a significant gain of 32% over first quarter 2000. These gains were primarily the result of strong profits from the trading of interest rate contracts. This market was favorably affected by the liquidity resulting from the reduction in interest rates during the first quarter.FEES AND COMMISSIONSFees and commissions for first quarter 2001 decreased 5%, when compared withfirst quarter 2000. The table below provides the significant components of feesand commissions.Investment Management, Custody and Processing ServicesInvestment management, custody and processing services fees in the first quarterof 2001 rose 22% from the prior year's quarter to $974 million. The increase ininvestment management fees for first quarter 2001, up $144 million from thefirst quarter of 2000, is primarily attributable to the increase in the level offunds under management as a result of the Flemings acquisition. Custody andprocessing services also were higher in first quarter of 2001 than in the samequarter of the previous year. This increase was due to the higher value ofsecurities under custody and the increase in flows of investments to foreignmarkets.Credit Card RevenueCredit card fees on an operating basis for the 2001 first quarter increased $56million, when compared with the prior year's first quarter. This increasereflected higher interchange income due to stronger customer purchase volume,increased late charges as a result of a rise in delinquencies, and higheroverlimit and balance consolidation fees as a result of new pricing initiatives.The following table reconciles JPMorgan Chase's reported credit card revenue andoperating credit card revenue (which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations).Brokerage and Investment ServicesIn comparison with the first quarter of 2000, brokerage and investment servicesfees in the first quarter of 2001 increased $37 million reflecting the effectsof the Flemings acquisition, partly offset by lower commissions associated withthe weaker market environment. -28-  29Part IItem 2 (continued)Mortgage Servicing FeesMortgage servicing fees declined $383 million from the first quarter of 2000,reflecting impairment writedowns and a higher amortization level for mortgageservicing revenue due to declining interest rates.Other Lending-Related Service FeesThe decline in other lending-related service fees of 13% from the first quarterof last year was partly attributable to lower commissions on trade financingactivities as a result of lower market volume and to more modest sales programsfor letters of credit.PRIVATE EQUITY GAINSPrivate equity gains in the first quarter of 2001 were $127 million, comparedwith gains of $674 million in the same quarter of 2000 which is presently drivenfrom the JPMP business unit. Included in the first quarter of 2001 were $412million of realized gains from the sale of public and private securities,compared with $392 million in the first quarter of 2000. The realized gainsin the first quarter of 2001 were partially offset by net unrealizedmark-to-market losses of $285 million, representing both revaluation writedownsin the private portfolio and a net decline in the value of the public portfolio.SECURITIES GAINSSecurities gains realized in the first quarter of 2001 were $455 million,compared with losses of $3 million in the prior year's quarter. The results inthe first quarter of 2001 reflected gains of $315 million on the sale ofsecurities used as economic hedges for the value of mortgage servicing rights.Also contributing to the favorable results were higher gains on U.S. and Eurosecurities sales in line with the Firm's strategy to realign its asset/liabilitypositions.OTHER REVENUEGreater revenue from residential mortgage activities (which includeoriginations, sales of loans, and selective dispositions of mortgage servicingrights) in the 2001 first quarter reflected significantly higher gains on thesale of mortgage loans resulting from higher sold-loan volume.All other revenue decreased 45% in the first quarter of this year, when comparedwith the same period in 2000, primarily due to mark-to-market gains realized inthe first quarter of 2000 on economic hedges for anticipated overseas revenues.These gains were partly offset by gains on the sale in the current quarter of acustody business and several former retail properties in New York, as well as aretail business in Texas.NET INTEREST INCOMEOPERATING NII adjusts reported NII for the impact of credit card securitizationsand trading-related NII that is considered part of total trading-relatedrevenue. The following table reconciles reported and operating NII. -29-  30Part IItem 2 (continued)Reported NII was $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2001, flat when comparedwith the first quarter of 2000. Reported average interest earning assets rose12% to $547.6 billion while the reported net yield on interest-earning assetsdeclined 20 basis points to 1.80%. Operating NII increased 3% to $2.6 billionwhen compared with the first quarter of 2000. Operating NII in the first quarterof 2001 was affected favorably by the addition of Flemings. Included in bothreported and operating NII in the first quarter of 2000 was a $100 milliondecrease in the estimated auto lease residual value, which was accounted for asa reduction in NII.NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal operating noninterest expense was $5.60 billion, up 5% from the firstquarter of 2000. The increase over the first quarter of 2000 reflected thehigher investments in resources to build the platform of the Investment Bank,including the acquisition of Flemings. Total noninterest expenses for the firstquarter of 2001 was 5% less than pro forma first quarter 2000. The decrease inoperating noninterest expenses from pro forma first quarter 2000 reflected theoverall reduction in operating expenses due to merger-related savings as well asexpense management. The following table presents the components of noninterestexpense on a cash, operating and reported basis.(a) Pro forma expense assumes that the purchase of Flemings occurred at the beginning of 2000.(b) The overhead ratio is noninterest expense as a percentage of the total of net interest income and noninterest revenue (excluding merger and restructuring costs and special items). The cash overhead ratio also excludes the impact of amortization of intangibles.Management of JPMC is targeting cash operating expenses for full-year 2001 to belower than cash operating expenses for full year 2000 (pro forma includingexpenses of Flemings for full-year 2000).COMPENSATION EXPENSECompensation expense of $3.4 billion increased 1% from the first quarter of2000, reflecting higher salaries and benefits, offset by lower incentive costs.The increase in full-time equivalent employees was attributable to theacquisition of Flemings and the mortgage business of Advanta Corp. ("Advanta").OCCUPANCY EXPENSEOccupancy expense increased from the first quarter of 2000 due to additionalleasing costs in New York, and leasing costs for office space occupied byFlemings.TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONSTechnology and communications expense increased over the prior-year firstquarter period due to the amortization of software related to the implementationof sophisticated product systems used in JPMorgan Chase's businesses. The higheramount also reflects the acquisition of Flemings. -30-  31Part IItem 2 (continued)OTHER EXPENSEOther expense rose 3% from the first quarter of 2000. The following tablepresents the components of other expense. - The increase in PROFESSIONAL SERVICES for the first quarter of 2001 over the first quarter of 2000 was primarily attributable to higher costs associated with applications and systems consulting services. - The increase in OUTSIDE SERVICES was principally driven by higher outside data processing fees related to the rise in volume of activities at Investor Services, as well as offsite contingency fees for investment banking operations. - MARKETING increased due to the higher number of direct marketing initiatives at Cardmember Services. - The increase in TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT is attributable to the increase in travel and hotel expenses associated with the heightened levels of business activities at the Investment Bank as well as activities related to the merger. - All Other expenses decreased by $24 million primarily as a result of a decline in operating losses.AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLESAmortization of intangibles for the first quarter of 2001 increased from thesame quarter a year ago as a result of the acquisitions of Flemings and Beaconin the third quarter of 2000.MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTSDuring the first quarter of 2001, the Firm incurred $328 million ofrestructuring costs relating to previously announced merger actions ($274million) and relocation and other business initiatives ($54 million). Undercurrent accounting pronouncements, these costs (primarily systems integrationcosts, facilities costs and retention payments) are not recognized untilincurred. For a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase's merger and restructuringcosts, refer to Note 7 and page 42 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs on an operating basis are composed of the provision for loan lossesrelated to loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to the credit costsassociated with credit card receivables that have been securitized.Credit costs increased in the first quarter of 2001, when compared with firstquarter of 2000 as a result of the increases in charge-offs in the retainedportfolio, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in charge-offs onsecuritized credit cards. See page 36 for a discussion of the allowance forcredit losses.INCOME TAXESJPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of $656 million on income beforeeffect of accounting change in the first quarter of 2001, compared with $1.09billion in the first quarter of 2000. The effective tax rates were 35.0% and35.3%, respectively. -31-  32Part IItem 2 (continued)RISK MANAGEMENTJPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational andliquidity risk. For a discussion of these risks and definitions of termsassociated with managing these risks, please refer to the Glossary of Terms onpage 47 of this Form 10-Q and pages 43-59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 AnnualReport.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk management focusesprimarily on developments since December 31, 2000 and should be read inconjunction with pages 46-53 and 67-68 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm's credit-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Charge-offs for derivative receivables are included in trading revenue.(b) Includes credit card receivables that have been securitized.(c) Nonperforming assets have not been reduced for credit protection (single name credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) aggregating $107 million related to nonperforming counterparties.(d) Annualized.JPMorgan Chase's managed credit-related assets of $312 billion at March 31, 2001increased 1% when compared with year-end 2000. Commercial loans decreased $6.2billion reflecting the Firm's discipline of originating loans for distributionand its portfolio hedging activities. Derivative and foreign exchangeinstruments increased a modest 3%. Consumer managed credit-related assetsincreased $5.7 billion, largely in the 1-4 family residential mortgageportfolio. JPMorgan Chase's credit-related portfolio continues to be relativelywell-balanced between commercial and consumer assets, with consumer assetscomprising approximately 38% of JPMorgan Chase's managed credit-relatedportfolio, compared with 37% at year-end 2000. The portion of the commercialportfolio considered investment grade was 65% at March 31, 2001, down from 67%at year-end 2000.The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily related to three domesticcommercial credits. Management currently believes that credit conditions in theUnited States will remain challenging over the remainder of the year, causingnonperforming assets to increase further in 2001. However, management believesthat JMPC's credit performance this year will continue to be better than theindustry average.Net charge-offs in the managed portfolio were $688 million in the first quarterof 2001, an increase of $101 million from the first quarter of 2000, reflectingincreased net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio. -32-  33Part IItem 2 (continued)For full-year 2001, management expects the commercial net charge-off rate tofall within the targeted range of 40-60 basis points of JPMC's commercial loanportfolio.COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO(a) Charge-offs for derivative receivables are included in trading revenue.(b) Nonperforming assets have not been reduced for credit protection (single name credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) aggregating $107 million related to nonperforming counterparties.(c) Annualized.NM - Not meaningfulCommercial net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2001 were $148 million,compared with $63 million in the first quarter of 2000, primarily reflecting anincrease in charge-offs in North America.COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL: The domestic commercial and industrial portfolioincreased $1.2 billion from 2000 year-end, reflecting general business activity.Net charge-offs in the 2001 first quarter amounted to $114 million, comparedwith $36 million in the 2000 first quarter. Nonperforming domestic commercialand industrial loans were $877 million, an increase of $150 million from the2000 year-end. The foreign commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $35.3billion at March 31, 2001, a decrease of 5% from the 2000 year-end level.Nonperforming foreign commercial and industrial loans were $374 million, adecrease of $182 million from year-end 2000 due in large part to a continuingimprovement in the Asian loan portfolio. Net charge-offs in the foreigncommercial and industrial loan portfolio for the first quarter of 2001 increasedto $22 million, from $18 million in the same period last year.FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: Loans to financial institutions decreased $6.0 billionduring 2001, when compared with year-end, primarily in the domestic portion ofthe portfolio. Nonperforming financial institution loans increased from $42million to $281 million, primarily due to one borrower in the domesticportfolio. -33-  34Part IItem 2 (continued)DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized byJPMorgan Chase in connection with its trading and Assets/Liabilities ("A/L")activities, see Note 3 of this Form 10-Q, and page 50 and Notes 1 and 25 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at March 31,2001 and December 31, 2000.COUNTRY EXPOSUREThe following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries.Cross-border disclosure is based on an adjusted regulatory view (FFIEC 009) ofcountry exposure (see footnote (a) below). For a further discussion of theFirm's country exposure, see page 51 of the 2000 Annual Report.SELECTED COUNTRY EXPOSURE(a) Under the adjusted regulatory view of country exposure, resale agreements are reported by the country of the counterparty of the transactions (rather than the country of the issuer of the underlying security); short security positions can be used to offset long positions in a country; and credit derivatives are treated as trading positions and used to reduce or increase exposure within a country.(b) Lending-related includes loans and accrued interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit, resale agreements and undrawn commitments to extend credit (all adjusted for the impact of credit derivatives).(c) Trading-related includes cross-border trading debt and equity instruments adjusted for the impact of credit derivatives and the mark-to-market exposure of derivative and foreign exchange contracts. The amounts associated with derivative and foreign exchange contracts are presented after taking into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.(d) Local assets funded cross border are considered cross-border exposure.Cross-border exposure to Argentina on an adjusted regulatory view, increasedfrom $2.2 billion at December 31, 2000 to $2.4 billion at March 31, 2001.However, the internal management view of cross-border exposure to Argentina was$1.5 billion at March 31, 2001, up from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2000. -34-  35Part IItem 2 (continued)CONSUMER PORTFOLIO(a) Represents the portion of JPMorgan Chase's credit card receivables that have been securitized.(b) Consists of installment loans (direct and indirect types of consumer finance), student loans and unsecured lines of credit.(c) Annualized.(d) Includes foreign consumer.JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio is primarily domestic and is geographicallywell-diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled $120.2billion at March 31, 2001, an increase of $5.7 billion since year-end. Consumernet charge-offs, on a managed basis, were $540 million and $524 million for thefirst quarter of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase is primarily due toan increase in credit card net charge-offs.RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS: Residential mortgage loans were $54.1 billion atMarch 31, 2001, a $3.8 billion increase from year-end, while the level ofnonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased 6%. The net charge-off rateof 0.08% for the first quarter of 2001 was unchanged from first quarter 2000,reflecting the continued stable credit quality of this portfolio.CREDIT CARD LOANS: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a"managed basis," which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet aswell as credit card receivables that have been securitized. These amountsinclude domestic and international consumer and commercial credit card activity(for reporting purposes, commercial credit cards are reported within thecommercial loan category).Managed credit card receivables of $36.5 billion for the first quarter of 2001remained flat when compared with year-end 2000 but increased 13% from lastyear's first quarter. During the 2001 first quarter, net charge-offs as apercentage of average credit card receivables decreased to 5.05%, compared with5.44% in the prior-year period. Loans over 90 days past due increased to 1.99%of the portfolio at March 31, 2001, compared with 1.96% at December 31, 2000.Management anticipates that the managed credit card net charge-off ratio for thefull-year 2001 will be comparable to full-year 2000 although the amount of totalcharge-offs are expected to increase for 2001.AUTO FINANCINGS: Auto financings outstanding increased 8% at March 31, 2001,when compared with year-end 2000. Although increased from the prior year, thecharge-off rate of 0.56% for the 2001 first quarter continues to be indicativeof this portfolio's selective approach to asset origination. Total originationswere $4.3 billion for the three months of 2001, compared with $2.6 billion forthe same 2000 period. -35-  36Part IItem 2 (continued)OTHER CONSUMER LOANS: The level of other consumer loans of $8.1 billion at March31, 2001 remained comparable with year-end levels. The net charge-off ratesrelated to this portfolio were down in the first quarter when compared withthe first quarter of 2000.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESLoans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of March 31, 2001, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.Within the allowance, there are both specific and expected loss components and aresidual component. For a further discussion of the specific loss, expected lossand residual components of the allowance for loan losses, see page 53 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.March 31, 2001 versus March 31, 2000: The provision for loan losses increased$105 million or 31% when compared to the first quarter of 2000.Foreign commercial net loan charge-offs remained relatively stable during thefirst three months of 2001, when compared to the prior-year quarter, and foreigncommercial nonperforming loans decreased $365 million from March 31, 2000.However, domestic commercial net loan charge-offs and nonperforming loansincreased $84 million and $720 million, respectively, during the same periods.Lending-Related Commitments: JPMorgan Chase also has an allowance for itslending-related commitments, using a methodology similar to that for the loanportfolio. This allowance, which is reported in Other Liabilities, was $283million at March 31, 2001 and $296 million at March 31, 2000. -36-  37Part IItem 2 (continued)MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTAGGREGATE VAR EXPOSUREValue-at-risk ("VAR") is a measure of the dollar amount of potential loss fromadverse market moves in an everyday market environment. VAR calculations areperformed for all material trading and investment portfolios and for marketrisk-related A/L activities. Due to the complexity of the modeling andprocedural differences at the heritage firms, combined VAR is not available forperiods prior to the merger date. In addition, due to significant differences inthe definition of market risk-related revenues used in preparation of histogramsat Chase and J.P. Morgan, it is not feasible to include a histogram forfiscal-year 2000.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thetables that follow provide a meaningful overview of the market risk exposure ofJPMorgan Chase.The following table represents JPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs forits trading portfolios and its A/L activities.(a) Substantially all of the risk is interest rate related.NM - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect. In addition, JPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs are less than the sum of the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.MARKET RISK-RELATED ACTIVITIESValue-at-Risk: JPMorgan Chase is exposed to interest rate, foreign exchange,equity and commodity market risks in its trading portfolio. The table belowreflects VAR data for the trading portfolio by risk category. See Aggregate VARExposure section above for average and period-end VARs for the total tradingportfolio.MARKED-TO-MARKET TRADING PORTFOLIO (a)(a) While integrated VAR computations are available for the aggregate portfolio, integrated VAR by risk category has not yet been implemented. Accordingly, this table has been prepared using certain estimates and assumptions. The risk category VAR was computed based on the methodologies used by the heritage firms, assuming no correlation between the heritage firms' exposures. Actual risk category VAR may differ from these estimates.NM - Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect. In addition, JPMorgan Chase's average and period-end VARs are less than the sum of the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification. -37-  38Part IItem 2 (continued)HISTOGRAM:The following histogram illustrates JPMorgan Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income, brokeragecommissions, underwriting fees or other revenue. In first quarter 2001, JPMorganChase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 60 out of 62 days,with 46 days exceeding positive $25 million. Losses were sustained on only twoof the 62 days represented in the histogram. JPMorgan Chase incurred no dailytrading losses in excess of $15 million in the first quarter of 2001. [See Appendix 1 - Narrative Description of Graphic Image Material]Stress Testing: Whereas VAR captures exposure to unlikely events in normalmarkets, stress testing discloses market risk under plausible events in abnormalmarkets.The following table represents the potential stress test loss (pre-tax) inJPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase's stress testscenarios.LARGEST MONTHLY STRESS TEST LOSS - PRE-TAX -38-  39Part IItem 2 (continued)INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSET/LIABILITY ACTIVITIESJPMorgan Chase is also exposed to market risk in its investment portfolio andA/L activities. Market risk measurements for JPMorgan Chase's investmentportfolio and A/L activities do not take into account all factors that have aneffect on these activities, such as changes in credit quality.Value-at-Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section on page 37 for JPMorganChase's average and period-end VARs for its investment portfolio and marketrisk-related A/L activities.Stress Testing:Economic value stress testing measures the potential change in the market valueof JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities. As of March 31,2001, the potential impact of the economic value stress test scenario on thevalue of JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities would havebeen equivalent to less than 1% of JPMorgan Chase's market capitalization.The NII stress test measures the potential change in JPMorgan Chase's interestearnings over a one-year time horizon. At March 31, 2001, JPMorgan Chase'slargest potential NII stress test loss was estimated to be approximately 8.1% ofprojected net income for the full year 2001.Nonstatistical Risk Measures: Exposure to interest rate risk is assessed using aBasis Point Value ("BPV") method. BPV measures the change in market value ofJPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities to a one basis pointincrease in interest rates (directional risk) or one basis point widening ofinterest rate spreads (basis risk). The table that follows shows that JPMorganChase had a directional BPV of $(8.6) million (pre-tax) at March 31, 2001. Thisindicates that the market value of JPMorgan Chase's A/L positions would havedeclined by approximately $8.6 million for every one basis point increase ininterest rates along the interest rate yield curve. The table also shows thatthe economic value of JPMorgan Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activitieswould have declined by $(18.4) million (pre-tax) for every one basis pointwidening of interest rate spreads (basis risk).MARKET RISK-RELATED A/L ACTIVITIES -39-  40Part IItem 2 (continued)CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December 31, 2000 and should be read inconjunction with pages 44-45 and Note 23 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.CAPITALJPMorgan Chase's capital levels at March 31, 2001 continued to improve withratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. At March 31, 2001, the Tier 1and Total Capital ratios were 8.7% and 12.3%, respectively, and the Tier 1leverage ratio was 5.4%.The following table shows JPMorgan Chase's capital generation and use during theperiods indicated.In the first quarter of 2001, JPMorgan Chase raised the quarterly cash dividendon its common stock to $0.34 per share from $0.32 per share.At March 31, 2001, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (the sum of Tier 1and Tier 2 Capital) was $55.4 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion from December31, 2000. This increase reflects retained earnings (net income less common andpreferred dividends) generated during the period, treasury stock reissuances of$554 million and the issuance of $500 million in trust preferred capitalsecurities, partially offset by the redemption of preferred stock and capitalneeded for internal asset growth.LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk management focusesprimarily on the developments since December 31, 2000 and should be read inconjunction with page 59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.LIQUIDITYDuring the first three months of 2001, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $4.5billion of long-term debt and $500 million of trust preferred capitalsecurities. During the same period, $5 billion of long-term debt matured or wasredeemed. -40-  41Part IItem 2 (continued)OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer to page58 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2000 Form 10-K.DIVIDENDSJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries, without the approval of their relevantbanking regulators, could pay dividends to their respective bank holdingcompanies in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These dividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaledapproximately $3.8 billion at March 31, 2001.OTHER EVENTSOn February 21, 2001, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. acquired Colson Services Corp.("Colson"), a privately held record keeper and loan servicer. The Colsonbusiness will be managed as part of Institutional Trust Services within Treasury& Securities Services and will enhance the Firm's position as a leading providerof outsourcing support to government agencies.On February 28, 2001, Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, an indirectsubsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., completed the acquisition of the mortgagebusiness of Advanta Corp. The acquisition included Advanta's originationcapability, loan servicing and subservicing portfolio, and relatedsecuritization residual interests.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSADOPTION OF SFAS 140The Firm adopted the transfer provisions of SFAS 140 on April 1, 2001. Adoptionwill not have a significant impact on the Firm's financial statements.LEGAL ISOLATIONIn April 2001, the FASB announced its intention to issue a Technical Bulletinthat would delay the effective date of SFAS 140 for certain provisions thatimpact entities subject to possible receivership by the FDIC. For thoseentities, it is expected that the Technical Bulletin will delay the isolationstandards of SFAS 140 until transfers occurring after December 31, 2001. Untilthe Technical Bulletin is issued, the FASB has concluded it is appropriate forentities to continue to apply the previous isolation standard of SFAS 125. TheFirm is currently reviewing its transactions to determine what modificationswill be required to conform with SFAS 140. -41-  42Part IItem 2 (continued) J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO.
