>Table of ContentsReservable criticized balances, net charge-offs and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in the commercial credit portfolio declined in 2011. The reductions in reservable criticized and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property were primarily in the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Commercial real estate continued to show improvement during 2011&#32;compared to 2010&#32;in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. However, levels of &nbsp;stressed commercial real estate loans remain elevated. The reduction in reservable criticized U.S. commercial loans was driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients, industries and businesses. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolios also improved. Table 38&#32;presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010.Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were 2.02 percent&#32;and 3.32 percent&#32;(2.04 percent&#32;and 3.35 percent&#32;excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases were 0.10 percent&#32;and 0.21 percent&#32;(0.10 percent&#32;and 0.22 percent&#32;excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. Table 39&#32;presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our &nbsp;commercial loans and leases for 2011&#32;and 2010. Improving portfolio trends drove lower charge-offs and higher recoveries across most of the portfolio. Commercial real estate net charge-offs during 2011&#32;declined&#32;in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs declined&#32;primarily due to improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies. U.S. commercial charge-offs decreased&#32;during 2011&#32;due to broad-based declines from improvements in client profiles, industries and businesses.Table of ContentsTable 40&#32;presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs, financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which the Corporation is legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased&#32;$10.4 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to December&#160;31, 2010&#32;driven primarily by increases in loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in SBLCs, LHFS and bankers' acceptances. &nbsp;Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased&#32;$6.1 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;driven primarily by increases in loans and leases, partially offset by decreases in SBLCs, LHFS and bankers' acceptances. Utilized loans and leases increased primarily due to growth and higher revolver utilization in our international franchise, and were partially offset by run-off in the commercial real estate portfolio and the transfer of securities-based lending exposures from our U.S. commercial portfolio to the consumer portfolio during 2011. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, and bankers' acceptances was 57 percent&#32;at both December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010.Table 41&#32;presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;$15.4 billion, or 36 percent, in 2011&#32;due to broad-based decreases across most portfolios, primarily in commercial real estate and U.S. commercial &nbsp;driven largely by continued paydowns, sales and ratings upgrades outpacing downgrades. Despite the improvements, utilized reservable criticized levels remain elevated, particularly in commercial real estate and U.S. small business commercial. At December&#160;31, 2011, approximately 85 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured compared to 88 percent at December&#160;31, 2010.U.S. CommercialAt December&#160;31, 2011, 58 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global&#32;Commercial Banking and 30 percent in GBAM. The remaining 12 percent was mostly in GWIM&#32;(business-purpose loans for wealthy &nbsp;clients). U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased&#32;$4.4 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;due to continued growth and higher revolver utilization across the portfolio. This increase was net of a product reclassification for certain trade loans to non-U.S. commercial in 2011, as well as Table of Contentsthe transfer of securities-based lending loans to the consumer portfolio earlier in 2011, which together totaled $5.3 billion. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans and leases declined&#32;$5.5 billion&#32;and $1.3 billion&#32;in 2011. The declines were broad-based in terms of clients and industries and were driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs decreased&#32;$686 million&#32;in 2011&#32;due to broad-based declines from credit quality improvements mentioned above, driving lower charge-offs and higher recoveries.Commercial Real EstateThe commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Commercial Banking&#32;and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, homebuilders and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased&#32;$9.8 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;due to paydowns and sales, which outpaced new originations and renewals. Over 90 percent of this decrease occurred within reservable criticized.The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration of commercial real estate loans and leases at 20 percent&#32;and 18 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. For more information on geographic and property concentrations, see &nbsp;Table 42.Credit quality for commercial real estate continued to show signs of improvement; however, we expect that elevated unemployment and ongoing pressure on vacancy and rental rates will continue to affect primarily the non-homebuilder portfolio. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased&#32;31 percent&#32;in 2011, split evenly across the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolios. The decline in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-homebuilder portfolio was driven by decreases in the shopping centers/retail, land and land development, and office property types. Reservable criticized balances decreased&#32;$9.0 billion&#32;primarily due to declines in the office, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types in the non-homebuilder portfolio and improvement in the homebuilder portfolio. Net charge-offs declined&#32;$1.1 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;due to improvement in both the homebuilder and non-homebuilder portfolio.Table 42&#32;presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region which is based on the geographic location of the collateral and property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate which is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.During 2011, we continued to see improvement in the homebuilder portfolio. Certain portions of the non-homebuilder portfolio remain at risk as occupancy rates, rental rates and commercial property prices remain under pressure. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized &nbsp;and potential exposure in the commercial real estate portfolios including refinement of our credit standards, additional transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of alternative resolution methods to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Table of ContentsTables 43&#32;and 44&#32;present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-homebuilder and homebuilder property types. The homebuilder portfolio presented in Tables 42, 43&#32;and 44&#32;includes condominiums and other residential real estate. Other property &nbsp;types in Tables 42, 43&#32;and 44&#32;primarily include special purpose, nursing/retirement homes, medical facilities and restaurants, as well as unsecured loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate.At December&#160;31, 2011, total committed non-homebuilder exposure was $53.1 billion compared to $64.2 billion at December&#160;31, 2010, with the decrease due to exposure reductions in all non-homebuilder property types. Non-homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were $3.5 billion&#32;and $4.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, which represented 9.29 percent and 10.08 percent of total non-homebuilder loans and foreclosed properties. Non-homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;to $10.1 billion, or 25.34 percent of non-homebuilder utilized reservable exposure, at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to $17.1 billion, or 35.55 percent, at December&#160;31, 2010. The decrease in reservable criticized exposure was driven primarily by office, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types. For the non-homebuilder portfolio, net charge-offs decreased&#32;$862 million&#32;in 2011&#32;due in part to resolution of criticized assets through payoffs and sales.&nbsp;At December&#160;31, 2011, we had committed homebuilder exposure of $3.9 billion compared to $6.0 billion at December&#160;31, 2010, of which $2.4 billion and $4.3 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in homebuilder committed exposure was due to repayments, net charge-offs, reductions in new home construction and continued risk mitigation initiatives with market conditions providing fewer origination opportunities to offset the reductions. Homebuilder nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased&#32;$970 million&#32;due to repayments, a decline in the volume of loans being downgraded to nonaccrual status and net charge-offs. Homebuilder utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;$2.0 billion&#32;to $1.4 billion&#32;due to repayments and net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the homebuilder portfolio were 38.89 percent and 54.65 percent at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to 42.80 percent and 74.27 percent at December&#160;31, 2010. Net charge-offs for the homebuilder portfolio decreased&#32;$208 million&#32;in 2011.Table of ContentsAt December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $10.9 billion and $19.1 billion of construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. The decline in construction and land development loans was driven by repayments, net charge-offs and continued risk mitigation initiatives which outpaced new originations. This portfolio is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographic regions but faces continuing challenges in the housing and rental markets. Weak rental demand and cash flows along with depressed property valuations of land have contributed to elevated levels of reservable criticized exposure, nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties,&#32;and net charge-offs. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $4.9 billion and $10.5 billion, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $2.1 billion and $4.0 billion at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. Loans continue to be classified as construction loans until they are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve.Non-U.S. CommercialThe non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio is managed primarily in GBAM. Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased&#32;$23.4 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;from continued growth in corporate loans and trade finance due to client demand, enterprise-wide initiatives, regional economic conditions and disruption in debt and equity markets, along with the product reclassification from U.S. commercial in 2011. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio&#32;on page 104.&nbsp;U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of business card and small business loans managed in Card Services&#32;and Global Commercial Banking. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs declined&#32;$923 million&#32;in 2011&#32;driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies resulting from an improved economic environment as well as the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 74 percent were credit card-related products for 2011&#32;compared to 79 percent for 2010.Commercial Loans Carried at Fair ValueThe portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in GBAM. Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option increased&#32;$3.3 billion&#32;to an aggregate fair value of $6.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;due primarily to increased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $174 million resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio during 2011&#32;compared to net gains of $82 million&#32;in 2010. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $1.2 billion&#32;and $866 million&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010&#32;which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $25.7 billion&#32;and $27.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. During 2011&#32;we recorded net losses of $429 million&#32;from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit compared to net gains of $23 million&#32;in 2010. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.Table of ContentsNonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 45&#32;presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2011&#32;and 2010. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased&#32;$3.5 billion&#32;during 2011&#32;to $6.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;driven by paydowns, charge-offs, returns to performing status and sales, partially offset by new nonaccrual loans in the commercial real &nbsp;estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Approximately 96 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 51 percent are contractually current. In addition, commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 68 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less estimated costs to sell.As a result of the retrospective application of new accounting guidance on TDRs effective September 30, 2011, the Corporation classified $1.1 billion&#32;of commercial loan modifications as TDRs that in previous periods had not been classified as TDRs. These loans were newly identified as TDRs typically because the Corporation was not able to demonstrate that the modified rate of interest, although significantly higher than the rate prior to &nbsp;modification, was a market rate of interest. These newly identified TDRs did not have a significant impact on the allowance for credit losses or the provision for credit losses. Included in this amount was $402 million&#32;of performing commercial loans at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;that were not previously considered to be impaired loans. For additional information, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table of ContentsTable 46&#32;presents our commercial TDRs by product type and status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.Industry ConcentrationsTable 47&#32;presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. The increase&#32;in commercial committed exposure of $10.4 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;was concentrated in banks, diversified financials and energy, partially offset by lower real estate, insurance (including monolines) and other committed exposure. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management's Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance.Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an increase&#32;in committed exposure of $8.2 billion, or nine percent, in 2011&#32;driven primarily by increases in consumer finance lending and traded products exposure. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced a decrease&#32;in committed exposure of $9.4 billion, or 13 percent, in 2011&#32;due primarily to paydowns and sales which outpaced new originations and renewals. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 20 percent and 27 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Real Estate&#32;on page 97.Committed exposure in the banking industry increased $9.1 billion, or 31 percent, in 2011&#32;primarily due to increases in trade finance as a result of momentum from regional economies and growth initiatives in foreign markets. Energy committed exposure increased $5.7 billion, or 22 percent, in 2011&#32;due to increases in working capital lines for state-related enterprises and increases in large investment-grade energy companies.Insurance, including monolines committed exposure, decreased&#32;$8.3 billion, or 34 percent, in 2011&#32;due primarily to the settlement/termination of monoline positions. For more information on our monoline exposure, see Monoline and Related Exposure&#32;below. Other committed exposure decreased&#32;$6.0 billion, or 44 &nbsp;percent, in 2011&#32;due to reductions primarily in traded products exposure. The Corporation's committed state and municipal exposure of $46.1 billion at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;consisted of $34.4 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $18.6 billion of funded loans, $11.3 billion of SBLCs and $4.1 billion of derivative assets) and unutilized commercial exposure of $11.7 billion (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the Government and public education industry in Table 47. Economic conditions continue to impact debt issued by state and local municipalities and certain exposures to these municipalities. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications surrounding certain at-risk counterparties and/or sectors are regularly circulated ensuring exposure levels are in compliance with established concentration guidelines.Monoline and Related ExposureMonoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits.We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities.We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor's loss. For additional information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations &#8211; Representations and Warranties&#32;on page 56&#32;and Note 9 &#8211; Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table of ContentsDuring 2011, we terminated all of our monoline contracts referencing super senior ABS CDOs and reclassified net monoline exposure with a carrying value of $1.3 billion&#32;($4.7 billion&#32;gross receivable less impairment) at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;from derivative assets to other assets because of the inherent default risk. Because these contracts no longer provide a hedge benefit, they are no longer considered derivative trading instruments. This exposure relates to a single counterparty and is recorded at fair value based on current net recovery projections. The net recovery projections take into account the present value of projected payments expected to be received from the counterparty.Monoline derivative credit exposure had a notional value of $21.1 billion&#32;and $38.4 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $1.8 billion&#32;and $9.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010&#32;with the decrease driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets, terminated monoline contracts and the reclassification of net monoline exposure to other assets mentioned above. The counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to monoline derivative exposure was $417 million&#32;and $5.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. This adjustment reduced our net &nbsp;mark-to-market exposure to $1.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to $3.9 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2010&#32;and covered 24 percent&#32;of the mark-to-market exposure at December&#160;31, 2011, down from 57 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2010. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. For more information on our monoline exposure, termination of certain monoline contracts and the transfer of monoline exposure to other assets, see GBAM&#32;on page 49.We also have indirect exposure to monolines as we invest in securities where the issuers have purchased wraps. For example, municipalities and corporations purchase insurance in order to reduce their cost of borrowing. If the rating agencies downgrade the monolines, the credit rating of the bond may fall and may have an adverse impact on the market value of the security. In the case of default, we first look to the underlying securities and then to the purchased insurance for recovery. Investments in securities with purchased wraps issued by municipalities and corporations had a notional amount of $150 million and $2.4 billion at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. Mark-to-market investment exposure was $89 million at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to $2.2 billion at December&#160;31, 2010.Table of ContentsRisk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $19.4 billion&#32;and $20.1 billion. The mark-to-market effects, including the cost of net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure, resulted in net gains of $121 million in 2011&#32;compared to net losses of $546 million in 2010.&nbsp;The average VaR for these credit derivative hedges was $60 million in 2011&#32;compared to $53 million in 2010. The average VaR for the related credit exposure was $74 million in 2011&#32;compared to $65 million in 2010. There is a diversification effect between the net credit default protection hedging our credit exposure and the related credit exposure such that the combined average VaR was $38 million in 2011&#32;compared to $41 million in 2010. See Trading Risk Management&#32;on page 113&#32;for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio. Tables 48&#32;and 49&#32;present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. The distribution of debt ratings for net notional credit default protection purchased is shown as a negative amount.In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a &nbsp;credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.Table 50&#32;presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. For information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 4 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table of ContentsThe credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 50&#32;take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, while amounts disclosed in Note 4 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;are shown &nbsp;on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.n/a = not applicableCounterparty Credit Risk Valuation AdjustmentsWe record a counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. These adjustments are necessary as the market quotes on derivatives do not fully reflect the credit risk of the counterparties to the derivative assets. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment. All or a portion of these counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments are subsequently adjusted due to changes in the value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty.During 2011&#32;and 2010, credit valuation gains (losses) of $(1.9) billion&#32;and $731 million&#32;($(606) million&#32;and $(8) million, net of hedges) for counterparty credit risk were recognized in trading account profits for counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets. For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see GBAM&#32;&#8211;&#32;Collateralized Debt Obligation and Monoline Exposure&#32;on page 51&#32;and Monoline and Related Exposure&#32;on page 101.Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S.&#160;risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Regional Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC.&nbsp;Table 51&#32;sets forth total non-U.S. exposure broken out by region at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010. Non-U.S. exposure includes credit exposure net of local liabilities, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.&#160;Total non-U.S.&#160;exposure can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Resale agreements are generally presented based on the domicile of the counterparty consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements.Table of ContentsOur total non-U.S. exposure was $232.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011, a decrease&#32;of $29.4 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2010. Our non-U.S. exposure remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for $115.9 billion, or 50 percent, of total non-U.S. exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. The decrease&#32;of $32.2 billion&#32;in Europe was primarily driven by our efforts to reduce risk in countries affected by the ongoing debt crisis in the Eurozone. Select European countries are further detailed in Table 54. Asia Pacific was our second largest non-U.S. exposure at $74.6 billion, or 32 percent. The $1.3 billion&#32;increase&#32;in Asia Pacific was driven by increases in securities and local exposure in Japan and increases in the emerging markets, predominately in local exposure, loans and securities offset by the sale of CCB shares. For more information on our CCB investment, see Note 5 &#8211; Securities&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Latin America accounted for $17.4 billion, or seven percent, of total non-U.S.&#160;exposure. The $2.6 billion&#32;increase&#32;in Latin America was primarily driven by an increase in Brazil in securities and local country exposure. Middle East and Africa increased&#32;$926 million&#32;to $4.6 billion, representing two percent&#32;of total non-U.S. exposure. Other non-U.S. exposure was $20.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011, &nbsp;a decrease&#32;of $2.1 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;resulting primarily from a decrease in local exposure as a result of the sale of our Canadian consumer card business. For more information on our Asia Pacific and Latin America exposure, see non-U.S. exposure to selected countries defined as emerging markets on page 106.Table 52&#32;presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December&#160;31, 2011, the United Kingdom and Japan were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December&#160;31, 2011, Canada and France had total cross-border exposure of $16.9 billion&#32;and $16.1 billion&#32;representing 0.79 percent&#32;and 0.75 percent&#32;of total assets. Canada and France were the only other countries that had total cross-border exposure that exceeded 0.75 percent&#32;of our total assets at December&#160;31, 2011.Exposure includes cross-border claims by our non-U.S.&#160;offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unused commitments, SBLCs, commercial letters of credit and formal guarantees. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report.Table of ContentsAs presented in Table 53, non-U.S. exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets decreased&#32;$3.4 billion&#32;to $61.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011. The decrease&#32;was due to the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by growth in the rest of &nbsp;Asia Pacific and other regions. Non-U.S.&#160;exposure to borrowers or counterparties in emerging markets represented 26 percent&#32;and 25 percent&#32;of total non-U.S.&#160;exposure at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010.Table of ContentsAt December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, 60 percent&#32;and 70 percent&#32;of our emerging markets exposure was in Asia Pacific. Emerging markets exposure in Asia Pacific decreased&#32;by $8.5 billion&#32;driven by a $19.0 billion&#32;decrease related to the sale of CCB shares, partially offset by increases in loans and securities predominately in India, China (excluding CCB) and South Korea. At December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, 26 percent&#32;and 21 percent&#32;of our emerging markets exposure was in Latin America. Latin America emerging markets exposure increased&#32;$2.5 billion&#32;driven by increases in securities and local exposure in Brazil. At December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, eight percent&#32;and six percent&#32;of our emerging markets exposure was in Middle East and Africa, with an increase&#32;of $926 million&#32;primarily driven by increases in loans and derivatives in United Arab Emirates, and by increases in loans in Other Middle East and Africa. At December&#160;31, 2011&#32;and 2010, six percent&#32;and three percent&#32;of the emerging markets exposure was in Central and Eastern Europe, with the increase driven by an increase in loans in the Russian Federation.Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress. Risks from the continued debt crisis in Europe could continue to disrupt the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Uncertainty in the progress of debt restructuring negotiations and the lack of a clear resolution to the crisis have led to continued volatility in European financial markets, as well as global financial markets. In December 2011, the ECB announced initiatives to address European bank liquidity and funding concerns by providing low-cost, three-year loans to banks, and expanding collateral eligibility. In early 2012, S&P, Fitch and Moody's downgraded the credit ratings of several European countries, and S&P downgraded the credit rating of the EFSF, adding to concerns about investor appetite for continued support in stabilizing the affected countries. Table 54&#32;shows our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, excluding consumer credit card exposure, in these countries at December&#160;31, 2011. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was $15.3 billion&#32;at December 31, 2011 compared to $16.6 billion at December 31, 2010. The total exposure to these countries, net of hedges, was &nbsp;$10.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to $12.4 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2010, of which $252 million&#32;and $91 million&#32;was total sovereign exposure. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of net credit default protection purchased was $4.9 billion&#32;and $4.2 billion.We hedge certain of our selected European country exposure with credit default protection in the form of CDS. The majority of our CDS contracts are with highly-rated financial institutions primarily outside of the Eurozone and we work to limit or eliminate correlated CDS. Due to our engagement in market-making activities, our CDS portfolio contains contracts with various maturities to a diverse set of counterparties. In addition to our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, a significant deterioration of the European debt crisis could result in material reductions in the value of sovereign debt and other asset classes, disruptions in capital markets, widening of credit spreads, loss of investor confidence in the financial services industry, a slowdown in global economic activity and other adverse developments. For additional information on the debt crisis in Europe, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.Losses could still result even if there is credit default protection purchased because the purchased credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios and thus not all losses may be covered by the credit protection contracts. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of these risks is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. Generally, only the occurrence of a credit event as defined by the CDS terms (which may include, among other events, the failure to pay by, or restructuring of, the reference entity) results in a payment under the purchased credit protection contracts. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Determination Committee (comprised of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and facts and circumstances for the event. Accordingly, uncertainties exist as to whether any particular strategy or policy action for addressing European debt crisis would constitute a credit event under the CDS. A voluntary restructuring may not trigger a credit event under CDS terms and consequently may not trigger a payment under the CDS contract.Table of ContentsProvision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased&#32;$15.0 billion&#32;to $13.4 billion&#32;for 2011&#32;compared to 2010. The provision for credit losses was $7.4&#160;billion lower than net charge-offs for 2011, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses driven primarily by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the Card Services&#32;portfolio, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a $5.9 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2010. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $11.1&#160;billion to $14.3&#160;billion for 2011&#32;compared to 2010&#32;reflecting improving economic conditions and improvement in the current and projected levels of delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the U.S. consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. Also contributing to the decrease &nbsp;were lower credit costs in the non-PCI home equity loan portfolio due to improving portfolio trends, partially offset by higher credit costs in the residential mortgage portfolio primarily reflecting further deterioration in home prices. For the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves of $2.2 billion in 2011&#32;due primarily to our updated home price outlook. Reserve increases related to the consumer PCI loan portfolios in 2010 were also $2.2 billion.The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including the provision for unfunded lending commitments, decreased $3.9&#160;billion to a benefit of $915&#160;million in 2011&#32;compared to 2010&#32;due to continued economic improvement and the resulting impact on property values in the commercial real estate portfolio, lower current and projected levels of delinquencies and bankruptcies in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio and improvement in borrower credit profiles across the remainder of the commercial portfolio.Table of ContentsAllowance for Credit LossesAllowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components, as described below. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers nonperforming commercial loans and performing commercial loans that have been modified in a TDR, consumer real estate loans that have been modified in a TDR, renegotiated credit card, and renegotiated unsecured consumer and small business loans. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring and prior to any risk-based or penalty-based increase in rate on the restructured loans. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses but are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December&#160;31, 2011, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for most consumer portfolios, particularly the credit card and direct/indirect portfolios.The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios are updated at least &nbsp;quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. When estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, management relies not only on models derived from historical experience but also on its judgment in considering the effect on probable losses inherent in the portfolios due to the current macroeconomic environment and trends, inherent uncertainty in models and other qualitative factors. As of December&#160;31, 2011, updates to the loan risk ratings and portfolio composition resulted in reductions in the allowance for all commercial portfolios.Also included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves that are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty, large single name defaults, significant events which could disrupt financial markets and model imprecision. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in Table 56&#32;was $29.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011, a decrease&#32;of $5.1 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2010. This decrease&#32;was primarily due to improving economic conditions and improvement in the current and projected levels of delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in the U.S. consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios. With respect to the consumer PCI loan portfolios, updates to our expected cash flows resulted in an increase in reserves through provision of $2.2 billion in 2011, within the discontinued real estate, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios, primarily due to our updated home price outlook. Reserve increases related to the consumer PCI loan portfolios in 2010&#32;were also $2.2 billion.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio was $4.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011, a $3.0 billion&#32;decrease&#32;from December&#160;31, 2010. The decrease&#32;was driven by improvement in the economy and the resulting impact on property values in the commercial real estate portfolio, improvement in projected delinquencies in the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, mostly within Card Services, and stronger borrower credit profiles in the U.S. commercial portfolios, primarily in Global Commercial Banking&#32;and GBAM.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 3.68 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to 4.47 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2010. The decrease&#32;in the ratio was largely due to improved credit quality and economic conditions which led to the reduction in the Table of Contentsallowance for credit losses discussed above. The December 31, 2011 and 2010&#32;ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 2.86 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to 3.94 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2010.Absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, we expect &nbsp;reductions in the allowance for loan and lease losses to continue in 2012. However, in both consumer and commercial portfolios, we expect these reductions to be less than those in 2011&#32;and 2010.Table 55&#32;presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for 2011&#32;and 2010.Table of ContentsFor reporting purposes, we allocate the allowance for credit losses across products. However, the allowance is available to absorb any credit losses without restriction. Table 56&#32;presents our allocation by product type.Table of ContentsReserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;was $714 million, $474 million&#32;lower&#32;than December&#160;31, 2010&#32;driven by accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded positions and improved credit quality in the unfunded portfolio.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation.Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 22 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer, credit and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques.&nbsp;Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S.&#160;subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S.&#160;interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.Mortgage RiskMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;and Note 25 &#8211; Mortgage Servicing Rights&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards and foreign currency-denominated debt.Equity Market RiskEquity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.Table of ContentsCommodity RiskCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.Issuer Credit RiskIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.Market Liquidity RiskMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.&nbsp;Trading Risk ManagementTrading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 22 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment.The Global Markets Risk Committee (GRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance authority for global markets risk management including trading risk management. The GRC's focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting GBAM&#32;and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact businesses outside of GBAM&#32;are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities.The GRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses. Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is provided to the GRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility.Table of ContentsThe histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2011&#32;and 2010. During 2011, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 86&#160;percent (214 days) of the trading days of which 66&#160;percent (165 days) were daily trading gains of over $25&#160;million, five percent (12 days) of the trading days had losses greater than &nbsp;$25&#160;million and the largest loss was $119&#160;million. This is compared to 2010, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 90&#160;percent (225 days) of the trading days of which 75&#160;percent (187 days) were daily trading gains of over $25&#160;million, four percent (nine days) of the trading days had losses greater than $25&#160;million and the largest loss was $102&#160;million.To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All limit excesses are communicated to management for review.A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence and depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available.&nbsp;A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are, however, many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. Our VaR model utilizes three years of historical data. This time period was chosen to ensure that the VaR reflects both a broad range of market movements as well as being sensitive to recent changes in market volatility.We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Nevertheless, due to the limitations previously discussed, we have historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees.Table of ContentsThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting, which involves comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data, the VaR results against the daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. In periods of market stress, the GRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure.&nbsp;Our VaR model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. The number of actual backtesting excesses observed is dependent on current market performance relative to historic market volatility. For most of 2011, the three years of historical market data utilized for VaR included the volatile fourth quarter of 2008. Subsequent market volatility has generally been lower, and as a result, the size of the largest trading losses experienced since then has been lower than would be expected based on the VaR measure. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR in 2011&#32;or 2010. The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for 2011.Table 57&#32;presents average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2011&#32;and 2010.The $35 million&#32;decrease in average VaR during 2011&#32;was primarily due to a reduction in risk during the year. This was driven primarily by a decrease in credit exposures where average VaR decreased $62 million&#32;compared to 2010. In addition, for 2010&#32;&nbsp;and 2011, data from the more volatile periods of 2007 and 2008 were no longer included in our three-year historical dataset. These impacts were partially offset by a reduction in portfolio diversification VaR of $37 million.Table of ContentsCounterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting.Trading Portfolio Stress TestingBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates, and is dependent on a limited lookback window, we also &#8220;stress test&#8221; our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from pre-defined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page 76.Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading ActivitiesInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of core net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The core net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing &nbsp;assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics, but do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. The prepayment impact on amortization is reflected in the period in which a prepayment is forecasted to occur. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income and capital.Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they provide a comprehensive view of the Corporation's interest rate risk exposure and are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. Given the low level of short-end rates, we have determined that gradual downward shifts of 50 bps applied to the short-end of the market-based forward curve provide a more realistic view of potential exposure resulting from changes in interest rates. This replaced the 100 bps downward shift scenarios applied to the short-end of the market-based forward curve previously presented. In addition, a long-end flattener of (50)&#160;bps was added for comparability purposes.The spot and 12-month forward monthly rates used in our baseline forecast at December 31, 2011 and 2010&#32;are presented in Table 58.Table 59&#32;shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income over the next twelve months from December 31, 2011 and 2010, resulting from a gradual parallel increase and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. For further discussion of core net interest income, see page&#160;39.Table of ContentsThe sensitivity analysis in Table 59&#32;assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated periods. Our core net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The significant decline in long-end rates contributed to the increase in asset sensitivity between 2011&#32;and 2010.SecuritiesThe securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM position and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S.&#160;Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we held AFS debt securities of $276.2 billion&#32;and $337.6 billion. During 2011&#32;and 2010, we purchased AFS debt securities of $99.5 billion&#32;and $199.2 billion, sold $116.8 billion&#32;and $97.5 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $56.7 billion&#32;and $70.9 billion. We realized $3.4 billion&#32;and $2.5 billion&#32;in net gains on sales of debt securities during 2011&#32;and 2010. We securitized no mortgage loans into MBS during 2011&#32;compared to $2.4 billion&#32;in 2010, which we retained.During 2011, we purchased approximately $35.6 billion&#32;of U.S. agency MBS which are classified as held-to-maturity securities. The purchases of these securities are part of our long-term investment activities which include holding these securities to maturity. The classification of these securities as held-to-maturity also mitigates accumulated OCI volatility and possible negative impacts on our regulatory capital requirements under the Basel III capital standards. The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity securities are greater than 10 years and they are subject to prepayment by the issuers.Accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of $3.1 billion&#32;and $7.4 billion&#32;at December 31, 2011 and 2010, comprised primarily of after-tax net unrealized gains of $3.1 billion&#32;and $714 million&#32;related to AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized gains of $3 million&#32;and $6.7 billion&#32;related to AFS marketable equity securities. The December&#160;31, 2010&#32;unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was related to our investment in CCB. See Note 5 &#8211; Securities&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for further discussion on marketable equity securities. The net unrealized gains in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities increased $3.9 billion&#32;during 2011&#32;to $5.0 billion, primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. We recognized $299 million&#32;of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in 2011&#32;compared to $970 million on AFS debt and marketable equity securities in 2010. The recognition of OTTI losses on AFS debt and marketable equity securities is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.Residential Mortgage PortfolioAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, our residential mortgage portfolio was $262.3 billion&#32;(which excludes $906 million&#32;in &nbsp;residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option) and $258.0 billion. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Credit Risk &#8211; Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option&#32;on page 92. Outstanding residential mortgage loans increased&#32;$4.3 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;as new origination volume was partially offset by paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties. In addition, we repurchased $7.8 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA which also increased the residential mortgage portfolio during 2011.During 2011&#32;and 2010, we retained $45.5&#160;billion and $63.8&#160;billion in first-lien mortgages originated by CRES&#32;and GWIM. We received paydowns of $42.3&#160;billion and $38.2&#160;billion in 2011&#32;and 2010. There were no loans securitized in 2011&#32;compared to $2.4 billion&#32;of loans securitized into MBS which we retained in 2010. We recognized gains of $68 million on the securitizations completed in 2010. We purchased $72 million of residential mortgages related to ALM activities in 2011&#32;compared to none in 2010. We sold $109&#160;million and $443 million of residential mortgages in 2011&#32;and 2010, of which all of the 2011&#32;sales were originated residential mortgages and $432&#160;million of the 2010&#32;sales were originated residential mortgages and $11 million were previously purchased from third parties. Net gains on these transactions were minimal.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see Note 4 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2011&#32;reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. Table 60&#32;includes derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our interest rate swap positions, including foreign exchange contracts, were a net receive-fixed position of $67.9 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps was $262.4 billion&#32;and $235.2 billion&#32;at December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our futures and forwards notional position, which reflects the net of long and short positions, was a long position of $12.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to a short position of $280 million&#32;at Table of ContentsDecember&#160;31, 2010. These changes in notional amounts are the result of ongoing interest rate and currency risk management positioning.The fair value of net ALM contracts decreased&#32;$7.9 billion&#32;to a gain&#32;of $4.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to $12.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2010. The decrease&#32;was primarily &nbsp;attributable to changes in the value of U.S.&#160;dollar-denominated pay-fixed interest rate swaps of $9.7 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $1.8 billion&#32;and foreign exchange basis swaps of $1.4 billion. The decrease was partially offset by a gain from the changes in the value of U.S. dollar-denominated receive-fixed interest rate swaps of $6.6 billion.Table of ContentsWe use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were $3.8 billion&#32;and $3.2 billion&#32;at December 31, 2011 and 2010. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December&#160;31, 2011, the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.5 billion, or 26 percent within the next year, 55 percent in years two through five, and 12 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 4 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax gains on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by losses on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December&#160;31, 2011.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used as economic hedges of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $14.7&#160;billion and $129.0&#160;billion.MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, Eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, as well as mortgage-backed and U.S.&#160;Treasury securities as economic hedges of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative contracts and other securities designated as economic hedges of MSRs were $2.6 trillion and $46.3 billion at &nbsp;December&#160;31, 2011&#32;compared to $1.6 trillion and $60.3 billion at December&#160;31, 2010. In 2011, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $6.3 billion related to the change in fair value of these economic hedges compared to $5.0 billion for 2010. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 25 &#8211; Mortgage Servicing Rights&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;and for more information on mortgage banking income, see CRES&#32;on page 43.Compliance Risk ManagementCompliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to laws, rules, regulations, and internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk can expose the Corporation to reputational risks as well as fines, civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations. Compliance is at the core of the Corporation's culture and is a key component of risk management discipline. The Global Compliance organization is responsible for driving a culture of compliance, establishing compliance program standards and policies; executing, monitoring and testing of business controls; performing risk assessments on the businesses' adherence to laws, rules and standards as well as effectiveness of business controls; delivering compliance risk reporting; and ensuring the identification, escalation, and timely mitigation of emerging and existing compliance risks. Global Compliance is also responsible for facilitating processes to effectively manage and influence the dynamic regulatory environment and build constructive relationships with regulators.The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee.Operational Risk ManagementThe Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions, and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in Basel II which require that the Corporation has internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures.Under the Basel&#160;II Rules, an operational loss event is an event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters.Under our Operational Risk Management Program, we approach operational risk management from two perspectives to best manage operational risk within the structure of the Corporation: (1)&#160;at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2)&#160;at Table of Contentsthe business and enterprise control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation's Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation's overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the Operational Risk Committee (ORC) oversees and approves the Corporation's policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The ORC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The ORC reports operational risk activities to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board.Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to the businesses, enterprise control functions, senior management, governance committees and the Board.The business and enterprise control functions are responsible for all the risks within the business line, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and RCSAs, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices, data reconciliation processes, fraud management units, transaction processing monitoring and analysis, business recovery planning and new product introduction processes. The business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices. Business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise risk and control self-assessment process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goal of this process is to assess changing market and business conditions, to evaluate key risks impacting each business and enterprise control function and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. The risk and control self-assessment process is documented at periodic intervals. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on an enterprise, business and enterprise control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation's overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Validation Team.The enterprise control functions participate in the operational risk management process in two ways. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services (e.g., information management, vendor management) within their area of expertise to the enterprise and the businesses and other enterprise control functions they support. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each business and enterprise control function relative to these programs.Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses when and if they occur. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As &nbsp;insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;are essential in understanding the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that, with the exception of accrued taxes, involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are home loans, credit card and other consumer, and commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio's inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers' or counterparties' ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions.Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for Table of Contentsconsumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions.Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our home loans, and credit card and other consumer portfolio segments. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our home loans portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;would have increased by $156&#160;million. PCI loans within our home loans portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $241&#160;million impairment of the portfolio, of which $115&#160;million would be related to our discontinued real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our credit card and other consumer portfolio segment coupled with a one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;would have increased by $84&#160;million.Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within our commercial portfolio segment. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $3.1&#160;billion at December&#160;31, 2011.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;was 3.68 percent&#32;and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 4.00&#160;percent.These sensitivity analyses do not represent management's expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote.The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions.Mortgage Servicing RightsMSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income. Commercial-related and residential reverse mortgage &nbsp;MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method, lower of amortized cost or fair value, with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income. At December&#160;31, 2011, our total MSR balance was $7.5 billion.We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread levels. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10&#160;percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of $639 million&#32;in MSRs and mortgage banking income at December&#160;31, 2011. This impact does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management&#32;on page&#160;119.For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see Note 25 &#8211; Mortgage Servicing Rights&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and marketable equity securities, certain MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain corporate loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 22 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;and Note 23 &#8211; Fair Value Option&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The fair values of assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be Table of Contentsmore variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business.Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the rating agencies.Trading account profits, which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use &nbsp;trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VaR, see Trading Risk Management&#32;on page&#160;113.The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for our own credit risk. The credit adjustments are determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available, a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market implied experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations.Level 3 Assets and LiabilitiesFinancial assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include consumer MSRs, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts and private equity investments, as well as certain loans, MBS, ABS, structured liabilities and CDOs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.Table of ContentsDuring 2011, we recognized net gains of $451 million&#32;on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains during the year were primarily in trading account profits combined with gains on IRLCs, partially offset by losses on MSRs. There were net unrealized gains of $19 million&#32;in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities at December&#160;31, 2011.Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be economically hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources.We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For additional information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2011, see Note 22 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Global Principal InvestmentsGPI is included within Equity Investments in All Other&#32;on page&#160;54. GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in both privately-held and publicly-traded companies. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. At December&#160;31, 2011, this portfolio totaled $5.6 billion&#32;including $4.3&#160;billion of non-public investments.Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes &nbsp;in fair value reported in equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our proportionate interest in the fund's capital as reported by the fund's respective managers.Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax AssetsAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance,&#32;in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period.Table of ContentsNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized.While we have established some valuation allowances for certain state and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, we have concluded that our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction will be sufficient to realize all U.S. federal and U.K. deferred tax assets, including NOL and tax credit carryforwards, that are not subject to any special limitations (such as change-in-control limitations) prior to any expiration. Significant decreases to our estimate of future taxable income by jurisdiction could materially change our conclusions about how much of our tax attributes and other deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized prior to their expiration. See Note 21 &#8211; Income Taxes&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsBackgroundThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;and Note 10 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is performed as of June&#160;30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill.We use the reporting units' allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying amount of equity for each reporting unit in our goodwill impairment tests as we do not maintain a record of equity as defined under GAAP at the reporting unit level. Allocated equity includes economic capital, goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets allocated to the reporting units. The allocation of economic capital to the reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing has the same basis as the allocation of economic capital to our operating segments. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporation's financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Allocated equity is updated on a quarterly basis.The Corporation's common stock price remained volatile during 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the continued uncertainty in the economy and in the financial services industry, as well as adverse developments related to our mortgage business and increased regulation. During these periods, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. We estimate that the fair value of all reporting units in aggregate as of the June&#160;30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test was $210.2 billion and the &nbsp;common stock market capitalization of the Corporation as of that date was $111.1 billion&#32;($58.6 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011). As none of our reporting units are publicly-traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly correlate to the Corporation's stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that recent fluctuations in our market capitalization reflect the fair value of our individual reporting units.Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach, and included the use of independent valuation specialists.The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, a control premium was added to arrive at the reporting units' estimated fair values on a controlling basis.For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of the reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results.International Consumer Card BusinessesOf the $1.9 billion of goodwill associated with the international consumer card businesses, $526 million of goodwill was allocated, on a relative fair value basis, to the Canadian consumer card business which was sold on December 1, 2011.During the three months ended December&#160;31, 2011, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer card businesses reporting unit as it was likely that the carrying amount of the business exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in future growth projections. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $581 million&#32;for the European consumer card businesses.Table of ContentsConsumer Real Estate ServicesIn connection with the sale of Balboa on June 1, 2011, we allocated, on a relative fair value basis, $193 million&#32;of CRES&#32;goodwill to the business in determining the gain on the sale.During the three months ended June 30, 2011, as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011, the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the CRES&#32;reporting unit. We concluded that the remaining balance of goodwill of $2.6 billion&#32;was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in CRES&#32;to zero.2011 Annual Impairment Test During the three months ended September 30, 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June&#160;30, 2011 for all reporting units which had goodwill. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying value, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premiums used in the June 30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 25 percent to 35 percent. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June&#160;30, 2011 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 11 percent to 16 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from 0.7 percent to 6.7 percent. For certain revenue and expense items that have been significantly affected by the current economic environment and financial reform, management developed separate long-term forecasts. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. 2010 Impairment TestsDuring the three months ended September 30, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment test for Card Services due to the continued stress on the business and the uncertain debit card interchange provisions under the Financial Reform Act. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion&#32;to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in Card Services.&nbsp;During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the CRES&#32;reporting unit as it was likely that there was a decline in its fair value as a result of increased uncertainties, including existing and potential litigation exposure and other related risks, higher servicing costs including those related to loss mitigation, foreclosure related issues and the redeployment of centralized sales resources. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 billion&#32;in CRES.Representations and WarrantiesThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default, estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan and the experience with and the behavior of the counterparty. It also considers bulk settlements, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability.The provision for representations and warranties may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimated range of possible loss related to non-GSE representations and warranties exposure has been disclosed. For the GSE claims where we have established a representations and warranties liability as discussed in Note 9 &#8211; Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, an assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10&#160;percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately $850 million&#32;or decrease of approximately $800 million&#32;in the representations and warranties liability as of December&#160;31, 2011. Viewed from the perspective of home prices, for each one percent change in home prices, the liability for representations and warranties on unsettled GSE originations is estimated to be impacted by $125 million&#32;based on projected collateral losses and defect rates. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.Table of ContentsFor additional information on representations and warranties, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations &#8211; Representations and Warranties&#32;on page 56, as well as Note 9 &#8211; Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees&#32;and Note 14 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Litigation ReserveIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in Note 14 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in Note 14 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure. Information is provided &nbsp;in Note 14 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies.Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest EntitiesIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, an entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and implicit contractual arrangements, and the entity's involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. The entity must then determine which activities have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that services the assets or makes investment management decisions may have the power to direct the most significant activities of a VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are no significant ongoing activities, the party that was responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees.On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.Table of Contents2010 Compared to 2009The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2010&#32;and 2009. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables 7&#32;and 8&#32;contain financial data to supplement this discussion.OverviewNet Income/LossNet loss totaled $2.2 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;compared to net income of $6.3 billion&#32;in 2009. Including preferred stock dividends, the net loss applicable to common shareholders was $3.6 billion, or $(0.37)&#32;per diluted share. Those results compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $2.2 billion, or $(0.29)&#32;per diluted share for 2009.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income on a FTE basis increased $4.3 billion to $52.7 billion&#32;for 2010&#32;compared to 2009. The increase was due to the impact of deposit pricing and the adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed $10.5 billion to net interest income in 2010. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First Republic in 2010 and lower rates on core assets and trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 bps to 2.78 percent&#32;for 2010&#32;compared to 2009&#32;due to the factors described above.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income decreased $13.8 billion&#32;to $58.7 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;compared to 2009. Card income decreased $245 million due to the implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income. Service charges decreased $1.6 billion largely due to the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Equity investment income decreased $4.8 billion, as net gains on the sales of certain strategic investments during 2010&#32;were less than gains in 2009 that included a $7.3 billion gain related to the sale of a portion of our investment in CCB. Trading account profits decreased $2.2 billion due to more favorable market conditions in 2009 and investor concerns regarding sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty. DVA gains, net of hedges, on derivative liabilities of $262 million for 2010 compared to losses of $662 million for 2009. Mortgage banking income decreased $6.1 billion due to an increase of $4.9 billion in representations and warranties provision and lower volume and margins. Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $2.2 billion driven by a lower volume of sales of debt securities. The decrease also included the impact of losses in 2010 related to portfolio restructuring activities. Other income (loss) improved by $2.4 billion. 2009 included a net negative fair value adjustment related to our own credit of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010, and 2009 also included a $3.8 billion gain on the contribution of our merchant services business to a joint venture. Legacy asset write-downs included in other income (loss) were $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to net gains of $256 million in 2010. Impairment losses recognized in earnings on AFS debt &nbsp;securities decreased $1.9 billion reflecting lower impairment write-downs on non-agency RMBS and CDOs.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $20.1 billion&#32;to $28.4 billion&#32;for 2010&#32;compared to 2009&#32;due to improving portfolio trends across the consumer and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs totaled $34.3&#160;billion, or 3.60&#160;percent of average loans and leases for 2010&#32;compared to $33.7&#160;billion, or 3.58&#160;percent for 2009.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense increased $16.4 billion&#32;to $83.1 billion&#32;for 2010&#32;compared to 2009&#32;largely due to goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion. The increase was also driven by a $3.6 billion increase in personnel costs reflecting the build out of several businesses, the recognition of expense on proportionally larger 2009 incentive deferrals and the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments, as well as a $1.6 billion increase in litigation costs. These increases were partially offset by a $901 million decline in merger and restructuring charges compared to 2009. Noninterest expense for 2009 included a special FDIC assessment of $724 million. Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense was $915 million&#32;for 2010&#32;compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion&#32;for 2009. The effective tax rate in 2010&#32;was not meaningful due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges of $12.4 billion. The effective tax rate for 2010&#32;excluding goodwill impairment charges was 8.3 percent compared to (44.0) percent in 2009. The change in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax income excluding the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. Also impacting the 2010 effective tax rate was a $392 million charge from a U.K. law change and a $1.7 billion tax benefit from the release of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits compared to $650 million in 2009.Business Segment OperationsDepositsNet income decreased $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;due to a decline in revenue and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.1 billion to $8.3 billion&#32;as a result of a customer shift to more liquid products and continued pricing discipline, partially offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Noninterest income decreased $1.8 billion to $5.3 billion&#32;driven by the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E, which was effective in the third quarter of 2010, and our overdraft policy changes implemented in late 2009. Noninterest expense increased $1.5 billion to $11.2 billion&#32;as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service costs was aligned to Deposits&#32;from the other segments, and increased litigation expenses partially offset by a decrease in FDIC expenses as 2009&#32;included a special assessment.Table of ContentsCard ServicesCard Services&#32;recorded a net loss of $7.0 billion&#32;primarily due to a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Net interest income decreased $2.1 billion to $14.4 billion&#32;driven by a decrease in average loans and yields partially offset by lower funding costs. Noninterest income decreased $348 million to $7.9 billion&#32;driven by lower card income primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act partially offset by higher interchange income during 2010 and the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position. The provision for credit losses improved $15.4 billion to $11.0 billion&#32;due to lower delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of the improved economic environment, which resulted in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2010 compared to an increase in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $9.8 billion to $16.4 billion&#32;primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge.Consumer Real Estate ServicesCRES&#32;net loss increased $5.1 billion to a net loss of $8.9 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;primarily due to a $4.9 billion increase in representations and warranties provision and a $2.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by a decline in the provision for credit losses driven by improving portfolio trends. Mortgage banking income declined driven by the increased representations and warranties provision and lower production volume reflecting a drop in the overall size of the mortgage market. The provision for credit losses decreased $2.8 billion to $8.5 billion&#32;driven by improving portfolio trends which led to lower reserve additions, including those associated with the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $3.4 billion to $14.9 billion&#32;due to the goodwill impairment charge, higher litigation expense and an increase in default-related servicing expense, partially offset by lower production expense and insurance losses.Global Commercial BankingNet income increased $1.0 billion to $3.2 billion&#32;in 2010. Net interest income remained relatively flat as growth in average deposits was offset by a lower net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Noninterest income decreased $4.2 billion to $3.2 billion&#32;largely due to the 2009 gain of $3.8 billion related to the contribution of the merchant services business into a joint venture. The provision for credit losses decreased $5.8 billion to $2.0 billion&#32;driven by improvements from stabilizing values in the commercial real estate portfolio and improved borrower credit profiles in the U.S. commercial portfolio. Global Banking & MarketsNet income decreased $1.4 billion to $6.3 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;driven by lower sales and trading revenue due to more favorable market conditions in 2009, partially offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities and gains on legacy assets compared to losses &nbsp;in 2009. Sales and trading revenue was $17.0 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;compared to $17.6 billion in 2009&#32;due to increased investor risk aversion and more favorable market conditions in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $2.3 billion to $17.5 billion&#32;driven by higher compensation costs as a result of the recognition of expense on a proportionally larger amount of prior year incentive deferrals and investments in infrastructure and personnel associated with further development of the business. Income tax expense was adversely affected by a charge related to the U.K. tax rate reduction impacting the carrying value of deferred tax assets.Global Wealth & Investment ManagementNet income decreased $329 million to $1.3 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;driven by higher noninterest expense and the tax-related effect of the sale of the Columbia Management long-term asset management business partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower credit costs. Net interest income decreased $205 million to $5.7 billion&#32;as the positive impact of higher deposit levels was more than offset by lower revenue from corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased $708 million to $10.6 billion&#32;primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by stronger markets, continued long-term AUM flows and higher transactional activity. The provision for credit losses decreased $414 million to $646 million&#32;driven by improving portfolio trends and the recognition of a single large commercial charge-off in 2009. Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion to $13.2 billion&#32;due primarily to higher revenue-related expenses, support costs and personnel costs associated with further investment in the business.All OtherNet income increased $293 million to $1.5 billion&#32;in 2010. Net interest income decreased $1.9 billion to $3.7 billion&#32;driven by a $1.4 billion lower funding differential on certain securitizations and the impact of capital raises occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the businesses. Noninterest income decreased $5.7 billion to $6.0 billion&#32;as the prior year included a $7.3 billion gain resulting from a sale of shares of CCB and an increase of $1.4 billion on net gains on the sale of debt securities. This was offset by net negative fair value adjustments related to our own credit of $4.9 billion on structured liabilities in 2009 compared to a net positive adjustment of $18 million in 2010 and higher valuation adjustments and gains on sales of select investments in GPI. Also, in 2010, we sold our investments in Ita&#250; Unibanco and Santander resulting in a net gain of approximately $800 million, as well as the gains on CCB and BlackRock.&#32;The provision for credit losses decreased $4.9 billion to $6.3 billion&#32;due to improving portfolio trends in the residential mortgage portfolio partially offset by further deterioration in the Countrywide PCI discontinued real estate portfolio.Table of ContentsStatistical TablesTable of ContentsTable of ContentsTable of ContentsTable of Contentsn/a = not applicableTable of Contentsn/a = not applicableTable of Contentsn/a = not applicableTable of Contentsn/a&#160;=&#160;not applicableTable of Contentsn/a = not applicableTable of ContentsTable of Contentsn/m = not meaningfulTable of ContentsTable of ContentsFor footnotes see page&#160;140.Table of Contentsn/m = not meaningfulTable of ContentsTable of ContentsTable of ContentsTable of ContentsFor footnotes see page 145.<hr
