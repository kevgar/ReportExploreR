>Table 38&#32;presents TDRs for the home loans portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans in Table 37.We work with customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans, while complying with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. Substantially all of our credit card and other consumer loan modifications involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, both of which are considered to be TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). We make modifications primarily through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is generally excluded from Table 37&#32;as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. The renegotiated TDR portfolio included $58 million&#32;of non-real estate-secured loans at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;that were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a result of new regulatory guidance and classified as nonperforming loans. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $3.9 billion&#32;and $7.1 billion, of which $3.1 billion&#32;and $5.5 billion&#32;were current or less than 30&#160;days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower new program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, &nbsp;cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses.For information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Management of Commercial Credit RiskConcentrationsCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our international portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 43, 48, 56&#32;and 57&#32;summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs.We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation's credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the &nbsp;cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss).Commercial Credit PortfolioTable 39&#32;presents our commercial loans and leases, and related credit quality information at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011.Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased&#32;$37.6 billion&#32;in 2012, primarily in non-U.S. commercial and U.S. commercial. During 2012, credit quality in the commercial loan portfolio continued to show improvement relative to the prior year. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed property balances in the commercial credit portfolio declined during 2012&#32;and the declines were primarily in the commercial real estate and U.S. commercial portfolios. Commercial real estate continued to show improvement in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. The reduction in reservable criticized U.S. commercial loans was driven by broad-based improvements in terms of clients, industries and businesses. Most other credit indicators across the remaining commercial portfolios also improved in 2012. The allowance for loan and lease losses declined $1.0 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2011&#32;to $3.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;due to improvements &nbsp;in the core commercial portfolio (total commercial products excluding U.S. small business). For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses&#32;on page 109. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases was 0.91 percent&#32;and 2.02 percent&#32;(0.93 percent&#32;and 2.04 percent&#32;excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. Accruing commercial loans and leases past due 90 days or more as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases was 0.06 percent&#32;and 0.10 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. Table 40&#32;presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for 2012&#32;and 2011. Improving portfolio trends drove lower charge-offs across most of the portfolio. Table 41&#32;presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased&#32;$16.5 billion&#32;in 2012&#32;primarily driven by increases in loans and LHFS, partially offset by decreases in derivative assets, and SBLCs and financial guarantees.&nbsp;Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased&#32;$5.2 billion&#32;in 2012&#32;primarily driven by the same factors as total commercial committed exposure as described in the previous paragraph. The decrease in derivatives relates primarily to a lower valuation of existing trades due to interest rate decreases along with reduced trading volume. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers' acceptances was 58 percent&#32;and 57 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011.Table 42&#32;presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by product type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;$11.3 billion, or 42 percent, in 2012&#32;primarily in commercial real estate and U.S. &nbsp;commercial property types driven largely by continued paydowns, rating upgrades, charge-offs and sales outpacing downgrades. At December&#160;31, 2012, approximately 82 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured compared to 85 percent at December&#160;31, 2011.U.S. CommercialAt December&#160;31, 2012, 68 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 10 percent in Global Markets, 10 percent in CBB and the remainder primarily in&#32;GWIM&#32;(business-purpose loans for wealthy clients). U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased&#32;$17.2 billion, or 10 percent, in 2012&#32;primarily due to greater client demand in middle-market segments, dealer financing and specialized industries, and growth in certain asset-backed lending products. Reservable criticized balances and nonperforming loans and leases declined&#32;$3.1 billion&#32;and $690 million&#32;in 2012. The declines were broad-based in terms of clients and industries and were driven by improved client credit profiles and liquidity. Net charge-offs increased&#32;$47 million&#32;in 2012&#32;due primarily to lower recoveries compared to 2011.Commercial Real EstateThe commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking&#32;and consists of loans made primarily to public and &nbsp;private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans decreased&#32;$959 million, or two percent, in 2012&#32;due to paydowns outpacing new originations and renewals.The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent&#32;and 20 percent&#32;of commercial real estate loans and leases at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. Commercial real estate credit quality improved significantly during 2012. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased&#32;$2.7 billion, or 61 percent, in 2012&#32;primarily in the non-residential portfolio. Reservable criticized balances decreased&#32;$7.7 billion, or 67 percent, primarily due to declines in the non-residential portfolio. Net charge-offs declined&#32;$563 million&#32;in 2012&#32;compared to 2011 due to improvement in both the residential and non-residential portfolios.Table 43&#32;presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type. Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate which is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment.During 2012, we continued to see improvements in both the residential and non-residential portfolios; however, portions of the non-residential portfolio in certain markets may be subject to additional risk. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce utilized and potential exposure in the &nbsp;commercial real estate portfolios including ongoing refinement of our credit standards, additional transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Tables 44&#32;and 45&#32;present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-residential and residential property types. The residential portfolio presented in Tables 43, 44&#32;and 45&#32;includes condominiums and other residential real estate. Other property &nbsp;types in Tables 43, 44&#32;and 45&#32;primarily include special purpose, nursing/retirement homes, medical facilities and restaurants, as well as unsecured loans to borrowers whose primary business is commercial real estate.At December&#160;31, 2012, total committed non-residential exposure was $54.5 billion compared to $53.1 billion at December&#160;31, 2011, of which $37.0 billion and $37.2 billion were funded secured loans. Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties were $1.4 billion&#32;and $3.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011, which represented 3.68 percent and 9.29 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties. The decline in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-residential portfolio was driven by decreases in the office, industrial/warehouse, shopping centers/retail and multi-family rental property types. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;to $3.2 billion, or 8.27 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure, at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to $10.1 billion, or 25.34 percent, at December&#160;31, 2011&#32;primarily driven by repayments and an overall improvement in credit quality. The decrease in reservable criticized exposure was primarily driven by office, multi-family rental, industrial/warehouse and shopping centers/retail property types in the non-residential portfolio. For the non-residential portfolio, net charge-offs decreased&#32;$379 million&#32;in 2012&#32;&nbsp;compared to 2011 primarily due to improving appraisal values, improved borrower credit profiles and higher recoveries.At December&#160;31, 2012, total committed residential exposure was $3.2 billion compared to $3.9 billion at December&#160;31, 2011, of which $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion were funded secured loans. The decline in residential committed exposure was due to repayments, net charge-offs, and continued risk reduction and mitigation initiatives in line with our portfolio strategy. Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased&#32;$600 million&#32;in 2012&#32;due to repayments, a decline in the volume of loans being downgraded to nonaccrual status and net charge-offs. Residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;$884 million&#32;to $534 million&#32;due to repayments and net charge-offs. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 23.33 percent and 31.56 percent at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to 38.89 percent and 54.65 percent at December&#160;31, 2011. Net charge-offs for the residential portfolio decreased&#32;$184 million&#32;in 2012&#32;compared to 2011.At December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $6.7 billion and $10.9 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. The decline in construction and land development loans was driven by repayments, net charge-offs, continued risk mitigation initiatives and a reduced emphasis on new originations. This portfolio is mostly secured and diversified across property types and geographic regions but faces continuing challenges in the housing markets. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $1.5 billion and $4.9 billion, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $730 million and $2.1 billion at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. Loans generally continue to be classified as construction loans until operating cash flows reach appropriate levels or the loans are refinanced. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve.Non-U.S. CommercialAt December&#160;31, 2012, 72 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 28 percent in&#32;Global Markets. Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased&#32;$18.8 billion&#32;in 2012&#32;primarily due to increased client financing activity, structured lending and trade finance exposures. Net charge-offs decreased&#32;$124 million&#32;in 2012&#32;compared to 2011. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio&#32;on page 105.U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card and small business loans managed in CBB. Card-related products were 45 percent and 46 percent of the U.S. &nbsp;small business commercial portfolio at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs decreased&#32;$296 million&#32;in 2012&#32;compared to 2011&#32;driven by improvements in delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies resulting from an improved economic environment as well as the reduction of higher risk vintages and the impact of higher credit quality originations. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 58 percent were credit card-related products in 2012&#32;compared to 74 percent in 2011.Commercial Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value&#32;OptionThe portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is managed primarily in Global Banking. Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option increased&#32;$1.4 billion&#32;to an aggregate fair value of $8.0 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;primarily due to increased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net gains of $213 million&#32;in 2012&#32;compared to net losses of $174 million&#32;in 2011&#32;resulting from changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $528 million&#32;and $1.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011&#32;which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $18.3 billion&#32;and $25.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. We recorded net gains of $704 million&#32;from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit during 2012&#32;compared to net losses of $429 million&#32;in 2011&#32;resulting from maturities and terminations at par value and changes in the fair value of the loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income (loss) and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 46&#32;presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2012&#32;and 2011. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased&#32;$3.1 billion&#32;to $3.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;driven by paydowns, charge-offs and sales outpacing new nonperforming loans. Approximately 94 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, &nbsp;leases and foreclosed properties are secured and approximately 45 percent are contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 76 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less estimated costs to sell.Table 47&#32;presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than &nbsp;the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For additional information on TDRs, see Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Industry ConcentrationsTable 48&#32;presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total committed commercial credit exposure increased&#32;$16.5 billion, or two percent, to $767.0 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012. The increase&#32;in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in food, beverage and tobacco, banking, energy, diversified financials, and real estate, partially offset by lower exposure to government and public education.Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. Management's Credit Risk Committee (CRC) oversees industry limit governance. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration, experienced an increase&#32;in committed exposure of $4.7 billion, or five percent, in 2012&#32;primarily driven by increases in margin loans and certain asset-backed lending products, partially offset by a decrease in derivative exposure.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration, experienced an increase&#32;in committed exposure of $3.1 billion, or five percent, in 2012&#32;primarily due to new originations and renewals outpacing paydowns and sales. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 14 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at December&#160;31, 2012, down from 20 percent at December&#160;31, 2011. For more information on &nbsp;commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Real Estate&#32;on page 98.Committed exposure in the food, beverage and tobacco industry increased&#32;$6.8 billion, or 22 percent, in 2012&#32;primarily related to short-term acquisition financing. Government and public education committed exposure decreased&#32;$6.7 billion, or 12 percent, in 2012&#32;primarily driven by decreases in loans and SBLCs. Banking committed exposure increased&#32;$6.5 billion, or 17 percent, in 2012&#32;primarily driven by loans to mortgage finance companies and trade finance activity with non-U.S. banks. Energy committed exposure increased&#32;$6.4 billion, or 20 percent, in 2012&#32;reflecting loan growth in the exploration and production, and integrated oil sectors.Our committed state and municipal exposure of $38.0 billion at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;consisted of $30.9 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $17.6 billion of funded loans, $8.9 billion of SBLCs and $3.6 billion of derivative assets) and unfunded commercial exposure of $7.2 billion (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 48. While the slow economic recovery continues to pressure budgets, most U.S. state and local governments have implemented offsetting fiscal adjustments and continue to honor debt obligations as agreed. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications are regularly circulated to maintain exposure levels and are in compliance with established concentration guidelines.Monoline ExposureMonoline exposure is reported in the insurance industry and managed under insurance portfolio industry limits. We have indirect exposure to monolines primarily in the form of guarantees supporting our loans, investment portfolios, securitizations and credit-enhanced securities as part of our public finance business and other selected products. Such indirect exposure exists when we purchase credit protection from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain credit exposures including loans and CDOs. We underwrite our public finance exposure by evaluating the underlying securities.We also have indirect exposure to monolines in the form of guarantees supporting our mortgage and other loan sales. Indirect exposure may exist when credit protection was purchased from monolines to hedge all or a portion of the credit risk on certain mortgage and other loan exposures. A loss may occur when we are required to repurchase a loan and the market value of the loan has declined, or we are required to indemnify or provide recourse for a guarantor's loss. For additional information regarding our exposure to representations and warranties, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations &#8211; Representations and Warranties&#32;on page 54&#32;and Note 8 &#8211; Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. &nbsp;Table 49&#32;presents the notional amount of our monoline derivative credit exposure, mark-to-market adjustment and the counterparty credit valuation adjustment.The notional amount of monoline exposure at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;decreased&#32;$7.5 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2011&#32;due to terminations, paydowns and maturities of monoline contracts. In addition, $1.3 billion of monoline exposure with a single counterparty ($4.9 billion gross receivable less impairment) was included in other assets at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. The contracts are no longer considered to be derivative trading instruments because of the inherent default risk and they no longer provide a hedge benefit. We also have potential representations and warranties exposure with the same counterparty. Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $14.7 billion&#32;and $19.4 billion. The mark-to-market effects resulted in net losses of $1.0 billion in 2012&#32;compared to net gains of $121 million in 2011. The gains and losses related to these instruments are offset by gains and losses on the exposures. Table 50&#32;presents the average VaR for these derivatives. See Trading Risk Management&#32;on page 114&#32;for a description of our VaR calculation for the market-based trading portfolio.&nbsp;Tables 51&#32;and 52&#32;present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker/dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to &nbsp;settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.Table 53&#32;presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts and collateral with that counterparty. The contract/notional amounts of credit derivatives decreased primarily due to portfolio optimization and increased utilization of clearinghouses in relation to certain regulatory initiatives and refinement of risk mitigation activities. For information on written credit derivatives, &nbsp;see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 53&#32;take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements, while amounts disclosed in Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.n/a = not applicableCounterparty Credit Risk Valuation AdjustmentsWe record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments (CVA) on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. Table 54&#32;presents credit valuation gains (losses), net of hedges, for 2012&#32;and 2011. In 2012, we refined our methodology for CVA on derivatives on a prospective basis. We no longer consider the probability of default for both the counterparty and the Corporation when calculating the counterparty CVA and now only consider the probability of the counterparty defaulting for CVA. For more information, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The effect of this change in estimate on CVA is reflected in the table below. Credit valuation gains for 2012&#32;were due to improved counterparty creditworthiness, partially offset by hedge results. For information on our monoline counterparty credit risk, see Monoline Exposure&#32;on page 103.Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management &nbsp;framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S.&#160;risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is provided by the Country Credit Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the CRC. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (for example, related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through the country risk governance.Table 55&#32;presents our total non-U.S. exposure broken out by region at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. Risk assignments by country can be adjusted for externally guaranteed loans outstanding and certain collateral types. Exposures which are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Our total non-U.S. exposure was $281.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, an increase&#32;of $44.6 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2011. The increase in non-U.S. exposure was driven by our strategy to grow non-U.S. business in select countries and diversify risk globally. Our non-U.S. exposure remained concentrated in Europe which accounted for $137.8 billion, or 49 percent&#32;of total non-U.S. exposure. The European exposure was mostly in Western Europe and was distributed across a variety of industries. Select European countries are further detailed in Table 57. Asia Pacific was our second largest non-U.S. exposure at $92.4 billion, or 33 percent&#32;of total non-U.S. exposure. Latin America accounted for $21.2 billion, or eight percent&#32;of total non-U.S.&#160;exposure. Middle East and Africa accounted for $8.2 billion, or three percent&#32;of total non-U.S. exposure. Other non-U.S. exposure accounted for $22.0 billion&#32;or approximately seven percent&#32;of total non-U.S. exposure. For information on country specific exposures, see Tables 56&#32;and 57.Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases and other extensions of credit or funds including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral or credit default protection. Funded loans are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS) and secured financing transactions. Derivative &nbsp;exposures are reported net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures have been reduced by eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral. Counterparty exposure has not been reduced by hedges or credit default protection.Securities and other investments are marked-to-market and long positions are netted against short positions with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero). Other investments includes our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as index and tranche CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount less any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche.Table 56&#32;presents our 20 largest, non-U.S. country exposures. These exposures accounted for 89 percent&#32;of our total non-U.S. exposure at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to 88 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011.Certain European countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress in recent years. Risks from the ongoing debt crisis in these countries could continue to disrupt the financial markets which could have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. In the fourth quarter of 2012, European policymakers continued to make incremental progress toward greater fiscal and monetary unity; however, fundamental issues of competitiveness, growth and fiscal solvency remain as challenges. As a result, volatility is expected to continue. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile.&nbsp;Table 57&#32;presents our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures in these countries at December&#160;31, 2012. Our total sovereign and non-sovereign exposure to these countries was $14.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to $15.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011. The total exposure to these countries, net of all hedges, was $9.5 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to $10.3 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011, of which $280 million&#32;and $362 million&#32;was sovereign exposure. At December&#160;31, 2012&#32;and 2011, the value of hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold, was $5.1 billion&#32;and $4.9 billion.The majority of our CDS contracts on reference assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain are with highly-rated financial institutions primarily outside of the Eurozone and we work to limit or eliminate correlated CDS. Due to our engagement in market-making activities, our CDS portfolio contains contracts with various maturities to a diverse set of counterparties. We work to &nbsp;limit mismatches in maturities between our exposures and the CDS we use to hedge them. However, there may be instances where the protection purchased has a different maturity from the exposure for which the protection was purchased, in which case, those exposures and hedges are subject to more active monitoring and management.Table 58&#32;presents the notional and fair value amounts of single-name CDS purchased and sold on reference assets in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Table 58&#32;includes only single-name CDS netted at the counterparty level, whereas, Table 57&#32;includes single-name, indexed and tranched CDS positions netted by the reference asset that they are intended to hedge; therefore, CDS purchased and sold information is not comparable between tables.Losses could result even if there is credit default protection purchased because the purchased credit protection contracts only pay out under certain scenarios and thus not all losses may be covered by the credit protection contracts. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of these risks is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS. &nbsp;Generally, only the occurrence of a credit event as defined by the CDS terms (which may include, among other events, the failure to pay by, or restructuring of, the reference entity) results in a payment under the purchased credit protection contracts. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Determination Committee (comprised of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and facts and circumstances for the event. Accordingly, uncertainties exist as to whether any particular strategy or policy action for addressing the European debt crisis would constitute a credit event under the CDS. A voluntary restructuring may not trigger a credit event under CDS terms and consequently may not trigger a payment under the CDS contract.In addition to our direct sovereign and non-sovereign exposures, a significant deterioration of the European debt crisis could result in material reductions in the value of sovereign debt and other asset classes, disruptions in capital markets, widening of credit spreads of U.S. and other financial institutions, loss of investor confidence in the financial services industry, a slowdown in global economic activity and other adverse developments. For additional information on the debt crisis in Europe, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.Table 59&#32;presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. Cross-border exposures are calculated using FFIEC guidelines and not our internal risk management view; therefore, exposures are not comparable between tables. Exposure includes cross-border claims by our non-U.S.&#160;offices including loans, acceptances, time deposits placed, trading account assets, securities, derivative assets, other interest-earning investments and other monetary assets. Amounts also include unfunded commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees, and the notional value of cash lent under secured financing transactions. Sector definitions are consistent with FFIEC reporting requirements for preparing the Country Exposure Report. At December&#160;31, 2012, the United Kingdom, France and Canada were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. No other countries had exposure exceeding 0.75 percent&#32;of our total assets. Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased&#32;$5.2 billion&#32;to $8.2 billion&#32;for 2012&#32;compared to 2011. The provision for credit losses was $6.7 billion&#32;lower than net charge-offs for 2012, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses due to improved portfolio trends and increasing home prices in the consumer real estate portfolios, lower bankruptcy filings and delinquencies affecting the Card Services portfolio, and improvement in overall credit quality within the core commercial portfolio (total commercial products excluding U.S. small business). Absent unexpected deterioration in the economy, we expect reductions in the allowance for credit losses, excluding the valuation allowance for PCI loans, to continue in the near term, though at a slower pace than in 2012.The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased&#32;$6.4 billion&#32;to $8.0 billion&#32;for 2012&#32;compared to 2011. The improvement was primarily in the consumer real estate loan portfolios due to improved portfolio trends and an improved home price outlook in our PCI portfolios. The provision for credit losses related to the PCI loan portfolios was a provision benefit&#32;of $103 million&#32;in 2012&#32;as the home price outlook improved, compared to a provision expense&#32;of $2.2 billion&#32;in 2011.The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including the unfunded lending commitments, increased&#32;$1.1 billion&#32;to $197 million&#32;in 2012&#32;compared to 2011&#32;due to stabilization of credit quality, loan growth and a higher volume of loan resolutions in the prior year, all within the core commercial portfolio.Allowance for Credit LossesAllowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both the nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated credit card, unsecured consumer and small business TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.The second component of the allowance for loan and lease &nbsp;losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses which are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December&#160;31, 2012, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for all major consumer portfolios.The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated at least quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD&#160;based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. As of December&#160;31, 2012, updates to the loan risk ratings and portfolio composition resulted in reductions in the allowance for the commercial real estate, U.S. commercial and commercial lease financing portfolios.Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans and the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.During 2012, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included significant overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs, specifically in the home loans portfolios, has impacted the amount of reserve needed in that portfolio. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels, a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings, a rise in both residential building activity and overall home prices. In addition to these improvements, paydowns, charge-offs and returns to performing status and upgrades out of criticized continued to outpace new nonaccrual consumer loans and reservable criticized commercial loans, but such loans remained elevated relative to levels experienced prior to the financial crisis. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 61, was $21.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, a decrease&#32;of $8.6 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2011. The decrease&#32;in the home equity and residential mortgage allowance was primarily driven by improved delinquencies and home prices as evidenced by improving LTV statistics as presented in Tables 25&#32;and 27. In addition, the home equity allowance declined due to reduced exposures to current junior-lien loans that we estimate had a first-lien loan that was 90 days or more past due. Also, the home equity allowance related to the PCI portfolio declined $2.7 billion&#32;primarily due to the &nbsp;forgiveness of fully reserved home equity loans in connection with the National Mortgage Settlement. The decrease in the allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in CBB&#32;was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and bankruptcies. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased&#32;to $2.7 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;from $3.8 billion&#32;(to 2.90 percent&#32;from 3.74 percent&#32;of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December&#160;31, 2011, and accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased&#32;to $1.4 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;from $2.1 billion&#32;(to 1.52 percent&#32;from 2.02 percent&#32;of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) over the same period. See Tables 22, 23, 25, 27, 33&#32;and 35&#32;for additional details on key consumer credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio as presented in Table 61&#32;was $3.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012, a decrease&#32;of $1.0 billion&#32;from December&#160;31, 2011. The decrease&#32;was driven by continued improvement in the credit quality of the core commercial portfolio. For example, the commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased&#32;to $15.9 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;from $27.2 billion&#32;(to 4.10 percent&#32;from 7.41 percent&#32;of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December&#160;31, 2011. Similarly, nonperforming commercial loans declined&#32;to $3.2 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;from $6.3 billion&#32;(to 0.93 percent&#32;from 2.04 percent&#32;of outstanding commercial loans) at December&#160;31, 2011. See Tables 39, 40&#32;and 42&#32;for additional details on key commercial credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 2.69 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to 3.68 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011. The decrease&#32;in the ratio was largely due to improved credit quality driven by improved economic conditions and the home equity PCI loans that were forgiven which led to the reduction in the allowance for credit losses discussed above. The December 31, 2012 and 2011&#32;ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 2.14 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to 2.86 percent&#32;at December&#160;31, 2011.Table 60&#32;presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for 2012&#32;and 2011.For reporting purposes, we allocate the allowance for credit losses across products. However, the allowance is generally available to absorb any credit losses without restriction. Table 61&#32;presents our allocation by product type.Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;was $513 million, $201 million&#32;lower&#32;than December&#160;31, 2011&#32;driven by improved credit quality in the unfunded portfolio and accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on acquired Merrill Lynch unfunded positions.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market-sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business, customer and other trading operations, the ALM process, credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities. In the event of market volatility, factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the Corporation.Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, primarily changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. For further information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various risk factors, which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as mortgage, equity, commodity, issuer, credit and market liquidity risk factors. We seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets. The following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques.&nbsp;Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S.&#160;interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.Mortgage RiskMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including CDOs using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. See Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;and Note 24 &#8211; Mortgage Servicing Rights&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for additional information on MSRs. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include contracts and derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards.Equity Market RiskEquity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.Commodity RiskCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.Issuer Credit RiskIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.Market Liquidity RiskMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.&nbsp;Trading Risk ManagementTrading-related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment.The Global Markets Risk Committee (GMRC), chaired by the Global Markets Risk Executive, has been designated by ALMRC as the primary governance authority for global markets risk management including trading risk management. The GMRC's focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting Global Markets&#32;and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets&#32;are monitored and governed by their respective governance authorities.The GMRC monitors significant daily revenues and losses by business and the primary drivers of the revenues or losses. Thresholds are in place for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business. If any of the thresholds are exceeded, an explanation of the variance is provided to the GMRC. The thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses that exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility.The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2012&#32;and 2011. During 2012, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98&#160;percent, or 243 of the 249 trading days of which 80&#160;percent (199 days) were daily trading gains of over $25&#160;million, less than one percent (1 day) of the trading days had losses greater &nbsp;than $25&#160;million and the largest loss was $50&#160;million. This is compared to 2011, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 86&#160;percent, or 214 of the 250 trading days of which 66&#160;percent (165 days) were daily trading gains of over $25&#160;million, five percent (12 days) of the trading days had losses greater than $25&#160;million and the largest loss was $119&#160;million.To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. VaR is a key statistic used to measure market risk. In order to manage day-to-day risks, VaR is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses. All trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review.A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience within a given confidence level based on historical data. With any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. In addition, the accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have extensive historical price data or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available.&nbsp;A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. There are, however, many limitations inherent in a VaR model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance. Historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a bi-weekly basis and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. Our VaR model utilizes three years of historical data. This time period was chosen to ensure that VaR reflects both a broad range of market movements as well as being sensitive to recent changes in market volatility. In addition, certain types of risks associated with positions that are illiquid and/or unobservable are not included in VaR. If these risks are determined to be material, the VaR model results will be supplemented.We continually review, evaluate and enhance our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate governance committees. Nevertheless, due to the limitations previously discussed, we have historically used the VaR model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees.The accuracy of the VaR methodology is reviewed by backtesting which compares the VaR results from historical data against the actual daily profit and loss. Graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the GMRC. Backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. In periods of market stress, &nbsp;the GMRC members communicate daily to discuss losses and VaR limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Where economically feasible, positions are sold or macroeconomic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure.We use one VaR model that uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and an expected shortfall methodology equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VaR, on average, one out of 100 trading days, or two to three times each year. The number of actual backtesting excesses observed is dependent on current market performance relative to historic market volatility. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR in 2012&#32;or 2011. The graph below shows daily trading-related revenue and VaR for 2012. The large gains in daily trading-related revenue reflected near the end of the year, are due in part to above average activity in the markets leading up to news about the fiscal cliff.Table 62&#32;presents average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2012&#32;and 2011.The $92 million&#32;decrease in average VaR during 2012&#32;was driven by reduced risk across most asset classes, with the largest reductions coming from the credit, real estate/mortgage and equities asset classes. In addition, volatile market data from 2008, which was a material contribution to the 2011 average, was no longer included in the three-year historical dataset for the 2012 average. Counterparty credit risk is an adjustment to the mark-to-market value of our derivative exposures to reflect the impact of the credit quality of counterparties on our derivative assets. Since counterparty credit exposure is not included in the VaR component of the regulatory capital allocation, we do not include it in our trading VaR, and it is therefore not included in the daily trading-related revenue illustrated in our histogram or used for backtesting.Trading Portfolio Stress TestingBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited lookback window, we also stress test our portfolio. Stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. Various scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are regularly run and reported for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes that occurred during a set of extended historical market events. Generally, a 10-business-day window or longer, representing the most severe point during a crisis, is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of anticipated shocks from pre-defined market stress events. These stress events include shocks to underlying market risk variables which may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. As with the historical scenarios, the hypothetical scenarios are designed to represent a short-term market disruption. Scenarios are reviewed and updated as necessary in light of changing positions and new economic or political information. For example, we currently include stress tests that contemplate a full or partial break-up of the Eurozone. In addition to the value afforded by the results themselves, this information provides senior management with a clear picture of the trend of risk being taken given the relatively static nature of the shocks applied. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is also integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. A process is in place to promote consistency between the scenarios used for the trading portfolio and those used for enterprise-wide stress testing. The scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital &nbsp;and liquidity planning. For additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see page 68.Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading ActivitiesThe following discussion presents net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities.Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics, but do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect core net interest income and capital.The spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecast at December 31, 2012 and 2011&#32;are presented in Table 63.Table 64&#32;shows the pre-tax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2012 and 2011, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. For more information, see Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income on page&#160;36.The sensitivity analysis in Table 64&#32;assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks. Our net interest income was asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. SecuritiesThe securities portfolio is an integral part of our ALM positioning and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and to a lesser extent U.S.&#160;Treasury, corporate, municipal and other debt securities. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held AFS debt securities with a fair value of $286.9 billion&#32;and $276.2 billion. During 2012&#32;and 2011, we purchased AFS debt and other securities of $164.5 billion&#32;and $99.5 billion, sold $72.4 billion&#32;and $116.8 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $71.5 billion&#32;and $56.7 billion. We realized $1.7 billion&#32;and $3.4 billion&#32;in net gains on sales of debt securities during 2012&#32;and 2011. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held $49.5 billion&#32;and $35.3 billion&#32;of held-to-maturity securities and $14.5 billion of other securities classified as other assets. There were no securities classified as other assets during 2011.Accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of $4.4 billion&#32;and $3.1 billion&#32;on AFS debt securities and $462 million&#32;and $3 million&#32;on AFS marketable equity securities at December 31, 2012 and 2011. For additional information on accumulated OCI, see Note 15 &#8211; Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amount of pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS debt securities increased $2.1 billion&#32;during 2012&#32;to $7.0 billion, primarily due to the impact of lower rates. For additional information on our securities portfolio, see Note 4 &#8211; Securities&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.&nbsp;We recognized $53 million&#32;of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses in earnings on AFS debt securities in 2012&#32;compared to $299 million&#32;in 2011. The recognition of OTTI is based on a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer of the security including credit ratings and any specific events affecting the operations of the issuer, underlying assets that collateralize the debt security, other industry and macroeconomic conditions, and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery.Residential Mortgage PortfolioAt December 31, 2012 and 2011, our residential mortgage portfolio was $243.2 billion&#32;and $262.3 billion&#32;which excluded $9.9 billion&#32;and $11.1 billion&#32;of discontinued real estate loans and $1.0 billion&#32;and $2.2 billion&#32;of consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option&#32;on page 93. The $19.1 billion&#32;decrease&#32;in 2012&#32;was due to paydowns, charge-offs and transfers to foreclosed properties which more than offset new origination volume and repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA.During 2012, CRES&#32;and GWIM&#32;originated $35.4 billion in first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $45.5 billion in 2011. Additionally, we repurchased $8.2 billion of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA compared to repurchases of $7.8 billion in 2011. We received paydowns of $53.0&#160;billion in 2012 compared to paydowns of $42.3 billion in 2011. There were no purchases of residential mortgages related to ALM activities in 2012&#32;compared to $72 million in 2011. We sold $305&#160;million of residential mortgages in 2012&#32;compared to $109 million in 2011, all of which were originated residential mortgages. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages in both periods were minimal.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For additional information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2012&#32;reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. Table 65&#32;presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and market risk hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and &nbsp;average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2012 and 2011. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax, were $2.9 billion&#32;and $3.8 billion&#32;at December 31, 2012 and 2011. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December&#160;31, 2012, the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $1.0 billion, or 22 percent within the next year, 58 percent in years two through five, and 13 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining seven percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps, foreign exchange options and foreign currency-denominated debt. We recorded after-tax gains on derivatives and foreign currency-denominated debt in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by losses on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December&#160;31, 2012.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and service fee income. Typically, a decline in mortgage interest rates will lead to an increase in mortgage originations and fees and a decrease in the value of the MSRs driven by higher prepayment expectations. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. To hedge interest rate risk, we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options. These instruments are used to hedge certain market risks of IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the IRLCs and residential first mortgage LHFS was $31.1&#160;billion and $14.7&#160;billion.MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. We use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and Eurodollar futures, as well as MBS and U.S. Treasuries to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. The notional amounts of the derivative &nbsp;contracts and principal value of other securities hedging the MSRs were $2.5 trillion and $31.3 billion at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;compared to $2.6 trillion and $46.3 billion at December&#160;31, 2011. In 2012, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $2.3 billion related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs compared to $6.3 billion for 2011. For additional information on MSRs, see Note 24 &#8211; Mortgage Servicing Rights&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;and for more information on mortgage banking income, see CRES&#32;on page 41.Compliance Risk ManagementCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure to comply with requirements applicable to banking and financial services laws, rules and regulations. Compliance is at the core of the Corporation's culture and is a key component of risk management discipline.The Global Compliance organization is responsible for driving a culture of compliance; establishing compliance program requirements and related policies; executing the monitoring and testing of business controls; performing risk assessments on the businesses' adherence to laws, rules and regulations as well as the effectiveness of business controls; overseeing remediation of compliance risks and issues executed by the businesses and supporting the identification, escalation and reporting of current, emerging and reputational compliance risk matters to senior management and the Board (or appropriate committee). Global Compliance is also responsible for facilitating processes to effectively manage regulatory changes and maintain constructive relationships with regulators.The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee.Operational Risk ManagementThe Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, not solely in operations functions, and its effects may extend beyond financial losses. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Global banking guidelines and country-specific requirements for managing operational risk were established in Basel 2 which requires that the Corporation has internal operational risk management processes to assess and measure operational risk exposure and to set aside appropriate capital to address those exposures.Under the advanced measurement rules of the Basel&#160;2 Framework, an operational loss event is an event that results in a loss and is associated with any of the following seven operational loss event categories: internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety; clients, products and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery and process management. Specific examples of loss events include robberies, credit card fraud, processing errors and physical losses from natural disasters.We approach operational risk management from two perspectives to manage operational risk within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business and enterprise control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. The Operational Risk Management Program incorporates the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, mitigating, controlling, monitoring, testing, reviewing operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the Board. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation's Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation's overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the Compliance and Operational Risk Committee (CORC) oversees the Corporation's policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The CORC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The CORC reports operational risk activities to the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board.Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to businesses, enterprise control functions, senior management, governance committees and the Board.Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. An annual Audit Plan ensures that coverage activities address the significant aspects of the Corporation's risk profile. Risk assessments incorporating operational risk are completed within the audit planning process. The business and enterprise control functions are responsible for managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and RCSAs, operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, mitigate and monitor risk in each business and enterprise control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data reconciliation processes; fraud management units; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The business and enterprise control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing, and monitoring adherence to, corporate practices. Business and enterprise control function management uses the enterprise RCSA process to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues, including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goals of this process are to assess changing market and business conditions, evaluate key risks impacting each business and enterprise control function and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. The RCSA process is documented at periodic intervals. Key operational risk indicators for these risks have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on an enterprise, business and enterprise control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation's overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Validation Team.&nbsp;Enterprise control functions have risk governance and control responsibilities for their enterprise programs (e.g., Global Technology and Operations Group, Chief Financial Officer Group, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs, Global Human Resources). They provide insights on day-to-day risk activities throughout the Company by overseeing and managing the performance of their functions against Company-wide expectations. The enterprise control functions participate in the operational risk management process in two ways. First, these organizations manage risk in their functional department. Second, they provide specialized risk management services (e.g., information management, vendor management) within their area of expertise to the enterprise, businesses and other enterprise control functions they support. These groups also work with business and risk executives to develop and guide appropriate strategies, policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for each business and enterprise control function relative to these programs.Additionally, where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the Corporation's Consolidated Statement of Income in the provision for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are Home Loans, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio's inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers' ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions.Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions.Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our Home Loans and Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segments, as well as our U.S. small business commercial portfolio within the Commercial portfolio segment. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our Home Loans portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;would have increased by $147&#160;million. PCI loans within our Home Loans portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $208&#160;million impairment of the portfolio, of which $99&#160;million would be related to our discontinued real estate portfolio. For each one percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and U.S. small business commercial portfolio coupled with a one percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within the portfolio segment and the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;would have increased by $60&#160;million.Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within the Commercial portfolio segment (excluding the U.S. small business commercial portfolio). Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $2.2&#160;billion at December&#160;31, 2012.&nbsp;The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December&#160;31, 2012&#32;was 2.69 percent&#32;and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 2.98&#160;percent.These sensitivity analyses do not represent management's expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote.The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions.Mortgage Servicing RightsMSRs are nonfinancial assets that are created when a mortgage loan is sold and we retain the right to service the loan. We account for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the Corporation's Consolidated Statement of Income in mortgage banking income (loss). Commercial and residential reverse mortgage MSRs are accounted for using the amortization method, lower of cost or market value, with impairment recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income (loss). At December&#160;31, 2012, our total MSR balance was $5.9 billion.We determine the fair value of our consumer MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates key economic assumptions including estimates of prepayment rates and resultant weighted-average lives of the MSRs, and the option-adjusted spread levels. These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. These assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect our operating results. For example, decreasing the prepayment rate assumption used in the valuation of our consumer MSRs by 10&#160;percent while keeping all other assumptions unchanged could have resulted in an estimated increase of $510 million&#32;in MSRs and mortgage banking income (loss) at December&#160;31, 2012. This impact does not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.We manage potential changes in the fair value of MSRs through a comprehensive risk management program. The intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of MSRs through the use of risk management instruments. To reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations, securities including MBS and U.S. Treasuries, as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs, but are not designated as accounting hedges. These instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in mortgage banking income (loss). For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management&#32;on page&#160;120.For additional information on MSRs, including the sensitivity of weighted-average lives and the fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions, see Note 24 &#8211; Mortgage Servicing Rights&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe classify the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and equity securities, certain MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain loans and loan commitments, LHFS, other short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;and Note 22 &#8211; Fair Value Option&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is tempered by the knowledge of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business.Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value based primarily on actively traded markets where prices are from either direct market quotes or observed transactions. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets and liabilities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions, or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by market perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, &nbsp;principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more of the rating agencies.Trading account profits, which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions, can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Trading account profits are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios. At a portfolio and corporate level, we use trading limits, stress testing and tools such as VaR modeling, which estimates a potential daily loss that we do not expect to exceed with a specified confidence level, to measure and manage market risk. For more information on VaR, see Trading Risk Management&#32;on page&#160;114.The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors, which are used to value the positions. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable, in which case quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for our own credit risk. The credit adjustments are determined by reference to existing direct market reference costs of credit, or where direct references are not available, a proxy is applied consistent with direct references for other counterparties that are similar in credit risk. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market implied experience adjusted for any more recent name specific expectations.Level 3 Assets and LiabilitiesFinancial assets and liabilities whose values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, CDOs and structured liabilities, as well as highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, private equity investments and consumer MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.During 2012, we recognized net gains of $136 million&#32;on Level 3 assets and liabilities. The net gains were primarily gains on trading account assets, LHFS, and loans and leases, offset by losses on MSRs, long-term debt and net derivative assets. Unrealized gains on trading account assets were primarily due to mark-to-market gains on collateralized loan obligation positions due to strong market conditions, as well as mark-to-market gains on secondary loan positions held in inventory. Unrealized gains on LHFS were due to improved market conditions for mortgage whole loans in EMEA. Unrealized gains on loans and leases were due to an overall improvement in housing prices and lower loss severity. Unrealized losses on MSRs were primarily due to the impact of the decline in interest rates on forecasted prepayments. Unrealized losses on long-term debt were the result of improved credit spreads throughout the year. Losses on net derivative assets were primarily due to tightening spreads on credit derivatives and in the RMBS indices, as well as mark-to-market movement in various equity instruments, offset by mortgage production gains. There were net unrealized gains of $65 million&#32;in accumulated OCI on Level 3 assets and liabilities at December&#160;31, 2012. For additional information on the components of net realized and unrealized gains and losses during 2012, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Level 3 financial instruments, such as our consumer MSRs, may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources.We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For additional information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2012, see Note 21 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.&nbsp;Global Principal InvestmentsGPI is included within Equity Investments in All Other&#32;on page&#160;52. GPI is comprised of a diversified portfolio of private equity, real estate and other alternative investments in both privately-held and publicly-traded companies. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund. At December&#160;31, 2012, this portfolio totaled $3.5 billion&#32;including $2.2&#160;billion of non-public investments.Certain equity investments in the portfolio are subject to investment company accounting under applicable accounting guidance, and accordingly, are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in equity investment income. Initially the transaction price of the investment is generally considered to be the best indicator of fair value. Thereafter, valuation of direct investments is based on an assessment of each individual investment using methodologies that include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying a key performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies, acquisition comparables, entry-level multiples and discounted cash flows, and are subject to appropriate discounts for lack of liquidity or marketability. Certain factors that may influence changes in fair value include but are not limited to, recapitalizations, subsequent rounds of financing and offerings in the equity or debt capital markets. For fund investments, we generally record the fair value of our proportionate interest in the fund's capital as reported by the fund's respective managers.Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax AssetsAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Corporation's Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance,&#32;in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.In applying the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies, may be material to our operating results for any given period.Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Corporation's Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized.While we have established some valuation allowances for certain state and non-U.S. deferred tax assets, we have concluded that our various estimates of future taxable income will be sufficient to realize all U.S. federal and U.K. deferred tax assets, including NOL and tax credit carryforwards, that are not subject to any special limitations (such as change-in-control limitations) prior to any expiration. The majority of our U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are realizable by subsidiaries that have a recent history of cumulative losses. These deferred tax assets related to NOLs will be realized over an extended number of years. Significant decreases to our estimates of future taxable income could materially change our conclusions about how much of our tax attributes and other deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized prior to their expiration. See Note 20 &#8211; Income Taxes&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsBackgroundThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles&#32;and Note 9 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is performed as of June&#160;30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill.We use the reporting units' allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying amount of equity for each reporting unit in our goodwill impairment tests as we do not maintain a record of equity as defined under GAAP at the reporting unit level. Allocated equity includes economic capital, goodwill and a percentage of intangible assets allocated to the reporting units. The allocation of economic capital to the reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment &nbsp;testing has the same basis as the allocation of economic capital to our operating segments. Economic capital allocation plans are incorporated into the Corporation's financial plan which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Allocated equity is updated on a quarterly basis.The Corporation's common stock price remained low during 2012 and 2011. During these periods, our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value. We estimate that the fair value of all reporting units with assigned goodwill in aggregate as of the June&#160;30, 2012&#32;annual goodwill impairment test was $219.5 billion and the aggregate carrying value of all reporting units with assigned goodwill, as measured by allocated equity was $138.4 billion. The common stock market capitalization of the Corporation at June 30, 2012&#32;was $88.2 billion&#32;($125.1 billion&#32;at December&#160;31, 2012). As none of our reporting units are publicly-traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly correlate to the Corporation's stock price. Although we believe it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units.Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and also utilized independent valuation specialists.The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the tangible capital, book capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to that of the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, we added a control premium to arrive at the reporting units' estimated fair values on a controlling basis.For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for similar industries of each reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results.In 2012, the IWM businesses within GWIM, including $230 million&#32;of goodwill, were moved to All Other&#32;in connection with the agreement we entered into during 2012 to sell these businesses. Prior periods have been reclassified. 2012&#32;Annual Impairment Test During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June&#160;30, 2012&#32;for all of our reporting units which had goodwill. Additionally, we also evaluated the U.K. Card business within All Other as the U.K. Card business comprises the majority of the goodwill included in All Other. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, including goodwill. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premium used in the June&#160;30, 2012&#32;annual goodwill impairment test was 35 percent for all reporting units. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June&#160;30, 2012&#32;annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 11 percent to 14 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Growth rates developed by management for individual revenue and expense items in each reporting unit ranged from (0.2) percent to 7.2 percent. For certain revenue and expense items that have been significantly affected by the current economic environment, management developed separate long-term forecasts. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their respective fair values exceeded their carrying values indicating there was no impairment. 2011&#32;Impairment TestsDuring the three months ended December 31, 2011, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the European consumer cardbusinesses reporting unit within All Other&#32;as it was likely that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value due to a decrease in estimated future growth projections. We concluded that goodwill was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $581 million.During the three months ended June 30, 2011, as a consequence of the BNY Mellon Settlement entered into by the Corporation on June 28, 2011, the adverse impact of the incremental mortgage-related charges and the continued economic slowdown in the mortgage business, we performed a goodwill impairment test for the CRES&#32;reporting unit. We concluded &nbsp;that the remaining balance of goodwill of $2.6 billion&#32;was impaired, and accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill in CRES&#32;to zero.Representations and WarrantiesThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan. It also considers other relevant facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of counterparty, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability.The representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests, and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10&#160;percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately $850 million&#32;or decrease of approximately $750 million&#32;in the representations and warranties liability as of December&#160;31, 2012, excluding amounts related to the FNMA Settlement. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.For additional information on representations and warranties exposure and the corresponding range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations &#8211; Representations and Warranties&#32;on page 54, as well as Note 8 &#8211; Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees&#32;and Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Litigation ReserveIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. As a litigation or regulatory matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and estimable. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, we are able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, the estimated range of possible loss represents what we believe to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure. Information is provided in Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies&#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#32;regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies.&nbsp;Consolidation and Accounting for Variable Interest EntitiesIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, an entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The Corporation is deemed to have a controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.Determining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment. An entity must assess the purpose and design of the VIE, including explicit and implicit contractual arrangements, and the entity's involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. The entity must then determine which activities have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the VIE and whether the entity has the power to direct such activities. For VIEs that hold financial assets, the party that services the assets or makes investment management decisions may have the power to direct the most significant activities of a VIE. Alternatively, a third party that has the unilateral right to replace the servicer or investment manager or to liquidate the VIE may be deemed to be the party with power. If there are no significant ongoing activities, the party that was responsible for the design of the VIE may be deemed to have power. If the entity determines that it has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE, then the entity must determine if it has either an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such economic interests may include investments in debt or equity instruments issued by the VIE, liquidity commitments, and explicit and implicit guarantees.On a quarterly basis, we reassess whether we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The quarterly reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. The reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the VIE, or whether an interest in the VIE has become significant or is no longer significant. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments. Changes in consolidation status are applied prospectively, with assets and liabilities of a newly consolidated VIE initially recorded at fair value. A gain or loss may be recognized upon deconsolidation of a VIE depending on the carrying amounts of deconsolidated assets and liabilities compared to the fair value of retained interests and ongoing contractual arrangements.2011 Compared to 2010The following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of our results of operations for 2011&#32;and 2010. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Tables 7&#32;and 8&#32;contain financial data to supplement this discussion.OverviewNet Income (Loss)Net income was $1.4 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to a net loss of $2.2 billion&#32;in 2010. Including preferred stock dividends, the net income applicable to common shareholders was $85 million, or $0.01&#32;per diluted share. Those results compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $3.6 billion, or $0.37&#32;per diluted share for 2010.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income on a FTE basis was $45.6 billion&#32;for 2011, a decrease of $7.1 billion compared to 2010. The decline was primarily due to lower consumer loan balances and yields and decreased investment security yields, including the acceleration of purchase premium amortization from an increase in modeled prepayment expectations, and increased hedge ineffectiveness. Lower trading-related net interest income also negatively impacted 2011&#32;results. These decreases were partially offset by ongoing reductions in our debt footprint and lower interest rates paid on deposits. The net interest yield on a FTE basis was 2.48 percent&#32;for 2011, a decrease of 30 bps compared to 2010&#32;as the yield continued to be under pressure due to the aforementioned items and the low rate environment.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income was $48.8 billion&#32;in 2011, a decrease of $9.9 billion&#32;compared to 2010. &nbsp;Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $13.4 billion&#32;for 2011, a decrease of $15.0 billion&#32;compared to 2010. The provision for credit losses was $7.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for 2011, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses primarily driven by lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios, and improvement in overall credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by additions to consumer PCI loan portfolio reserves. This compared to a $5.9 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses in 2010. Net charge-offs totaled $20.8 billion, or 2.24 percent of average loans and leases for 2011&#32;compared to $34.3 billion, or 3.60 percent for 2010. The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by improvements in general economic conditions that resulted in lower delinquencies, improved collection rates and fewer bankruptcy filings across the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios, as well as lower losses in the home equity portfolio primarily driven by fewer delinquent loans.Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense was $80.3 billion&#32;for 2011, a decrease of $2.8 billion&#32;compared to 2010. Goodwill impairment charges were $3.2 billion&#32;for 2011&#32;compared to $12.4 billion in the prior year. Personnel expense increased $1.8 billion for 2011 attributable to personnel costs related to the continued build-out of certain businesses, technology costs as well as increases in default-related servicing. Additionally, professional fees increased $686 million related to consulting fees for regulatory initiatives as well as higher legal expenses. Other general operating expenses increased $4.9 billion largely as a result of a $3.0 billion increase in litigation expense, primarily mortgage-related, and an increase of $1.6 billion in mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs. Merger and restructuring expenses decreased $1.2 billion in 2011.Income Tax ExpenseThe income tax benefit was $1.7 billion&#32;on the pre-tax loss of $230 million&#32;for 2011&#32;compared to income tax expense of $915 million&#32;on the pre-tax loss of $1.3 billion&#32;for 2010. These amounts are before FTE adjustments. The income tax benefit for 2011 was driven by recurring tax preference items, a $1.0 billion benefit from the release of the remaining valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, and a benefit of $823 million for planned realization of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the tax basis in certain subsidiaries. These benefits were partially offset by the $782 million tax charge related to the enactment of a two percent reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2010 excluding goodwill impairment charges was 8.3 percent. In addition to our recurring tax preference items, this rate was driven by a $1.7 billion benefit from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance applicable to the Merrill Lynch capital loss carryover deferred tax asset, partially offset by the $392 million charge from a one percent reduction to the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during 2010.Business Segment OperationsConsumer & Business BankingCBB&#32;recorded net income of $7.4 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to a net loss of $5.1 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;primarily due to a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2010 and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by lower average loan balances and yields, lower service charges reflecting the impact of overdraft policy changes in conjunction with Regulation E that were fully implemented during the third quarter of 2010, the implementation of the Durbin Amendment in the fourth quarter of 2011, the gain on the sale of our MasterCard position in 2010 and the implementation of the CARD Act. The provision for credit losses decreased $8.2 billion&#32;to $3.5 billion&#32;reflecting improving economic conditions and lower loan balances. Noninterest expense decreased $10.9 billion&#32;to $17.7 billion&#32;primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge in 2010 and lower litigation and operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in FDIC expense.Consumer Real Estate ServicesCRES recorded a net loss of $19.5 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to $8.9 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;primarily due to an increase in representations and warranties provision, lower core production income, a decrease in insurance income due to the sale of Balboa in 2011, and an increase in noninterest expense. Mortgage banking income declined driven by the increased representations and warranties provision and lower core production income due to a drop in market share combined with the decline in the overall market demand for mortgages in 2011. The provision for credit losses decreased $4.0 billion&#32;to $4.5 billion&#32;primarily driven by improving portfolio trends, including lower reserve additions in the Countrywide PCI home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $7.0 billion&#32;to $21.8 billion&#32;due to higher litigation expense, increased mortgage-related assessments and waivers costs, higher default-related and other loss mitigation expenses and a higher goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower insurance and production expenses.Global BankingGlobal Banking&#32;recorded net income of $6.0 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to $4.9 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower revenue. Revenue decreased $432 million&#32;to $17.3 billion&#32;primarily driven by lower net interest income related to ALM activities and lower accretion on acquired portfolios, partially offset by the impact of higher &nbsp;average loan and deposit balances. The provision for credit losses improved $2.4 billion&#32;to a benefit of $1.1 billion&#32;driven by the positive impact of the economic environment on the credit portfolio and an accelerated rate of loan resolutions in the commercial real estate portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $215 million&#32;to $8.9 billion&#32;as higher FDIC expense was partially offset by lower personnel and occupancy expenses.Global MarketsGlobal Markets&#32;recorded net income of $1.0 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to $4.3 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;driven by a decline in sales and trading revenue due to a challenging market environment, partially offset by net DVA gains. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, was $11.8 billion in 2011&#32;compared to $16.4 billion in 2010. Noninterest expense increased $470 million&#32;to $12.2 billion&#32;primarily driven by increased costs related to investments in infrastructure. Income tax expense included a $774 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as a result of a reduction in the U.K. corporate income tax rate enacted during 2011 compared to a charge of $388 million for a rate reduction enacted in 2010.Global Wealth & Investment ManagementGWIM&#32;recorded net income of $1.7 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to $1.3 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;driven by higher asset management fees, higher net interest income and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $338 million&#32;to $5.9 billion&#32;as the impact of higher average deposit balances more than offset the impact of a lower rate environment. Noninterest income increased $774 million&#32;to $10.6 billion&#32;primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by higher average markets levels in 2011 compared to 2010 and continued long-term AUM flows. The provision for credit losses decreased $248 million&#32;to $398 million&#32;driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense increased $1.1 billion&#32;to $13.4 billion&#32;due primarily to higher volume-driven expenses and personnel costs associated with the continued investment in the business.All OtherAll Other&#32;recorded net income of $4.7 billion&#32;in 2011&#32;compared to $1.3 billion&#32;in 2010&#32;primarily due to higher noninterest income and lower merger and restructuring charges. Noninterest income increased $7.3 billion&#32;to $14.1 billion&#32;due to positive fair value adjustments related to our own credit spreads on structured liabilities of $3.3 billion in 2011 compared to $18 million in 2010. Equity investment income increased $2.5 billion as a result of a $6.5 billion gain from the sale of CCB shares partially offset by $1.1 billion of impairment charges on our merchant services joint venture and a decrease of $1.9 billion in GPI income. A goodwill impairment charge of $581 million was recorded during 2011 as a result of a change in the estimated value of the European consumer card business. The prior year included $1.2 billion of gains on the sales of certain strategic investments. The provision for credit losses decreased $152 million&#32;to $6.2 billion&#32;primarily due to divestitures, improvements in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio and run-off, partially offset by the impact of a continuing decline in home prices.Statistical Tablesn/m = not meaningfulFor footnotes see page 140.For footnotes see page&#160;142.n/m = not meaningful<hr
