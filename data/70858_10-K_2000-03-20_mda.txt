Unless otherwise specified on the face of the Note and in an applicable Pricing Supplement, in the case of Floating Rate Notes, interest will be calculated and paid on the basis of the actual number of days since the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, since the Original Issue Date) divided by 360 or, if the base rate is the Treasury Rate or CMT Rate, as defined in the applicable Note, by the actual number of days since the preceding Interest Payment Date (or, if none, since the Original Issue Date) . All interest on Certificated Notes (other than interest payable at Stated Maturity or upon any Optional Redemption) will be paid by check of the Issuing and Paying Agent mailed by such Issuing and Paying Agent to the Holder as such Holders address is shown in the Register referred to in Section 15 on the applicable Regular Record Date, or to such other address in the United States as such Holder shall designate to the Issuing and Paying Agent in writing not later than the relevant Regular Record Date; provided, however, that a Holder of one million dollars ($1,000,000) or more in aggregate Principal amount of Certificated Notes (all of which have identical terms and tenor) shall be entitled to receive payments of interest (other than interest payable at maturity or upon redemption) by wire transfer of immediately available funds upon written request to the Issuing and Paying Agent not later than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the applicable Payment Date.
