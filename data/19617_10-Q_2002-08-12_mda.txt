Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2Financial Highlights &#150; Reported Basis: Reported net income was $1,028&nbsp;million,or $0.50 per share, in the second quarter of 2002 compared with $982&nbsp;million,or $0.48 per share, in the first quarter of 2002 and $378&nbsp;million, or $0.18 pershare, in the second quarter of2001. For the first six months of 2002, reported net income was $2,010&nbsp;million,or $0.99 per share, compared with $1,577&nbsp;million, or $0.76 per share, in thesame period last year.Total revenue of $7.6&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2002 was flat versus theimmediately preceding quarter but 9% above the second quarter of last year. Thecurrent quarter reflected the strong results of the retail business,particularly the mortgage businesses, and lower losses on private equityinvestments. These were partially offset by a decline in trading revenue drivenby lower positioning gains taken in fixed income, primarily in emerging marketsand U.S. interest rate markets, in the latter part of the quarter and lowerinvestment banking fees as a result of lower market volumes. In comparison withthe second quarter of last year, the increase of 9% was principallyattributable to the significant improvement in the results of the privateequity investments. Last year included larger write-downs on several technology,media and telecommunications investments.For the first half of 2002, total revenue of$15.2&nbsp;billion was comparatively flatwith last year's year-to-date level. The decline in trading revenue andinvestment banking fees was offset by reductions in private equitylosses and strong results of the retail business.Total noninterest expenses of $5.2&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2002declined from both comparable periods. The decline of 3% from the 2002 firstquarter was due to lower incentives related to the decrease in revenues, andthe cost of the first quarter settlement with Sumitomo Corporation. The decline of 11%from the second quarter of last year was attributable to lower compensationexpense as a result of merger-related savings, as well as the implementation of expense management initiatives,which included the right-sizing of resources in response to lower marketactivity. In addition, the current quarter reflected lower merger andrestructuring expenses and the effect of the adoption of SFAS 142, whichreduced the amortization of intangibles.On a year-to-date basis, total expense of $10.6&nbsp;billion in 2002 was 11% lowerthan last year, reflecting the expense management initiatives, lower merger andrestructuring costs and cessation of amortization of goodwill.Provision for loan losses for the 2002 second quarter was up 9% from the firstquarter of this year and 56% above the second quarter of 2001. The increasefrom a year ago resulted from the slowdown in the economy, which unfavorably affected both thecommercial and consumer loan portfolios. In addition, the increases from bothperiods were affected by the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust inFebruary 2002. For the first half this year, the provision of $1.6&nbsp;billion was62% higher than last year's equivalent period, reflecting the impact of theslowdown in the economy and the Providian acquisition.19 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Summary of Segment ResultsIn addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis managementutilizes &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of its businesses. For additionalinformation and a reconciliation between the Firm's reported and operatingresults see pages 26-27 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.Operating results for the 2002 second quarter werecomparable with the 2002 firstquarter. Operating earnings were $1,179&nbsp;million in the second quarter 2002,compared with $1,150&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002 and $786&nbsp;million oneyear ago. Operating earnings for 2001 have been increased by adding backamortization of goodwill to present 2001 results on a basiscomparable with theresults for 2002, which include the impact of the implementation on January&nbsp;1,2002 of SFAS 142. Positives for the quarter included:Nevertheless, the weak capital markets environment negatively affected, invarying degrees, many of the Firm's segments. Operating revenues at theInvestment Bank, at $3.1&nbsp;billion, were 14% lower than the 2002 first quarterand 17% lower than the 2001 second quarter. Operating revenues at InvestmentManagement & Private Banking were 5% lower than the 2002 first quarter and 12%lower than the second quarter of 2001 primarily as a result of continueddeclines in global equity markets valuations and lower investment activitylevels. JPMorgan Partners had a private equity loss of $125&nbsp;million, reflectinglimited exit opportunities, constrained availability for financing and aprivate equity market that continues to be unsettled.Looking forward, the current crisis in confidenceamong investors suggests a decline in market activity in the second half of the year, leadingto continued pressure on revenues and credit costs. Revenues at Retail & MiddleMarket Financial Services may be lower in the remaining quarters of the yearthan the second quarter because of the strong hedge gains recognizedin the 2002 second quarter on mortgage servicing rights(&#147;MSR&#148;). Sluggish M&A, equity underwriting and overall tradingopportunities will continue to affect negatively revenues at the InvestmentBank. Continuingpressures in the commercial portfolio, particularly in thetelecommunications (&#147;telecom&#148;) and cablesegments of that portfolio, may cause commercial credit costs and nonperformingassets to increase further during the latter half of the year. Theanticipated improvement in the consumer credit portfolio maypartially offset the anticipated higher credit costs in thecommercial portfolio.In this environment, strong financial and capital discipline will remain apriority of the Firm. The Tier 1 capital ratio at June&nbsp;30, 2002was 8.8%,compared with 8.3% at December&nbsp;31, 2001. Management does not intend to resumestock repurchases until earnings of the Firm improve and generation of internalcapital accelerates. Expense discipline is ongoing and management continues totarget operatingexpenses for full year 2002 to be lower than full year 2001. Managementcontinues to believe these actions will enable the Firm to produce higherreturns when the economy recovers.20 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results of operations on a reported basis.Investment Banking FeesInvestment banking fees of $785&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 declined16% from the 2001 second quarter but increased slightly from the first quarterof 2002. The decline was principally attributable to the continuing weakness inthe capital markets, especially mergers and acquisitions. Advisory revenues inthe second quarter of 2002 were $189&nbsp;million, a decline of 39% from the secondquarter of 2001. Market share gains in equity underwriting increasedunderwriting revenue although equity underwriting volumes remained at depressedlevels. The market environment also unfavorably affected, to a lesser extent,the volume of debt underwriting and loan syndication transactions in 2002, withfees related to these activities declining slightly from last year.Capital markets continue to be weak and there continues to be a low level ofdeals in the pipeline. (For additional information on investment banking fees,see the Investment Bank segment discussion on page 29.)Trading RevenueIn the second quarter of 2002, trading revenue of $731&nbsp;million declined 42%from 2001 second quarter and 44% from first quarter of this year. The declinesfrom both periods reflected lower positioning gains taken in fixedincome, primarily in emerging markets and U.S.interest rate markets, and lower equity derivative trading revenuescompared withthe second quarter of 2001 driven by difficult market conditions. As moreNasdaq-market trades are effected in 2002 on a commission basis (rather thanbased on the bid/offer spread), more of the revenues derived from suchtrades will be recorded in Brokerage and investment services (ratherthan in Tradingrevenues, as had been previously).Difficult market conditions in both fixed income and equities have continuedinto the early part of the third quarter, resulting in an overall lower tradingrevenue environment compared with the second quarter.21 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Fees and CommissionsFees and commissions for second quarter 2002 increased 17% and 12% from thesecond quarter 2001 and the first quarter 2002, respectively. The table belowprovides the significant components of fees and commissions.Investment Management, Custody and Processing ServicesInvestment management, custody and processing services fees were relativelyflat when compared with both the second quarter of last year and the firstquarter of 2002. Investment management fees declined from the 2002 firstquarter as a result of the decrease in the value of equity-related assets undermanagement. The decline ininvestment management fees was partly offset by positiveretail mutual fund flows. Custody and processingservices increased slightly from the first quarter of 2002 due to new businesswins and higher securities lending volume, partly related to the traditionalincrease in business volume during the second quarter dividend season, which isdriven by overseas companies paying annual or semi-annual dividends. (Foradditional information on these fees, see the Investment Management & PrivateBanking and the Treasury & Securities Services segmentdiscussions on pages&nbsp;33 and 30, respectively.)Credit Card RevenueCredit card revenue rose 44% from the second quarter of 2001 and 14% from thefirst quarter of 2002. The increase over the 2001 second quarter primarilyreflected the increase in securitization revenues related to theadditional $9billion of average securitized assets, including the Providian Master Trustassets acquired in February 2002. Also contributing to theincrease from last year was higher balance consolidation fees benefitting fromthe more active marketing programs. In comparison with the first quarter of2002, the increase was driven by the higher securitization revenues as a resultof the additional $4&nbsp;billion of average securitized assets in the second quarter, aswell as the full-quarter impact of Providian. For a discussion of thetreatment of the accounting for securitizations, see page 26.Brokerage and Investment ServicesIn the second quarter of 2002, brokerage and investment services rose 8% and10% from the 2001 second quarter and the 2002 first quarter, respectively. Theincreases included the impact of more Nasdaq-market trades being effected, in2002 on a commission basis (rather than based on the bid/offer spread). The increases alsoreflected the reclassification of certain commissions that were previouslyrecorded in trading revenue.Mortgage Servicing FeesMortgage Servicing fees of $257&nbsp;million in the 2002 second quarter increasedsignificantly from both the 2001 second quarter and the first quarter of thisyear principally due to the net positive results of servicing riskmanagement activities relating to the hedging of the value ofmortgage servicing rights recorded on the balance sheet. The currentquarter net positive results from servicing risk management weredriven by very high mortgage-swap spreads and a favorable interestrate environment. At June&nbsp;30, 2002, the volume of mortgages serviced at HomeFinance stood at $436&nbsp;billion compared with $409&nbsp;billion at the same periodlast year and $426&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002.The Firm offsets its mortgage servicing right interest rate (prepayment)&nbsp;riskexposure by designating certain interest rate derivatives as fair value hedges.The results of these hedges and the adjustments of the carrying value of theMSRs under SFAS 133 are recorded in mortgage servicing fees. The results ofthese fair value hedges more than offset the SFAS 133 MSR valuation adjustment.AFS securities and nonhedge derivatives are also used to manage the riskexposure of the MSRs (for a further discussion see Note 9 onpage 14).22 Table of ContentsItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Other Lending-Related Service FeesOther lending-related fees in the second quarter of 2002 were up 5% from thesecond quarter of 2001 primarily due to the growth in the auto loan servicingvolume at Auto Finance.Deposit Service ChargesDeposit service charges in the second quarter of 2002 increased 6% from thesecond quarter of 2001, and declined 6% from the first quarter of 2002. Theincrease was driven by the impact of lower interest rates, which reduced thevalue of compensating deposit balances and increased the fees customers pay fordeposit services. The decrease from first quarter of 2002 reflected lower accountactivities. On a year-to-date basis, the increase of 16% from last year wasdriven by lower interest rates, as well as by higher transaction volume.Other FeesOther fees of $244&nbsp;million in the 2002 second quarter were flat from lastyear's second quarter but increased 5% from the 2002 first quarter. The currentquarter included the full-quarter impact of the credit card-related debtmanagement fees of the Providian Master Trust and the servicing fees associatedwith Systems & Services Technology (a company engaged in subservicingactivities acquired in January 2002 by Institutional Trust Services). Thesefees were partly offset by lower insurance commissions and volume declines invarious other processing transaction businesses.Private Equity GainsPrivate equity investments of the Firm recorded losses of $125&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2002, an improvement of 85% from the second quarter of lastyear and 47% from the first quarter of 2002.The recovery in private equity investment gains will be dependent upon thereturn to more favorable conditions for exiting investments. The currentoutlook for the second half of the year is for the continuation of the currentmarket environment, with initial public offerings and high-yieldfinancing still at minimum levels, mergers and acquisitions activityslow and continued write-downs in the telecommunications, media andtelecom sectors (&#147;TMT&#148;). (For a further discussion of the Firm's private equity results, see theJPMP line of business results on page 34 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.) The table belowprovides a comparison to prior periods of realized and unrealized gains andlosses.Securities GainsSecurities gains of $124&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 were up 85% fromthe 2001 second quarter. The increase reflected gains on sales ofmortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities in the portfolios of theInvestment Bank and Home Finance.The decline from last year on a year-to-date basis primarily reflected lastyear's $315&nbsp;million gain on the sale of securities that were used as economichedges for the value of mortgage servicing rights at Home Finance.During the firsthalf of 2001, the value of the available-for-sale securities in theportfolio of Home Finance rose substantially as a result of declining ratesduring that period.23 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2&nbsp;(continued)The net gains of $146&nbsp;million on residential mortgage originations, sales andsecuritizations of loans in the second quarter of 2002 declinedslightlycompared with second quarter of 2001 but rose 46% from the firstquarter of 2002.Revenue for the six months 2002 declined slightly as a result of the lowervolume of subprime loan securitizations, partially offset by higher gains onsales of prime loans and the effect of strong originations. (For additionalinformation on mortgage-related revenue, see the Retail & Middle MarketFinancial Services segment discussion on page 31 and Note 8 on page 12.)The decline in gains of securitized mortgage loans, despite the higher amountof mortgage loans securitized during the first six months of 2002 when comparedto the same period in 2001 (as noted in Note 8 on page 12), is primarily due tothe composition of mortgage securitizations. The first six months of 2002, whencompared to the same period in 2001, included a higher volume of primesecuritizations, which generally have a lower margin of gain than subprimemortgage securitizations. In addition, the subprime loans securitized in 2002had a higher cost basis than the subprime loans securitized in 2001.All other revenue of $146&nbsp;million increased moderately from the second quarterof 2001 but was up 156% from the first quarter this year. The second quarter of2002 reflected an increase in the net results of the corporate and bank-ownedlife insurance (COLI/BOLI). These insurance policies are purchased by the Firmfor the purpose of partially defraying the costs of employee benefits andeconomically hedging deferred compensation costs. Also contributing to theincrease in other revenue from the first quarter were the gains on the highervolume of securitizations of credit card receivables and commercial real estateloans, as well as write-downs in the 2002 first quarter of Latin Americaninvestments. The year-to-date decline of 26% from last year was primarilyattributable to gains recognized in 2001 on the sale of several nonstrategicbusinesses in Texas and retail properties in New York.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income of $2.9&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2002 rose slightlyfrom the 2001 second quarter, and the $5.8&nbsp;billion of net interest income forthe first half of 2002 increased 12% from the equivalent period a year ago,reflecting the favorable impact of low interest rates and widerspreads. The low interest rateenvironment contributed to an increase in domestic consumer loans, such ascredit card receivables and auto loans; also contributing to increasedoutstandings was the acquisition of the Providian portfolio in February of2002.NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal noninterest expense for the quarter was $5.2&nbsp;billion, down 11% from thesecond quarter of 2001 and slightly below the first quarter of this year. Thedecline from the 2001 second quarter was due to merger-relatedsavings and expense management initiativesimplemented in response to the weak market environment, including lowercompensation expense. Also contributing to the decline was the cessation of theamortization of goodwill as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 and lowermerger and restructuring costs related to actions announced before 2002. Thesefactors were partially offset by incremental expenses related to the Providianacquisition and additional severance costs included in Compensationexpense in 2002. The following table presents the components of noninterestexpense.Compensation ExpenseCompensation expense in the second quarter of 2002 was $2.8&nbsp;billion, down 9%from last year's second quarter and slightly lower than the 2002 first quarter.The declines were the result of the alignment of incentives with the decreasein revenues, as well as the reduction in the number of full-time equivalentemployees in businesses affected by the downturn in the economy, particularlythe Investment Bank and Investment Management & Private Banking. This was partially offset by the impact of annual salaryraises and new employees at expanding business segments, primarily atRetail & Middle Market Financial Services. Compensation expense in 2002 included severance costs of $97&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter and $67&nbsp;million in the first quarter. (In 2001, severance costsassociated with the merger and other previously announced restructuringprograms were recorded within the restructuring line and not in Compensationexpense.)24 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The Firm had 95,878 full-time equivalent employees at June&nbsp;30, 2002, comparedwith 97,224 at June&nbsp;30, 2001 and 96,938 at March&nbsp;31, 2002. The decline in thenumber of employees was attributable to reductions at the Investment Bank,Investment Management & Private Banking and Corporate and Support business segments, partiallyoffset increases at Retail & Middle Market Financial Services and Treasury &Securities Services.Occupancy ExpenseOccupancy expense in the 2002 second quarter rose 12% from the second quarterof 2001 and 8% from the first quarter of this year. The increases reflected thecosts of the additional leased space in midtown Manhattan and New Jersey. Inthe second quarter of this year, certain staff that had been previously locatedin downtown Manhattan were relocated to these new locations. These costs were partlyoffset by the income received from subletting space at a property owned indowntown Manhattan.Technology and Communications ExpenseIn the second quarter of 2002, technology and communications expense of $629million declined from the first quarter of this year and the 2001 secondquarter. Expense management initiatives resulted in lower software andtelecommunication expenses and lower other technology and equipment-relatedexpenses, such as those associated with workstation leases and repair andmaintenance. Also contributing to the decline were rebates received fromoutside vendors based on the volume of business sourced from them.Merger and Restructuring CostsIn the second quarter of 2002, merger and restructuring costs were $229million, down 52% from the 2001 second quarter, and 10% lower than the firstquarter of this year. Refer to the discussion of Compensation Expense above fora description of other severance costs incurred in 2002 and to Note 5 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q and page 44 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001Annual Report.Amortization of IntangiblesAmortization of intangibles of $92&nbsp;million included a $12&nbsp;million impairmentwrite-down on purchased credit card relationships related to a small creditcard portfolio previously acquired. Amortization of intangibles declined 50%from last year's second quarter but was 33% higher than the 2002 first quarter.The decline from last year primarily reflected the implementation of SFAS 142,which now requires a periodic review of goodwill for impairment rather than theamortization of goodwill on a monthly basis as was the case last year. In 2002,there were no impairments recognized on goodwill recorded on the balance sheet.The increase from the first quarter was attributable to the amortization ofProvidian Master Trust's credit card relationship intangibles. (For a furtherdiscussion of the amortization of intangibles and the expected level of expensefor the remainder of the year, see Note 2 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.)Other ExpenseIn the second quarter of 2002, other expense was down slightly from each of the 2001 second quarter and the first quarterof this year. The following table presents the components of other expense.25 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSESProvision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2002, when compared with thesecond quarter of 2001, increased 56% partly as a result of the addition ofProvidian. (See pages 38-43 for a discussion of charge-offs associated with theconsumer and commercial loan portfolios and pages 43-44 for a discussion of theallowance for credit losses.)INCOME TAXESIn the second quarter of 2002, JPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of$531&nbsp;million, compared with $207&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2001. Theeffective tax rates for the periods were 34% and 35%, respectively.SEGMENT RESULTSThe Firm prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The primary financial statements prepared inaccordance with GAAP appear on pages 3-6 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q. That presentation,which is referred to as &#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the reader with anunderstanding of the Firm's results that can be consistently tracked from yearto year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with othercompanies' GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementutilizes &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of its businesses and to measureoverall Firm results against targeted goals. The definition of operating basisstarts with the reported GAAP results and then excludes the impact of mergerand restructuring costs and special items, which usually are significantnonrecurring gains or losses. Management generally defines &#147;special items&#148; asnonrecurring revenue or expense events of $50&nbsp;million or more. Bothrestructuring charges and special items are viewed by management astransactions that are not part of the Firm's normal daily business operationsor are unusual in nature and are therefore not indicative of trends. Operatingresults in 2002 include the severance and related costs associated withmanagement actions in light of slower market activity. For the second quarterand first six months of 2002, special items included $229&nbsp;million and $484million (pre-tax), respectively, in merger and restructuring expenses. For thesecond quarter and first six months of 2001, special items included $478million and $806&nbsp;million (pre-tax), respectively, in merger and restructuringexpenses. The first six months of 2001 also included the cumulative effect of atransition adjustment of $(25) million (after-tax) related to the adoption ofSFAS 133.Operating results also exclude the impact of credit card securitizations.JPMorgan Chase periodically securitizes a portion of its credit card portfolioby selling a pool of credit card receivables to a trust, which issuessecurities to investors. When credit card receivables are securitized, the Firmceases to accrue interest and credit costs on the receivables and, instead,receives fee revenue for continuing to service those receivables and feerevenue representing any interest and fees on the receivables in excess of theinterest paid to investors, net credit losses and servicing fees. As a result,securitization does not affect JPMorgan Chase's reported or operating netincome; however, it doesaffect the classification of items in the Consolidated statement of income. TheFirm also reports credit costs on a &#147;retained&#148; or &#147;reported&#148; basis and on a&#147;managed&#148; or &#147;operating&#148; basis. Credit costs on an operating basis are composedof the provision for loan losses related to credit card receivables on theconsolidated balance sheet (&#147;retained&#148; credit costs) as well as the creditcosts associated with securitized credit card loans. Credit costs forsecuritized loans are for the account of the Firm as the holder of the residualinterest in the securitization trust. In the Firm's GAAP financial statements,credit costs associated with securitized credit card loans reduces thenoninterest income remitted to the Firm from the trust. This income is reportedin credit card revenue in Fees and Commissions over the life of thesecuritization.In 2001, the methodology for allocating the allowance (and provision) for loan losses to thebusiness segments was changed. The Firm currently has a methodology where each business is responsiblefor its credit costs, which will include actual net charge-offs and changes inthe specific and expected components of the allowance for loan losses. Minor refinements to the allocationof the allowance are continuing in 2002. The residual component of the allowance for loan losses is maintained at the corporate level.26 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following summary table provides a reconciliation between the Firm's reported and operating results.(in millions)27 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's segment results reflect the manner in which financialinformation currently is evaluated by the Firm's management. Adjustments may bemade from time to time to reflect changes in methodologies or reporting lines.For a discussion of the Firm's methodology of allocating equity to its businessunits, see page 29 of the 2001 Annual Report. The table below provides summaryfinancial information on an operating basis for the five major businesssegments.28 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the Investment Bank, see pages30-31 of the JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of the Investment Bank.The Investment Bank had operating earnings of $485&nbsp;million in the secondquarter, a decline of 35% from the first quarter and 38% lower than the secondquarter of 2001. Operating ROE was 10% for the quarter compared with 16% lastquarter and 17% for the second quarter of 2001.Operating revenues of $3.09&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2002 were 14%lower than last quarter and down 17% from the second quarter of 2001.Trading-related revenues (including related net interest income) and brokeragecommissions of $1.41&nbsp;billion decreased 28% from the first quarter and were down23% from the second quarter of 2001. The decline from the first quarter wasdriven largely by fixed income results, particularly lower proprietarypositioning gains in U.S. interest rate markets and emerging marketinstruments. The decline from the second quarter of 2001 was primarily due tolower equity derivatives revenues driven by difficult market conditions.Difficult market conditions in both fixed income and equities have continuedinto the early part of the third quarter resulting in an overall lower tradingrevenue environment compared to the second quarter.Investment banking fees totaled $783&nbsp;million in the second quarter, an increaseof 6% from the first quarter but 15% lower than the second quarter of 2001. Theincrease from the first quarter reflected a 33% increase in equity underwritingfees and flat M&A fees and debt underwriting revenues. Market share gains inthe second quarter included global announced M&A (#1), U.S. and global equityand equity-related (#6), U.S. investment grade bonds (#2) and global loan syndications(#1). (Derived from Thomson Financial Securities Data. Global announced M&Abased on rank value; all others based on proceeds, with full credit to eachbook manager/equal if joint). Capital markets continue to be weak and therecontinues to be a low level of deals in the pipeline.All other revenue of $148&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 was 90% higherthan the prior linked quarter primarily reflecting the write-downs of LatinAmerican investments recognized in the first quarter.29 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expenses for the second quarter of $2.02&nbsp;billion decreased by 4% fromthe first quarter and by 11% from the second quarter of 2001. Operatingexpenses in the second quarter included $123&nbsp;million in severance and othercosts associated with restructuring programs announced in 2002. This comparedwith $47&nbsp;million of such costs in the first quarter. The overhead ratio for thesecond quarter was 65% compared to 58% in the first quarter and 61% in thesecond quarter of 2001.Credit costs of $306&nbsp;million were 9% higher than the first quarter and were 83%higher than the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to increased charge-offs and higher specific reserves,most of which related to the telecom services sector. For a furtherdiscussion of the telecom sector, see page&nbsp;38.TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;T&SS&#148;), see pages 32-33 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report. Thefollowing table sets forth selected financial data of Treasury & SecuritiesServices.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.Treasury & Securities Services had record operating earnings of $177&nbsp;million,an increase of 22% from the first quarter and 16% from the second quarter of2001, underscored by the implementation of strict cost containment measures.Operating ROE for the quarter was 23% compared with 20% in each of the lastquarter and the second quarter of 2001, while SVA rose sharply, up 50% and 40%over the same time periods respectively.Operating revenues were $985&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002, up 5% fromthe first quarter and up 2% from the second quarter of 2001. Revenues inInvestor Services were up 9% from the first quarter and were virtually flatcompared with the second quarter of 2001. The increase from the first quarter wasdue to higher custody fees, foreign exchange revenue and securities lendingfees. Institutional Trust revenues increased 9% from the first quarter of 2002due to higher American Depositary Receipt revenues and new business. The 12%increase in Institutional Trust revenues from the second quarter of 2001reflected the impact of acquisitions and new business wins partially offset bythe effect of slower fixed income activity. The impact of lower interest rateson Treasury & Securities Services revenues was largely offset by higherdeposits resulting from increased business volumes.30 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expenses were virtually unchanged from the first quarter and declined2% from the second quarter of 2001. The business, particularly TreasuryServices and Investor Services, continues to focus on cost containment andimproving its overhead ratio, while selectively investing in acquisitions forfuture growth. The overhead ratio for the second quarter was 72% compared to76% in each of the first quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2001.RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of Retail & Middle Market Financial Services (&#147;RMMFS&#148;) and adiscussion of the profiles for each business, see pages 38-40 of JPMorganChase's 2001 Annual Report. The following table reflects selected financialdata for RMMFS.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.Retail & Middle Market Financial Services had a second consecutive quarter ofrecord revenues and operating earnings. Operating earnings of $686&nbsp;million wereup 29% from the first quarter and up 60% from the second quarter of 2001 drivenby strong performances across the consumer credit businesses and middle market.ROE for the second quarter was 26%, compared to 21% last quarter and 19% forthe second quarter of 2001.Operating revenues of $3.50&nbsp;billion were up 11% from the first quarter and 27%from the second quarter of 2001 driven by continued high production volumesacross all consumer businesses and low interest rates. Home Finance revenueswere driven by an increase in customer servicing balances and higher mortgageorigination and servicing margins impacted by business mix and a strong housingenvironment as well as better servicing risk management performance resultingfrom lower rates. Managed credit card outstandings increased 29% from June&nbsp;30,2001 to $49.5&nbsp;billion (which includes other unsecured consumer and commercialcredit card portfolios) due to the Providian acquisition in the first quarterof 2002 and to organic growth. Total deposits grew 2% from the first quarter and12% from the second quarter of 2001.Operating expenses of $1.67&nbsp;billion increased by 7% from the first quarter andby 16% from the second quarter of 2001. The increases reflected the impact ofhigher expenses related to higher volumes. Savings generated by Six Sigmaproductivity programs continued to partially offset the growth in expenses.Managed credit costs of $736&nbsp;million were 1% higher than the first quarter andwere 17% higher than the second quarter of 2001, primarily due to increasedcharge-offs related to the full quarter impact of the Providian credit cardportfolio. The provision related to consumer credits was lower thanthe net charge-offs for the 2002 second quarter because of a lowerretained portfolio of credit cards and because of improvement in lossrates in Auto Finance and lower delinquency ratios in cards.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within RMMFS. For further information on the quarterlybusiness-related metrics of these businesses, see page 54.NM &#151; Not meaningful.31 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Cardmember ServicesCardmember Services had record operating revenues in the second quarter of2002, up 39% from the second quarter of last year and 10% from the firstquarter of 2002. The increase from last year was due to the acquisition of theProvidian Master Trust credit card portfolio in February of this year, higheraverage loans outstanding, lower funding costs to support these assets andhigher credit card fees. The higher fees were the result of a 17% increase intransaction volume (customer purchases, cash advances and balance transfers),and higher levels of delinquencies, which increased late fees. The favorablevariance from the 2002 first quarter reflected the full quarter impact of theProvidian acquisition. End of period outstandings increased 29% from lastyear's second quarter to almost $50&nbsp;billion.Operating earnings of $178&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 were a record,58% above the second quarter of last year and 18% from the immediate pastquarter. The increase from the second quarter of 2001 was primarilyattributable to the acquisition of Providian, as well as higher transactionvolume and higher average loans. The increase from the first quarter of 2002largely reflects higher transaction volume and average loans.The managed net charge-off rate of 6.41% for the second quarter of 2002, up 84and 59 basis points, respectively, from last year's second quarter and thefirst quarter of this year, was primarily due to the impact of Providian. ExcludingProvidian, the managed net charge-off rate would have been 5.92% and 5.76% forthe second and first quarters of 2002, respectively. It isanticipated that the managed netcharge-off rate in the second half of 2002 will improvefrom the second quarter 2002 rate because of decreases in the 30-, 60- and 90-dayperiod delinquencies.Regional Banking GroupRegional Banking Group's second quarter 2002 operating revenue of $726&nbsp;milliondeclined 10% from the 2001 second quarter but only slightly from the 2002 firstquarter. The decline in operating revenue reflected the impact of the lowerinterest rate environment, which resulted in lower net interest earned ondeposit balances. This was partially offset by a 7% growth in overall volume ofretail deposits. Deposits grew 10% excluding the impact of the sale of theNational Deposit group.Operating earnings declined 31% from the second quarter of 2001 due to thelower interest rate environment partially offset by the higher deposit balancesand lower credit costs due to improved credit quality. Operating earningsdeclined 29% from the first quarter of 2002 principally from the gain on saleof the National Deposit group and the reduction of loan loss reserves (improvedcredit quality) in the first quarter. In addition, the second quarter includedthe integration costs related to the Dreyfus discount brokerage acquisition.The overhead ratio in the 2002 second quarter increased from the same periodlast year to 78% as a result of lower revenues.Home FinanceHome Finance's second quarter 2002 operating revenue of $772&nbsp;million increased87% from the comparable quarter last year and 46% from the prior quarter of thecurrent year. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong operatingperformance and the net positive results of servicing risk managementactivities relating to the hedging of the value of mortgage servicing rightsrecorded on the balance sheet. The significant increase in operatingperformance from both past quarters were driven by the prolonged strength ofthe U.S. housing market, low rates, growth in servicing volume, and thecontinued expansion and share growth of higher margin businesses (direct toconsumer and home equity). The current quarter net positive results fromservicing risk management of $186&nbsp;million were driven by very highmortgage-swap spreads and a favorable interest rate environment. Managementanticipates an eventual decrease in this revenue component as spreads andinterest rates revert to normal levels.Operating earnings of $268&nbsp;million rose 171% versus the second quarter of 2001and 103% relative to the prior linked quarter. The earnings this quarter werethe second consecutive record level for Home Finance. These earningsinclude slightly higher credit costs as reflected in the increase innet charge-off rates shown on page&nbsp;54, primarily as a result oflosses realized on the transfer of certain subprime loans to a heldfor sale portfolio.Originations (residential, home equity and manufactured housing) for the secondquarter of 2002 were $27&nbsp;billion and included originations from the retail,wholesale and correspondent (traditional and negotiated) channels. The mortgageservicing portfolio was $436&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002, an increase of 7% fromthe same quarter last year. Over this same time period, the carrying value ofmortgage servicing rights declined 20% from $7.1&nbsp;billion to $5.7&nbsp;billion. Theoverhead ratio decreased to 39% primarily due to the aforementioned strongrevenue growth.Middle MarketsMiddle Markets' operating revenues in the 2002 second quarter increased 2% incomparison with the second quarter of last year but were 2% lower than thefirst quarter of this year. The increase from last year was the result of newcash management contracts and increased banking services and fees from lendingtransactions. The decline from the 2002 first quarter was attributable to theeffects of the lower interest rate environment and other seasonal factors.Operating earnings rose 52% over the second quarter of 2001 and 12% from thefirst quarter primarily due to lower credit costs. The decrease in credit costswas driven by a general improvement in the credit quality of the Middle Marketsloan portfolio and significant recoveries. The overhead ratio improved by 300bp from the second quarter of 2001 as a result of the lower expense level inthe second quarter of 2002.Auto FinanceAuto Finance's operating revenue increased 23% from the second quarter of 2001but declined 2% from the 2002 first quarter. The revenue increase from the 2001second quarter was principally due to the impact of the favorable interest rateenvironment, an 8% growth in origination volume, and higher auto loans andleases outstanding. The revenue decrease from the 2002 first quarter was due tothe reduced gain recorded from loan securitizations in the second quartercompared to the first quarter of 2002.32 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating earnings increased 128% from the 2001 second quarter and 148% fromfirst quarter of 2002. The increase was primarily due to the growth in theportfolio, higher spreads on the receivables outstanding, and lower creditcosts due to reduced reserve for loan loss levels, reflectingimproved loss rates. The overhead ratio for the current year second quarter was 35%,decreasing from the prior year as a result of higher revenue growth combinedwith increased efficiency in expenses.INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile of Investment Management & PrivateBanking (&#147;IMPB&#148;) see pages 34-35 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report. Thefollowing table reflects selected financial data for IMPB.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.Investment Management & Private Banking had operating earnings of $118&nbsp;million,down 6% from the first quarter and 2% higher than the second quarter of 2001.Pre-tax margin in the second quarter was 21% compared with 22% last quarter and19% in the second quarter of 2001.Operating revenues of $691&nbsp;million in the second quarter were 5% below thefirst quarter and 12% lower than the second quarter of 2001. Continued declinesin global equity markets valuations and eroding investor activity levelsaccounted for most of the decreases. Operating expenses of $520&nbsp;million for thequarter were 5% lower than the first quarter and down 18% from the secondquarter of 2001 as a result of continued reductions in compensation and otherexpenses. Credit costs of $23&nbsp;million were equal to the firstquarter of 2002 but higher than credit costs of $2&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2001reflecting the generally weaker credit environment.The table below reflects the assets under management in IMPB as of June&nbsp;30,2002.Total assets under management at quarter-end of $541&nbsp;billion were 7% lower thanthe first quarter and down 11% from the second quarter of 2001. Falling equityprices accounted for most of the year-on-year declines; outflows frominstitutional cash management products accounted for the balance. These effectsoutweighed continued positive flows and a year-over-year increase in assetsunder management for the retail mutual funds.33 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMorgan Partners, see pages 36-37of the JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of JPMorgan Partners.JPMorgan Partners had an operating loss of $165&nbsp;million for the 2002 secondquarter compared with an operating loss of $248&nbsp;million in the first quarterand an operating loss of $610&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2001.Total net private equity gains were negative $125&nbsp;million, as compared tonegative $255&nbsp;million in the first quarter and negative $823&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2001. The second quarter 2002 results were driven bywrite-downs and write-offs on private holdings of $216&nbsp;million and netmark-to-market losses on public securities of $20&nbsp;million, partially offset bynet realized gains of $111&nbsp;million. Losses were concentrated inTMT&nbsp;investments. There are limited exit opportunities and constrainedfinancing in the private equity markets and continued weakness in theTMT&nbsp;sector is likely to contribute to further write-downs in the portfolio.(a)&nbsp;Includes mark-to-market and reversals of mark-to-market due to publicsecurities sales.(b)&nbsp;Includes the impact of portfolio hedging activities.34 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Partners Investment PortfolioThe following table presents the carrying values and costs of the JPMPinvestment portfolio for the dates indicated.(a)&nbsp;Publicly traded positions only.(b)&nbsp;Represents the number of companies and funds at June&nbsp;30, 2002.The following table presents information about the 10 largest holdings ofpublic securities in the JPMP investment portfolio at June&nbsp;30, 2002:(a)&nbsp;Does not include 3.3&nbsp;million shares held directly by the holding company,received upon distribution from JPMP.Technology, media and telecommunications (&#147;TMT&#148;) investments at June&nbsp;30, 2002were $1.7&nbsp;billion, or 20% of the total portfolio, compared with$2.1&nbsp;billion, or 24% of the portfolio, at March&nbsp;31, 2002.The Firm believes that JPMP will create value over time. Given thevolatile nature of the markets, and the Nasdaq market in particular, JPMP'sreported results for any period may include significant public securitiesunrealized gains or losses. The Firm makes no assumptions about the unrealizedgains or losses that may be experienced by the JPMP portfolio. JPMP'sinvestment pace continues to be slow, at $149&nbsp;million during the second quarterof 2002, with deal flow well diversified across industry sectors.35 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's support units include Enterprise Technology Services,Corporate Business Services, legal, audit and finance. For a further discussionof the business profiles of these Support Units as well as a description ofCorporate, see page 41 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.NM &#150; Not meaningful.Corporate reflects the accounting effects remaining at the corporate levelafter the application of management accounting policies of the Firm. Thesepolicies include the allocation of costs associated with technology,operational and staff support services with the respective revenue generatingbusinesses and allow management to evaluate business performance on anallocated basis.This sector usually operates at a small loss. Negative revenue is theresult of the over-allocation of capital to the other businesssectors, and to theover-allocation of revenues that arises from the application of fundstransfer pricing and other management accounting policies. Expense itemsusually result from timing differences in allocations to otherbusiness sectors and residuals from interoffice allocation among thebusiness segments. Tax expense reflects the difference between theaggregate recorded at the consolidated level and the amount recordedat the segments.Although the Corporate segment has no traditional creditproduct assets, the residual component of the allowance for credit losses ismaintained at the corporate level. That is because the residual component ofthe allowance is not allocated to any specific line of business. Inaddition, for 2001, credit costs reflected the difference between theaggregate provision recorded at the consolidated level and theprovision allocated to the business segments. For a further discussion of theresidual component, see pages&nbsp;26 and 44.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Firm's accounting policies are integral to understanding the resultsreported. The Firm's most complex accounting policies requiremanagement's judgment to ascertain the valuation of certain assets andliabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control proceduresthat are intended to ensure that valuation methods are well-controlled andapplied consistently from period to period. In addition,the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process forchanging methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm's mostcritical accounting policies involving the more significant managementvaluation judgments involve the accounting for the allowance for loan lossesand for the fair value of financial instruments. For a further description ofthe types of judgments and estimates required in these accounting policies, seepage 41 and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2001 AnnualReport.36 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RISK MANAGEMENTJPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operationaland business, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion of theserisks and definitions of terms associated with managing these risks, see pages45-62 and the Glossary of Terms in the 2001 Annual Report.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk profile as of June&nbsp;30,2002 focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and should beread in conjunction with pages 47-54 and 75-77 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 AnnualReport.The Firm assesses its credit exposures on a managed basis, taking into accountthe impact of credit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of credit costson a managed, or operating basis, to reported results, seepage&nbsp;27 of thisForm&nbsp;10-Q. The following table presents the Firm's credit-related informationfor the dates indicated.JPMorgan Chase's managed credit-related assets were $309&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30,2002, reflecting a slight decline compared with December&nbsp;31, 2001 and an increaseof 1% compared with June&nbsp;30, 2001. Commercial loans wereessentially unchanged from year-end 2001 and decreased 7% from June&nbsp;30, 2001.The decline in commercial loans since June&nbsp;30, 2001 was theresult of current economic conditions, as well as the Firm's ongoing discipline of originating loansfor distribution and its strategy to reduce its commercial credit exposure.37 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Consumer managed credit-related assets increased $0.9&nbsp;billion since December31, 2001, reflecting growth in the credit card portfolio, offset in part by adecline in the residential mortgage warehouse portfolio as a result ofincreased loan sales.Commercial credit-related assets (consisting ofloans and derivatives) considered investment grade were approximately69% at June&nbsp;30, 2002, compared with 65% at year-end 2001. The increase is dueto short-term financings at quarter end (subsequently repaid) and agreater percentage of investment grade derivative counterparties.At June 30, 2002, 79% of the Firm's total commercial credit exposureof $416 billion (which includescredit-related assets and unfunded commercial commitments) was considered investment gradecompared with 77% considered investment grade at year-end 2001.The Firm has experienced, during the first six months of 2002, a significantdeterioration in the credit quality of commercial loans in thetelecommunications (includes other companies with an interdependence upon thetelecommunications sector) and cable sectors and, to a lesser extent, themerchant energy sector. Excluding these three industry sectors, the creditquality of the commercial loan portfolio has improved over the same time frame.As of June&nbsp;30, 2002, credit-related assets in the telecom and cable sectorswere $9&nbsp;billion and $3&nbsp;billion, respectively, or 5% and 2% of total commercialcredit-related assets. The investment grade portion of total credit-related assetsin these sectors was 51% and 24%, respectively, as of June&nbsp;30, 2002. Merchantenergy represented a further $1&nbsp;billion, or less than 1%, of total commercialcredit-related assets at June&nbsp;30, 2002, of which 32% was considered investmentgrade.The telecom industry worldwide and the cableindustry, particularly in Europe, have been adversely affected byinsufficient resources to fund capital expenditures as well as bysevere liquidity constraints. The Firm has seen a concurrentdeterioration in the risk profile of its telecom and cablecredit-related assets, particularly in the emerging telecom andEuropean cable segments of the portfolio. Credit-related assetsdeemed criticized by the Firm in the telecom and cable sectors haveincreased from $1.1 billion to $2 billion since year-end. Since the end of the second quarter, there has beena furtherdeterioration in the credits that are criticized and, as a result, it is likely therewill be an increase in nonperforming loans in these sectors over thebalance of the year.Total nonperforming assets were $4.4&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002, which included$1.13&nbsp;billion in Enron-related surety receivables and letter of credit.Excluding this amount, which is the subject of litigation with credit-worthyentities, nonperforming assets totaled $3.2&nbsp;billion. Thiscompares with $2.8&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001 and $2.5&nbsp;billion as of June30, 2001. The increase in nonperforming assets from year-end was primarily dueto the continued weakness in the telecom and cable sectors of the commercialloan portfolio.Total net charge-offs in the Firm's managed commercial and consumer portfoliowere $1.2&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2002, comparatively flat withthe first quarter. An increase in consumer charge-offs (primarily due to thefull-quarter impact of the Providian credit card portfolio) was offset by aslight decline in charge-offs in the commercial portfolio. Excluding the impactof Providian, the managed credit card charge-off rate would have been5.89%, compared with 5.54% in the second quarter of 2001. Theincrease in commercial charge-offs in the first half of 2002 compared with 2001was largely due to domestic and foreign charge-offs in the telecommunicationsindustry. Telecom represented 34% of total commercial charge-offs in the firsthalf of 2002.COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO38 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table presents the Firm's commercial credit exposure for the dates indicated.(a)&nbsp;Includes unused advised lines of credit totaling $18&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002.The following discussion relates to the specific loancategories within the commercial portfolio:Commercial and Industrial: The domestic commercial and industrial portfoliodecreased $2.5&nbsp;billion from 2001&nbsp;year-end. Net charge-offs in the 2002 secondquarter were $194&nbsp;million, compared with $158&nbsp;million in the second quarter of2001. Nonperforming domestic commercial and industrial loans were$1,312&nbsp;million, an increase of $126&nbsp;million from the 2001&nbsp;year-end. The foreigncommercial and industrial portfolio totaled $33.4&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002,comparatively flat with year-end 2001. Nonperforming foreign commercial andindustrial loans were $1,073&nbsp;million, an increase of $394&nbsp;million from year-end2001. Net charge-offs in the foreign commercial and industrial loan portfoliofor the second quarter of 2002 increased to $95&nbsp;million from $39&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2001.Financial Institutions: Loans to financial institutions increased $3.4&nbsp;billionwhen compared with year-end. Nonperforming financialinstitution loans decreased from $56&nbsp;million at year-end to $26&nbsp;million at June30, 2002.39 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Enron-related exposureThe Firm's exposure to Enron and Enron-related entities as of June&nbsp;30, 2002 was$1,682&nbsp;million. The exposure is comprised of the following:For additional discussion of the accounting policies related to the above categories,refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2001 Annual Report.The Firm charged-off and wrote-down $456&nbsp;million of Enron-related exposure in thefourth quarter of 2001. During the first six months of 2002, theFirm'sexposure to Enron was reduced by an additional $24&nbsp;million as aresult of charge-offs and valuation adjustments. The Firm willcontinue to adjust the valuation of its exposures to Enronnonperforming loans and trading assets in future periods, as appropriate;the Firm currently believes future losses related to nonperforming loans andtrading assets will not be material. For a discussion of the Firm'srisks associated with the surety receivables included within otherassets, see Legal Proceedings on pages&nbsp;56-58 of thisForm&nbsp;10-Q.Derivative and Foreign Exchange ContractsFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized byJPMorgan Chase in connection with its trading and Assets/Liabilities (&#147;A/L&#148;)activities, see Note&nbsp;16 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q, and pages 51 and 52 and Note 24 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at June&nbsp;30,2002 and December&nbsp;31, 2001.The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of June&nbsp;30, 2002, of theFirm's balance sheet exposure to derivative and foreign exchange contracts, net ofcash and other highly liquid collateral held by the Firm. The Firm's internalrisk ratings generally represent a risk profile similar to that of theindependent rating agencies; ratings below are based upon the Firm's internalobligor risk ratings and are presented on a Standard & Poor's-equivalent basis:The majority of the Firm's derivatives are enteredinto for trading purposes. Certain of the Firm'strading-related derivatives include provisions that require the Firm, uponspecified downgrades in its credit ratings to terminate the derivativecontract (generally upon J.P. Morgan Chase Bank being rated BBB), or to post collateral for the benefit of the counterparty.40 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Country ExposureThe following discussion is based on management's view of country exposure. Fora further discussion of the Firm's country exposure, see page 52 of the 2001Annual Report.During the second quarter of 2002, the Firm's key country exposures remainedcomparatively the same or declined. The Firm has been carefully monitoring itsexposure to Brazil in light of the deteriorating economic condition in thecountry. Exposure to Brazil declined to $2.1&nbsp;billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2002,compared with $2.7&nbsp;billion as of March&nbsp;31, 2002 and $3.3&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2001. Thedecline was due to loan maturities, declines in counterparty exposures onderivatives, and a lower level of local issuer exposures. The reduction incounterparty exposure includes the effect of fair value adjustments onderivatives. Mark-to-market exposures on derivatives in Brazil are sensitive tomoves in local interest rates and foreign exchange rates.In Argentina, exposure (before allowance for loan losses) totaled $378&nbsp;millionat June&nbsp;30, 2002, compared to $589&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2001. The decreasewas due to an $82&nbsp;million decline on trading assets, a $46&nbsp;million decline dueto write-downs on equity investments and an $83&nbsp;million decline on loans due toa combination of charge-offs taken and loan payments received. The Firm will continue to adjust its exposures to Argentina in future periods, as appropriate; however, the Firm currently believes future losses related to Argentineloans and trading assets will not be material. Exposure to Uruguay, which is suffering a financial crisis,remains limited. In Japan, exposures declined due to fluctuations in tradingpositions and mark-to-market exposure on derivatives that are sensitive toforeign exchange rates. Trading exposure includes credit derivative positionswhere the Firm has purchased credit protection to hedge lendingexposure. Exposure to Turkey declined across product categories, driven by loanand derivative maturities as well as reduction in bond trading positions.The following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries.41 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CONSUMER PORTFOLIOJPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio is primarily domestic and is geographicallywell-diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled $134.9billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002, an increase of approximately $1&nbsp;billion since 2001year-end. Consumer net charge-offs, on a managed basis, were $862&nbsp;million and$586&nbsp;million for the second quarter of 2002 and 2001, respectively. Theincrease was primarily due to an increase in credit card net charge-offs due, inpart, to a higher level of outstandings and the impact of the Providianacquisition.The following discussion relates to the specific loan categorieswithin the consumer portfolio:Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $52.7&nbsp;billion atJune&nbsp;30, 2002, a $6.8&nbsp;billion decrease from the 2001&nbsp;year-end. Nonperforming 1-4family residential mortgage loans decreased $5&nbsp;million from year-end. The netcharge-off rate of 0.16% for the second quarter of 2002 increased from thesecond quarter of 2001 due to losses realized on the transfer of certainsubprime loans to a held for sale portfolio. At June&nbsp;30, 2002, the Firmhad $2&nbsp;billion of subprime residential mortgage loans, of which$1.4&nbsp;billion were held for sale. In addition, the Firm had atJune&nbsp;30, 2002, $12.1&nbsp;billion of securitized loans relatingto subprime 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, including $4.3&nbsp;billionrelated to the Advanta mortgage business acquired in2001.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet aswell as credit card receivables that have been securitized.42 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Managed credit card receivables were approximately$48.5&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002, an increaseof 19% when compared with year-end 2001. The increase reflects theacquisition of credit card assets from Providian in February 2002.At June&nbsp;30, 2002, the Firm had $1.1&nbsp;billion of subprime credit card loans (nosubprime credit card loans were securitized). During the 2002 second quarter,net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit card receivables increased to6.42%, compared with 5.54% at June&nbsp;30, 2001. Loans over 90&nbsp;days pastdue decreased to 1.98% of the portfolio at June&nbsp;30, 2002, compared with 2.22%at December&nbsp;31, 2001. Management anticipates that the managed credit card netcharge-off ratio for the full-year 2002 will be higher than full-year 2001, duein part to the contribution of the Providian card portfolio.Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased by $1&nbsp;billion at June30, 2002, when compared with year-end 2001. The charge-off rate of 0.43% forthe 2002 second quarter continues to be indicative of this portfolio'sselective approach to asset origination. Total originations were $5.2&nbsp;billionfor the second quarter of 2002, compared with $4.8&nbsp;billion for the comparableperiod in 2001.Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans of $7.0&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002declined 13% compared with year-end levels. The net charge-off rate related tothis portfolio increased in the 2002 second quarter to 2.35%, as a result of slightly higher charge-offs in adiscontinued installment loan portfolio.Allowance for Credit LossesLoans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of June&nbsp;30, 2002 for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.The allowance has both specific and expected loss components anda residual component to reflect the lower credit quality in theFirm's loan portfolio.As of June&nbsp;30, 2002, management deemed the allowance to be adequate (i.e.,sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable). The allowance represented 2.36% of loans at June&nbsp;30, 2002,compared with 2.08% at year-end 2001. The allowance for credit losses was increasedby $482&nbsp;million from year-end 2001 and by $1.3&nbsp;billion from June&nbsp;30, 2001.The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $1,212&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2002, an increase of $156&nbsp;million, or 15%, from year-end 2001. Thespecific loss component covers those commercial loans deemed by the Firm to becriticized. The Firm internally categorizes its criticized commercial loansinto three groups: doubtful, substandard, and special mention. All doubtfulloans and some substandard loans are categorized as nonperforming. The increasein the specific loss component is primarily due to the deteriorationin the telecom and cable sectors, which has led to an increase in criticized loansand to an increase in nonperforming loans.43 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $594&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2002, a decrease of $74&nbsp;million or 11% from year-end 2001. Theexpected loss component covers noncriticized commercial loans, and is a productof default probability and loss severity. Default probability is a weightedproduct of actual average defaults through the credit cycle and acurrent market estimate of defaults, and loss severity is based on the Firm'shistorical experience. These factors are continuously refined, andchanges in these factors had no significant impact on thedetermination of the expected loss component during the first half ofthe year. The $74&nbsp;milliondecrease in the expected loss component was due to a reduction in amount, andthe improvement in average quality, of the noncriticized portion of the loanportfolio.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.4&nbsp;billion at June30, 2002, an increase of $282&nbsp;million, or 13%, from year-end 2001. The increasewas due to the acquisition of the Providian portfolio by Chase CardmemberServices and an increase in the net charge-off rate of the Chase Home Financeportfolio, partially offset by a reduction in the amount of retained creditcard loans (excluding the Providian acquisition), and a reduction of expectedloss rates in the Chase Auto Finance portfolio due to improved delinquencyrates.The residual component of the allowance was $813&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2002, anincrease of $118&nbsp;million, or 17%, from year-end 2001. The residual component isintended to cover both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The Firmanticipates that the residual component will range between 10% and 20% of thetotal allowance for loan losses. At June&nbsp;30, 2002, the residual componentrepresented approximately 16% of the total allowance for loan losses.Lending-Related Commitments: JPMorgan Chase also has an allowance for itsoff-balance sheet lending-related commitments, using a methodology similar tothat for the loan portfolio. This allowance, which is reported in OtherLiabilities, was $281&nbsp;million, $282&nbsp;million and $285&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2002,December&nbsp;31, 2001 and June&nbsp;30, 2001, respectively.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTAggregate VAR ExposureJPMorgan Chase's statistical market risk measure value-at-risk (&#147;VAR&#148;) gaugesthe dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinarymarket environment. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VARcalculation that includes its trading and investment portfolios, plus all ofits market risk-related A/L activities.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thefollowing table provides a meaningful overview of the Firm's market riskexposure arising from trading activities and the investment and A/Lportfolios.44 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Histogram:The following histogram illustrates JPMorgan Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income, brokeragecommissions, underwriting fees or other revenue. In the first half of 2002,JPMorgan Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 116 out of125&nbsp;days, with 74&nbsp;days exceeding positive $25&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained on9 of the 125&nbsp;days represented in the histogram. JPMorgan Chase incurred fourdaily trading losses in excess of $20&nbsp;million in the first half of 2002.Stress TestingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. For a further discussion of the Firm's stress testingmethodology, see page 56 of the 2001 Annual Report.The following table represents at, and for theperiods ended, June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the potential economic value stress test loss(pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase'sstress test scenarios.Largest Monthly Stress Test Loss &#150; Pre-TaxLargest Monthly Stress Test Loss &#150; Pre-TaxThe stress results at, and for the period ended,June 30, 2002 were mostly driven by exposures that are sensitive to astress scenario in which credit and equity prices decline and, at thesame time, interest rates fall in the major currencies.45 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and should be read inconjunction with page 46 and Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.CapitalJPMorgan Chase's capital levels at June&nbsp;30, 2002 continued to improve withratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. At June&nbsp;30, 2002, the Tier 1and Total Capital ratios were 8.8% and 12.7%, respectively, and the Tier 1leverage ratio was 5.4%. At June&nbsp;30, 2002, the total capitalization of JPMorganChase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was $55.9&nbsp;billion, an increase of$1.8&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2001. Approximately half of the increase was dueto changes in Tier 1 capital, reflecting $0.6&nbsp;billion in retainedearnings (net income less common and preferred dividends) generated during theperiod, the issuance of $1&nbsp;billion in trust preferred securities, and the netstock issuance of $0.5&nbsp;billion related to employee benefit plans, partially offset by the redemption of $550million in preferred stock of subsidiary. The balance of the increase was attributable to increases in the subordinated debt and allowance for creditlosses components of Tier 2 capital. The Firm did not repurchase shares of itscommon stock during the first six months.DividendsIn the second quarter of 2002, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cashdividend on its common stock of $0.34 per share payable July&nbsp;31, 2002 tostockholders of record at the close of business July&nbsp;5, 2002. In recent years, JPMorgan Chase has had a policy of paying common stockdividends at a level that over time would be in the range of 25%-35% of anamount equal to operating earnings less preferred stock dividends. The Firmcontinues to consider this range an appropriate target over the medium- andlong-term. However, dividends above this range may be declared for a period ifthe Firm's results for the relevant period are below what the Firm considersits medium- or long-term operating earnings capacity, as has been thecase since the merger of The Chase Manhattan Corporation and J.P.Morgan & Co. Incorporated. Dividends declared in any quarter will be determinedby JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors after taking into consideration factorssuch as the Firm's current earnings, expected medium- and long-term operatingearnings, financial condition, regulatory capital position and applicablegovernmental regulations and policies.The following table shows JPMorgan Chase's capital generation and use duringthe periods indicated.Economic risk capital: JPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy by measuringrisk utilizing internal risk assessment methodologies. The Firm quantifiescredit, market and operating risk for each business and, for JPMP, privateequity risk, and assigns capital to each business accordingly. Thesemethodologies are discussed in the risk management sections of the 2001 AnnualReport on pages 45-62. The following table presents the assessment at June&nbsp;30, 2002 of capitaladequacy for each risk factor as estimated by the Firm's economic capitalallocation model. Credit risk capital increased since June&nbsp;30, 2001 due to higherretail credit exposure (principally as a result of the acquisition of the Providian portfolio) and higher capitalfactors on, and downward migration of, the commercial loan portfolio.The increase in market risk capital is due largely to an increase in stressloss exposure in several trading businesses, primarily Credit & Rate Marketsand Institutional Equities. Private equity capital declined over the period dueto the lower carrying value of the portfolio. Internal capital allocations may change from time to time to reflect refinements of economic capital methodologies.46 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer topages 58-59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.&nbsp;LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk management shouldbe read in conjunction with pages 60-61 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.LiquidityDuring the first six months of 2002, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $9.6billion of long-term debt and $1&nbsp;billion of trust preferred capital securities.During the same period, $7.7&nbsp;billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed,and $550&nbsp;million of preferred stock of subsidiary was redeemed.JPMorgan Chase has access to diverse global funding sources. The Firm usesasset securitization programs as alternative funding sources, to provideliquidity and for asset/liability management purposes. During the secondquarter of 2002, the Firm securitized approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion of residentialmortgage loans, $4.4&nbsp;billion of credit card loans, $1.4&nbsp;billion of automobileloans and $1.3&nbsp;billion of commercial loans, resulting in pre-tax gains onsecuritizations of $47&nbsp;million, $18&nbsp;million, $0.4&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million,respectively. For a further discussion on loan securitizations, see Note 8 onpage 12.Derivatives are used in liquidity risk management to swap fixed-ratedebt to floating-rate obligations and to swap floating-rate debt to fixed-rateobligations to achieve the Firm's desired interest rate risk profile. The Firmalso enters into derivatives contracts to hedge the cash flow risk associatedwith the variability in interest rates that arises from other floating-ratefinancial instruments and forecasted transactions such as the rollover of short-term assets and liabilities.Credit ratingsThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by creditratings. A reduction in these ratings could increase funding costs and limit marketaccess. See Note 1 and page 40 of this Form 10-Q for furtherinformation about the implications of a ratings downgrade for theFirm.JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company credit ratings as of August&nbsp;9, 2002 were as follows:The ratings of the senior obligations of JPMorgan Chase Bank are generally onenotch higher than the parent holding company. As of August&nbsp;9, 2002, the ratingsoutlook for the parent holding company by Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitchwere negative.47 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity risk management, refer topage 62 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.&nbsp;SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001Form 10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries, without the approval of their relevantbanking regulators, could pay dividends to their respective bank holdingcompanies in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks byregulatory restrictions. These dividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaledapproximately $3.2&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSIn May 2002, the FASB released an exposure draft of an amendment to SFAS 133,which establishes accounting and reporting standards for all derivativeinstruments. The amendment clarifies the definition of a derivative andestablishes accounting guidance for beneficial interests in securitizedfinancial assets. The Firm is currently reviewing the exposure draft, and itsimpact is yet to be determined.In July 2002, the FASB released an exposure draft on Consolidation of CertainSpecial-Purpose Entities, an interpretation of ARB No.&nbsp;51. The proposedinterpretation provides guidance for determining when an entity is not an SPE,and would therefore not be subject to this proposed interpretation. Theproposed interpretation also introduces a new framework to identify when acontrolling financial interest has been established by means other than votinginterests and requires consolidation of an SPE by an enterprise that holds sucha controlling financial interest (the primary beneficiary). The proposedinterpretation is not intended to require consolidation if the SPE effectivelydisperses the risks and benefits among the various parties involved. The Firmis currently reviewing the exposure draft, and its impact is yet to bedetermined.48 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

JPMorgan Chase is involved in a number oflawsuits and investigations arising out of its banking relationships with EnronCorp. and its subsidiaries (&#147;Enron&#148;). The Firm, for and on behalf of MahoniaLimited and Mahonia Natural Gas Limited (collectively, &#147;Plaintiffs&#148;) initiateda lawsuit in New York in December 2001 against eleven insurance companies. Thatsuit, which is currently pending in the United States District Courtfor the Southern District of New York, seeks payment of $965&nbsp;million under Enron-related surety bonds issued bythese companies. The Firm also commenced a lawsuit in London againstWestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale seeking to compel payment of $165&nbsp;millionunder an Enron-related letter of credit issued by the bank. On March&nbsp;5, 2002,the court in New York denied the Firm's motion for summary judgment against theinsurance companies, ordered discovery, and set a trial date of December&nbsp;2,2002.On June&nbsp;28, 2002, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include fraud andbreach of contract claims arising out of the defendants' issuance of the suretybonds. The breach of contract claim asserts the insurance company defendantshave failed to make payment in breach of their obligations under the suretybonds, each of which states that the obligations of each surety are absolute andunconditional, irrespective of the value, validity or enforceability of theobligations of the Principal which, in this case, is Enron. JPMorgan Chaseasserts an independent claim against the56 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)insurance company defendants for fraudbased on their failure to disclose certain facts known to the defendants at thetime they issued the surety bonds, which facts the defendants knew JPMorganChase did not know, and which they knew, if disclosed, would have causedJPMorgan Chase to refuse to accept the surety bonds as security fortransactions with Enron. JPMorgan Chase has alleged in its amended complaintthat these fraud claims arise from a scheme by the defendant insurancecompanies to generate premium revenue by inducing JPMorgan Chase to accept thesurety bonds issued by the defendants in the place of letters of credit. Thedefendant insurance companies have moved to dismiss JPMorgan Chase's fraudclaims. JPMorgan Chase's opposition to that motion to dismiss is due on August12, 2002, and oral argument on that motion has been scheduled for August&nbsp;27,2002.Each of the defendant insurance companies has also asserted affirmativedefenses, as well as counterclaims, for misrepresentation and fraud, amongother things, claiming that Plaintiffs misrepresented the nature of theunderlying forward sale contracts for the delivery/supply of natural gas orcrude oil. The defendant insurance companies contend that JPMorgan Chase,Mahonia and Enron misrepresented, concealed and/or withheld material facts,which would have revealed to the defendant insurance companies that the forwardsale contracts were actually &#147;disguised&#148; loans without any real deliveryobligations. Based on those defenses, among others, the defendant insurancecompanies seek to avoid liability under the surety bonds. Plaintiffs believedefendants' affirmative defenses and counterclaims lack merit as a matter offact and law.Actions have also been initiated by other parties against JPMorgan Chaseand its directors and certain of its officers involving Enron. These lawsuitsinclude a series of purported class actions brought on behalf of shareholdersof Enron, captioned Newby v. Enron Corp., and a series of purported classactions brought on behalf of Enron employees who participated in variousemployee stock ownership plans, captioned Tittle v. EnronCorp., both of whichare pending in Houston. The consolidated complaint filed inNewby names asdefendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment banking firms, two law firms,Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities and individuals and otherindividual defendants, including present and former officers and directors ofEnron and purports to allege claims against JPMorgan Chase and the otherdefendants under federal and state securities laws. The Tittle complaint namesas defendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment bankingfirms, a law firm, Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities andindividuals and other individual defendants, including present and formerofficers and directors of Enron and purports to allege claims against JPMorganChase and certain other defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (&#147;RICO&#148;) and state common law. On May&nbsp;8, 2002, JPMorgan Chasefiled motions to dismiss the Newby and Tittle actions, on the grounds that theallegations in the consolidated complaints in each action against JPMorganChase, even if assumed to be true (which allegations JPMorgan Chase vigorouslydenies) fail to state a cause of action. In moving to dismiss theNewby action,JPMorgan Chase argued, among other things, that the allegations against itstated, at most, a theory of aiding and abetting liability that has beenrejected by the United States Supreme Court in Central Bank of Denver v. FirstInterstate Bank of Denver. Central Bank and subsequent cases applying it holdthat aiding and abetting another's alleged fraud is not actionable under thefederal securities laws. In seeking dismissal of the Newby action, JPMorganChase also argued that plaintiffs had otherwise failed to state a claim againstJPMorgan Chase under federal or state securities laws because the consolidatedcomplaint failed to allege any intentionally false misrepresentation oromission on the part of JPMorgan Chase. In moving to dismiss theTittle action,JPMorgan Chase argued, among other things, that the RICO statute on whichplaintiffs purported to base their claims was expressly amended to prohibitplaintiffs from bringing claims under RICO alleging fraud in the purchase orsale of securities. JPMorgan Chase's brief in support of its motion to dismissfurther argued that the consolidated complaint in Tittle, otherwise failed tostate a claim against JPMorgan Chase under RICO or state common law because,among other things, plaintiffs failed to allege any intentionally falsemisrepresentation or omission on the part of JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase'smotions to dismiss in Newby and Tittle have been fully briefed and arecurrently pending determination by the court.Additional actions against JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates relating toEnron that have been filed as of August&nbsp;1, 2002 include (i)&nbsp;purported classaction lawsuits by JPMorgan Chase stockholders alleging that JPMorgan Chaseissued false and misleading press releases and other public documents relatingto Enron in violation of Section&nbsp;10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 thereunder; (ii)&nbsp;purported shareholder derivative actionsalleging breaches of fiduciary duties and alleged failures to exercise due careand diligence by the Firm's directors and named officers in the management ofJPMorgan Chase; (iii)&nbsp;a lawsuit filed by the Retirement Systems of Alabamaalleging claims under the Alabama Securities Act and common law claims of fraudand unjust enrichment; (iv)&nbsp;a lawsuit filed by Unicredito Italiano(&#147;Unicredito&#148;) and its affiliate, Bank Pekao SA (&#147;Bank Pekao&#148;), allegingvarious common law claims relating to two credit agreements and a letter ofcredit and reimbursement agreement among Enron and a group of banks, includingThe Chase Manhattan Bank (predecessor to JPMorgan Chase Bank), Unicredito andBank Pekao; (v)&nbsp;a lawsuit filed in Texas state court by eight insurancecompanies and related entities asserting claims under Texas statutory andcommon law arising from alleged purchases of Enron securities; (vi)&nbsp;alawsuit originally filed in Texas State Court, and now removed to federalDistrict Court, by the Brazos Electric Power Cooperative57 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)asserting variousstate common law and statutory claims arising out of The Chase Manhattan Bank,N.A.'s alleged 1994 involvement in a Construction Term and Loan Agreementrelated to the construction and operation of a power plant in Johnson County,Texas; and (vii)&nbsp;a purported class action lawsuit by current and former shareholders of Enron Capital Trust I (&#147;CapitalTrust&#148;) alleging that JPMorgan Chase and another investmentbanking firm participated in ascheme to defraud shareholders of the Capital Trust by, among other actions,misleading the Capital Trust shareholders as to the financial condition ofEnron. JPMorgan Chase believes that each of the lawsuits filed against theFirm, its affiliates, its directors and the named officers is without merit,and the Firm intends to defend each of these actions vigorously.In addition, a number of federal, state and local regulatory and lawenforcement authorities and Congressional committees have initiatedinvestigations of Enron and of certain of the Firm's financial transactionswith Enron. In that regard, the Firm has delivered, or is currently in theprocess of delivering, voluntarily and pursuant to subpoena, information to theHouse Energy and Commerce Committee,the Senate Government Affairs Committee, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee onInvestigations, U.S. Representative Henry Waxman, the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the New York State BankingDepartment, the New York County District Attorney's Office and the U.S.Department of Justice. The Firm intends to continue to cooperate with theseauthorities and with such other agencies and authorities as may requestinformation from JPMorgan Chase.Worldcom litigation. JPMSI and JPMorganChase have been named as defendants in nine actions that were filed in eitherUnited States District Courts or state courts in six states beginning in July2002 arising out of alleged accounting irregularities in the books and recordsof WorldCom Inc. Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors,including state pension funds, who purchased debt securities issued by WorldCompursuant to public offerings in May 2000 and May 2001. JPMSI acted as anunderwriter of both of those offerings. In addition to JPMSI and JPMorganChase, the defendants in various of the actions include otherunderwriters, certain executives of WorldCom and WorldCom's auditors. In theactions, plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or were reckless ornegligent in not knowing that the securities were sold to plaintiffs on thebasis of misrepresentations and omissions of material facts concerning thefinancial condition of WorldCom. The complaints against JPMorgan Chase andJPMSI assert claims under federal and states securities laws, ERISA, otherstate statutes and under common law theories of fraud and negligentmisrepresentation.Commercial Financial Services litigation. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.(&#147;JPMSI&#148;; formerly known as Chase Securities, Inc.) has been named as adefendant or third-party defendant in 16 actions that were filed in either theUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma or inOklahoma state court or New York state court beginning in October 1999 arisingout of the failure of Commercial Financial Services, Inc. (&#147;CFS&#148;). Plaintiffsin these actions are institutional investors who purchased over $1.6&nbsp;billion inoriginal face amount of asset-backed securities issued by CFS. The securitieswere backed by delinquent credit card receivables. In addition to JPMSI, thedefendants in various of the actions are the founders and key executives ofCFS, as well as its auditors, its outside counsel and the rating agencies thatrated the securities. JPMSI is alleged to have been the investment banker toCFS and to have acted asan initial purchaser and as placement agent in connection with the issuance ofcertain of the securities. Plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew orwere reckless in not knowing that the securities were sold to plaintiffs on thebasis of misleading misrepresentations and omissions of material facts. Thecomplaints against JPMSI assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of1934, the Oklahoma Securities Act, and under common law theories of fraud andnegligent misrepresentation. In the actions against JPMSI, damages in theamount of approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion allegedly suffered as a result ofdefendants' misrepresentations and omissions, plus punitive damages, are beingclaimed.IPO Allocation litigation. Beginning in May 2001, JPMorgan Chase andcertain of its securities subsidiaries have been named, along with numerousother firms in the securities industry, as defendants in a large number ofputative class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court forthe Southern District of New York. These suits purport to challenge allegedimproprieties in the allocation of stock in various public offerings, includingsome offerings for which a JPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. Thesuits allege violations of securities and antitrust laws arising from allegedmaterial misstatements and omissions in registration statements andprospectuses for the initial public offerings and with respect to aftermarkettransactions in the offered securities. The securities claims allege, amongother things, misrepresentations concerning commissions paid to JPMorgan Chaseand aftermarket transactions by customers who received allocations of shares inthe respective initial public offerings. The antitrust claims allege an illegalconspiracy to require customers, in exchange for initial public offeringallocations, to pay undisclosed and excessive commissions and to makeaftermarket purchases of the initial public offering securities at a pricehigher than the offering price, as a precondition to receiving allocation.JPMorgan Chase also has received various subpoenas and informal requests fromgovernmental and other agencies seeking information relating to initial publicoffering allocation practices. Recently, JPMSI was advised by the staff of theNational Association of58 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)Securities Dealers (&#147;NASD&#148;) that it was consideringrecommending that disciplinary action be brought concerning activities of oneof JPMSI's predecessor entities (Hambrecht & Quist Group). JPMSI has submittedto the NASD staff a letter outlining the basis for JPMSI's position that nosuch action is warranted.Research Analysts' Conflicts. In connection with its review of theindependence of research analysts, the New York State Attorney General'sOffice, the Texas State Securities Board, the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New YorkStock Exchange have issued subpoenas and other information requests to severalfinancial services firms, including the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with thisinvestigation.In addition to the matters described above, JPMorgan Chase and itssubsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various legalactions and proceedings arising in connection with their respective businessesand have been involved from time to time in investigations and proceedings bygovernmental agencies.
