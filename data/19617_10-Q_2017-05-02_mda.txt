>Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&#160;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note&#32;5&#32;for information on principal transactions revenue.&#32;99Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note&#32;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in&#32;the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.&#32;Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, where&#32;JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where&#32;JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.&#32;100Note 5&#32;&#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for&#32;the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note&#32;7 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.Investment banking feesThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees.&#32;Principal transactionsThe following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.&#32;The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.&#32;&#160;Lending- and deposit-related feesThe following table presents the components of lending- and deposit-related fees. Asset management, administration and commissionsThe following table presents the components of Firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.

Included within&#32;other expense are the following:103Note 10&#32;&#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as trading, AFS or HTM. Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note&#32;2. Predominantly all of&#32;the Firm's AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO within the investment securities portfolio in connection with&#32;the Firm's asset-liability management objectives. At&#32;March 31, 2017, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of&#32;AA+&#32;(based upon external ratings &#160;where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note&#32;12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.104Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at March 31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.105Gross unrealized losses The Firm has recognized unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell as OTTI.&#32;The Firm does not intend to sell any of the remaining securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of March&#160;31, 2017, and it is not likely that&#32;the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income,&#32;the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of March&#160;31, 2017, are not other-than-temporarily impaired.&#32;For additional information on other-than-temporary impairment, see Note&#32;12 of the JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and OTTI losses from AFS securities that were recognized in income.&#32;&#160;Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities The cumulative credit loss component, including any changes therein, of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that&#32;the Firm does not intend to sell was not material as of and during the&#32;three&#32;month periods ended March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and 2016.106Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.&#32;107Note 11 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.&#32;For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected,&#32;see Note 3. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements,&#32;see Note 21.The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of&#32;the Firm's securities financing agreements as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and December 31, 2016. When&#32;the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met,&#32;the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition,&#32;the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparties; this collateral also reduces, in&#32;the Firm's view, the economic exposure with&#32;the counterparty. Such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented as &#8220;Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,&#8221; and reduces the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; presented below, if&#32;the Firm has an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement with the counterparty. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the &#8220;Net amounts&#8221; below, and related collateral does not reduce the amounts presented.&#32;108The tables below present as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 the types of financial assets pledged in securities financing agreements and the remaining contractual maturity of the securities financing agreements.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm held $5.4 billion&#32;and $5.9 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on the Consolidated balance sheets.109Note 12&#32;&#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition.&#32;The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&#160;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. See Note&#32;3&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on&#32;the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note&#32;2&#32;of this Form 10-Q&#32;for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by&#32;the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment&#32;the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.The following tables summarize&#32;the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.&#32;110The following&#32;table provides information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated.&#32;This table excludes loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that&#32;the Firm reduces its credit exposures.&#32;The following table provides information about gains and losses on loan sales, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, by portfolio segment.&#32;Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, consumer and business banking loans, and student loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.&#32;&#160;The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class. In the first quarter of 2017, the Firm transferred the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale. For additional information see Note 24.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. 111Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.&#32;112The following table represents&#32;the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.&#160;HELOCs beyond the revolving period and HELOANs have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period.&#32;That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those&#32;products is higher than the minimum payment options&#32;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into&#32;the Firm's allowance for loan losses.&#32;Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a&#32;TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.113The following&#32;table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by&#32;the Firm.Loan modificationsModifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.&#160;The following table presents new TDRs reported by&#32;the Firm.Nature and extent of modificationsThe U.S. Treasury's Making Home Affordable programs, as well as&#32;the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following&#32;table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm's&#32;loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.114Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following&#32;table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under&#32;the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.&#32;At&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 10 years&#32;for home equity and 14 years&#32;for residential mortgage.&#32;The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).&#160;Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of&#32;$894 million&#32;and $932 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.115Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto and business banking loans.&#32;This table excludes student loans as a result of the transfer of the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2017.116Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.&#160;Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.&#160;See Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.The following table provides information about&#32;the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March 31, 2017&#32;and 2016.117Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.118Approximately&#32;24%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs.&#32;The following table sets forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on the unpaid principal balance as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for&#32;the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and 2016, and represents&#32;the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.Active and suspended foreclosureAt&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of&#32;$1.6 billion&#32;and $1.7 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.&#160;Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's credit card loans.119Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&#32;At March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, $85 million&#32;and $94 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $45 million&#32;and $48 million&#32;at March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.&#32;Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for&#32;60&#32;months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs. New enrollments in these loan modification programs were&#32;$185 million&#32;and $159 million, for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and 2016, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.&#160;Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.&#32;For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become&#32;two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with&#32;the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for modified credit card loans was expected to be&#32;30.60%&#32;and 28.87%&#32;as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively.&#32;120Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &#160;assigned to each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note&#32;14 and Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.&#32;Effective in the first quarter of 2017, the Firm revised its methodology for the assignment of industry classifications, to better monitor and manage concentrations. This largely resulted in the re-assignment of holding companies from Other to the industry of risk category based on the holding company's primary business activity. In the tables below, the prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.121The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note&#32;14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans consist of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about&#32;the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents&#32;the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.&#160;Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the&#32;tables above. TDRs were $842 million&#32;and $733 million&#32;as of March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, respectively.122Note 13&#32;&#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note&#32;15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and related informationThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.&#32;Note: In the first quarter of 2017, the Firm transferred the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale.

Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved,&#32;the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of&#32;the Firm's involvement with&#32;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.124The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in&#32;Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by&#32;the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests, recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative transactions. In certain instances,&#32;the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on&#32;page 128&#32;of this Note for further information regarding&#32;the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and&#32;page 128&#32;of this Note for information on&#32;the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies.125Residential mortgageThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by&#32;CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either&#32;CCB or CIB.

These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent,&#32;remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where&#32;the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,&#32;the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.126Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by&#32;the Firm as of March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.Loan securitizationsThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans.&#32;For a&#32;further description of&#32;the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note&#32;16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.127Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to&#32;the Firm's securitization activities for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and 2016, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by&#32;the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,&#32;the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises&#32;(&#8220;U.S. GSEs&#8221;). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans).&#32;The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.&#32;The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales,&#32;the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser.&#32;See Note 20&#32;of this Form 10-Q, and Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report&#32;for additional information about&#32;the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note&#32;15&#32;for additional information about the impact of&#32;the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.&#160;128Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 20, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. For additional information, refer to Note 12 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.&#160;The following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets as of March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and December&#160;31, 2016. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which&#32;the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.129Note&#32;15&#32;&#8211; Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rightsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.&#160;Goodwill Impairment testingFor further description of the Firm's goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 240&#8211;241 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at March&#160;31, 2017, or December&#160;31, 2016, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;or 2016.Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in equity capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, estimates of adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of&#32;the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.130Mortgage servicing rightsMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note&#32;17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report&#32;and Note&#32;2&#32;of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the&#32;three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and 2016.131The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three months ended March 31, 2017&#32;and 2016.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of&#32;the Firm's MSRs at&#32;March 31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&#160;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which could either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.132Note 16&#32;&#8211; DepositsFor further discussion on deposits, see Note&#32;19 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.At&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.&#160;Note 17&#32;&#8211; Earnings per shareFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), see Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and 2016.133Note 18&#32;&#8211; Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to&#32;the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.134The following table presents the pre-tax and after-tax changes in the components of OCI.135Note 19&#32;&#8211; Regulatory capitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase&#160;Bank&#160;USA,&#160;N.A.Capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S.&#32;bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries. Basel III presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating RWA, a general (Standardized) approach, (&#8220;Basel III Standardized&#8221;) and an advanced approach, (&#8220;Basel III Advanced&#8221;). Certain of the requirements of Basel III are subject to phase-in periods that began on January 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (&#8220;Basel III Transitional&#8221;).There are three categories of risk-based capital under the Basel III Transitional rules: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common&#32;stockholders' equity&#32;(including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS&#32;as well as for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans), less certain deductions for goodwill,&#32;MSRs&#32;and deferred tax assets that arise from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital predominantly consists of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital.&#160;The following&#32;tables&#32;present&#32;the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and its significant national bank subsidiaries&#32;under both Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.136&#160;Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the&#32;Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital to RWA, as well as a minimum leverage ratio (which is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets).&#32;Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the&#32;Federal Reserve to take action.&#32;National bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table presents the minimum ratios to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject as of March&#160;31, 2017.Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject.(e) For the period ended December 31, 2016 the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm were 6.25%, 7.75%, 9.75%&#32;and 4.0%&#32;and the CET1, Tier 1, Total and Tier 1 leverage minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm's banking subsidiaries were 5.125%, 6.625%, 8.625%&#32;and 4.0%&#32;respectively.As of March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, JPMorgan Chase and all of its&#32;banking subsidiaries were&#32;well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.137Note 20&#32;&#8211; Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to&#32;the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or&#32;the Firm&#32;be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in&#32;the Firm's view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and&#32;the Firm's related accounting policies, see Note&#32;29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.&#160;To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note&#32;13&#32;for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products.&#32;The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.&#32;The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition,&#32;the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is&#32;60 days&#32;or more past due.&#32;The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.138139Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.&#32;The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank,&#32;the Firm is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured &#160;clearance advance facilities that&#32;the Firm extends to its clients (i.e., cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit&#32;the Firm's&#32;intra-day credit risk to the facility amount&#32;and must be repaid by the end of the day. As of March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016, the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was&#32;$2.4 billion&#32;for both periods.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by&#32;the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.The following table summarizes the standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements&#32;as of&#32;March&#160;31, 2017, and December&#160;31, 2016.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of creditDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.&#160;The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 4.140Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsIn connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs and in certain private label transactions, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase the mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. In addition, although the Firm's securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. For additional information, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Guarantees of subsidiaryThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorganChase Financial Company LLC (&#8220;JPMFC&#8221;), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company, and these guarantees rank on a parity with the Firm's unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. &#160;Note 21&#32;&#8211; Pledged assets and collateral For a discussion of&#32;the Firm's pledged assets and collateral, see Note&#32;30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.Pledged assets The Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, and cover customer short sales. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated balance sheets.The following table presents the Firm's pledged assets.Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 14&#32;for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm's securities financing activities, see Note 11. For additional information on the Firm's long-term debt, see Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase's 2016 Annual Report.Collateral The Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Collateral was generally used under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover customer short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements.The following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.141Note 22&#32;&#8211; LitigationContingenciesAs of March&#160;31, 2017, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0&#32;to approximately $2.3 billion&#32;at March&#160;31, 2017. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.&#32;The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (&#8220;FX&#8221;) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX-related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of &#160;federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a temporary one-year waiver of disqualification, effective upon entry of judgment, that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;). The Firm's application for a lengthier exemption is pending. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission announced that it had referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal to commence civil proceedings.&#160;The Firm is also one&#32;of a number of foreign exchange dealers defending a class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by U.S.-based plaintiffs, principally alleging violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates (the &#8220;U.S. class action&#8221;). In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement agreement in the U.S. class action. Following this settlement, a number of additional putative class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures (the &#8220;exchanged-based actions&#8221;), consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates (the &#8220;consumer action&#8221;), participants or beneficiaries of qualified ERISA plans (the &#8220;ERISA actions&#8221;), and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments (the &#8220;indirect purchaser action&#8221;). Since then, the Firm has entered into a revised settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated U.S. class action, including the exchange-based actions, and that agreement has been preliminarily approved by the Court. The District Court has dismissed one&#32;of the ERISA actions, and the plaintiffs have filed an appeal. The consumer action, a second ERISA action and the indirect purchaser action remain pending in the District Court.In September 2015, two&#32;class actions were filed in Canada against the Firm as well as a number of other FX dealers, principally for alleged violations of the Canadian Competition Act based on an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of currency purchased in the FX market. The first action was filed in the province of Ontario, and seeks to represent all persons in Canada who transacted any FX instrument. The second action was filed in the province of Quebec, and seeks authorization to represent only those persons in Quebec who engaged in FX transactions. In late 2016, the Firm settled the Canadian class actions, subject to Court approval. The Court in the Ontario action granted approval of that settlement in April 2017, and Court approval of the settlement of the Quebec action remains pending.General Motors Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion&#32;syndicated Term Loan facility (&#8220;Term Loan&#8221;) for General Motors Corporation (&#8220;GM&#8221;).&#160;In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy 142proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (&#8220;Creditors Committee&#8221;) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In January 2015, following several court proceedings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of the Creditors Committee's claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. The proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court continue with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan that was unaffected by the filing of the termination statement at issue. In connection with that additional collateral, a trial regarding the value of certain representative assets began in the Bankruptcy Court in April 2017. In addition, certain Term Loan lenders filed cross-claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the Bankruptcy Court seeking indemnification and asserting various claims.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The parties entered into an agreement to settle the cases for a cash payment of $6.1 billion&#32;to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm's share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten&#32;basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight&#32;months to be measured from a date within 60 days&#32;of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provided for modifications to each credit card network's rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. In December 2013, the District Court granted final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which, in June 2016, vacated the District Court's certification of the class action and reversed the approval of the class settlement. Both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed petitions seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court of the Second Circuit's decision, and those petitions were denied in March 2017. The case has been remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding.Investment Management Litigation. In April 2017, the Firm reached a settlement with Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited in two&#32;cases in which it was alleged that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan&#32;&#160;Investment Management were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and various state attorneys general, as well as the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;), the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), the Canadian Competition Bureau, the Swiss Competition Commission (&#8220;ComCo&#8221;) and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the BBA's London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Banking Federation (&#8220;EBF&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the EBF's Euro Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;) and to the Japanese Bankers' Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;TIBOR&#8221;), as well as processes for the setting of U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates and other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. As previously reported, the Firm has resolved EC inquiries relating to Yen LIBOR and Swiss Franc LIBOR. In December 2016, the Firm resolved ComCo inquiries relating to these same rates. ComCo's investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the EC issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal with the European General Court. In June 2016, the DOJ informed the Firm that the DOJ had closed its inquiry into LIBOR and other benchmark rates with respect to the Firm without taking action. Other inquiries have been discontinued without any action against JPMorgan Chase, including by the SEC, FCA and the Canadian Competition Bureau.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions filed in various United States District Courts. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, EURIBOR, Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;SIBOR&#8221;), Singapore Swap Offer Rate (&#8220;SOR&#8221;) and/or the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (&#8220;BBSW&#8221;) by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, EURIBOR, SIBOR, SOR or BBSW and assert a variety 143of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These matters are in various stages of litigation.The Firm has agreed to settle the putative class actions related to Yen LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR.&#160; Those settlements are subject to further documentation and approval by the Court.&#160;&#160;&#160;In the EURIBOR action, the District Court dismissed all claims except a single antitrust claim and two&#32;common law claims, and dismissed all defendants except the Firm and Citibank.In the U.S. dollar LIBOR-related actions, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including the antitrust claims, and permitted other claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law to proceed. In May 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the dismissal of the antitrust claims and remanded the case to the District Court to consider, among other things, whether the plaintiffs have standing to assert antitrust claims. In July 2016, JPMorgan Chase and other defendants again moved in the District Court to dismiss the antitrust claims, and in December 2016, the District Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion, finding that certain plaintiffs lacked standing to assert antitrust claims. The Firm is one&#32;of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. Plaintiffs primarily assert claims under the federal antitrust laws and Commodity Exchange Act. In April 2016, the Firm settled the ISDAFIX litigation, along with certain other banks. Those settlements have been preliminarily approved by the Court.Madoff Litigation. A putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., Madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested) in Madoff's Ponzi scheme and were not included in a prior class action settlement. These plaintiffs alleged violations of the federal securities law, as well as other state and federal claims. The New Jersey court granted a transfer motion to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The New York court granted the Firm's motion to dismiss, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has affirmed that dismissal. A similar action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, although it was not styled as a class action, and included claims pursuant to Florida statutes. The Florida court granted the Firm's motion to dismiss the case, and in August 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal. The plaintiffs have filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. In addition, the same plaintiffs have re-filed their dismissed state claims in Florida state court, where the Firm's motion to dismiss is pending. Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. The Firm and affiliates (together, &#8220;JPMC&#8221;), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, &#160;&#8220;Bear Stearns&#8221;) and certain Washington Mutual affiliates (together, &#8220;Washington Mutual&#8221;) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of MBS. The remaining civil cases include one&#32;investor action, one&#32;action by a monoline insurer relating to Bear Stearns' role solely as underwriter, and actions for repurchase of mortgage loans. The Firm and certain of its current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in a shareholder derivative action relating to the Firm's MBS activities, which remains pending.Issuer Litigation &#8211; Individual Purchaser Actions. With the exception of one&#32;remaining action, the Firm has resolved all of the individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings).Underwriter Actions. The Firm is defending one&#32;remaining action by a monoline insurer relating to Bear Stearns' role solely as underwriter for another issuer's MBS offering. The issuer is defunct.Repurchase Litigation. The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees, securities administrators and/or master servicers of various MBS trusts on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys' fees and costs and other remedies. The Firm has reached a settlement with Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) in connection with the litigation related to a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one&#32;or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation.In addition, the Firm and a group of 21&#32;institutional MBS investors made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion&#32;and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to 330&#32;MBS trusts created between 2005 and 2008. The offer does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. The trustees (or separate and successor trustees) for this group of 330&#32;trusts have accepted the settlement for 319&#32;trusts in whole or in part and excluded from the settlement 16&#32;trusts in whole or in part. The trustees' acceptance has received final approval from the court.Additional actions have been filed against third-party trustees that relate to loan repurchase and servicing claims involving trusts sponsored by JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of MBS trustees or entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable statute of limitations periods with respect to 144their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation.Derivative Action. A shareholder derivative action against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors relating to the Firm's MBS activities is pending in California federal court. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action.Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation. The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the DOJ's Criminal Division and two&#32;United States Attorney's Offices relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. In January 2017, a Consent Order was entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York resolving allegations by the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York that the Firm violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by giving pricing discretion to independent mortgage brokers in its wholesale lending origination channel which, according to the government's model, may have charged higher fees and interest rates to African-American and Hispanic borrowers than non-Hispanic White borrowers during the period between 2006 and 2009. The Firm denied liability, but agreed to pay a total of approximately $55 million&#32;to resolve this matter. In addition, three&#32;municipalities have commenced litigation against the Firm alleging violations of an unfair competition law or the Fair Housing Act. The municipalities seek, among other things, civil penalties for the unfair competition claim, and, for the Fair Housing Act claims, damages resulting from lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. Two&#32;of the municipal actions were stayed pending an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. On May 1, 2017, the Supreme Court held that the City of Miami has standing to bring claims under the Fair Housing Act, and remanded the case to the lower court to determine whether the City sufficiently alleged that the defendant's conduct proximately caused the alleged damages. The remaining municipal action is stayed pending an appeal by the City of Los Angeles to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the &#8220;County&#8221;) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion&#32;in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the &#8220;Plan of Adjustment&#8221;), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, &#160;the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment's effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Petters Bankruptcy and Related Matters. JPMorgan Chase and certain of its affiliates, including One Equity Partners (&#8220;OEP&#8221;), have been named as defendants in several actions filed in connection with the receivership and bankruptcy proceedings pertaining to Thomas J. Petters and certain affiliated entities (collectively, &#8220;Petters&#8221;) and the Polaroid Corporation. The principal actions against JPMorgan Chase and its affiliates have been brought by a court-appointed receiver for Petters and the trustees in bankruptcy proceedings for three&#32;Petters entities. These actions generally seek to avoid certain putative transfers in connection with (i) the 2005 acquisition by Petters of Polaroid, which at the time was majority-owned by OEP; (ii) two&#32;credit facilities that JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions entered into with Polaroid; and (iii) a credit line and investment accounts held by Petters. In January 2017, the Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss an amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, and defendants' motion for leave to appeal that decision is pending.Proprietary Products Investigations and Litigation.&#32;In December 2015, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to a settlement with the SEC, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. agreed to a settlement with the CFTC, regarding disclosures to clients concerning conflicts associated with the Firm's sale and use of proprietary products, such as J.P. Morgan mutual funds, in the Firm's CCB and AWM wealth management businesses, and the U.S. Private Bank's disclosures concerning the use of hedge funds that pay placement agent fees to JPMorgan Chase broker-dealer affiliates. The Firm settled with an additional government authority in July 2016, and continues to cooperate with inquiries from other government authorities concerning disclosure of conflicts associated with the Firm's sale and use of proprietary products. A putative class action, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of financial advisory clients from 2007 to the present whose funds were invested in proprietary funds and who were charged investment management fees, was dismissed by the Court. The dismissal has been affirmed on appeal.Referral Hiring Practices Investigations.&#32;In November 2016, the Firm entered into settlements with DOJ, the SEC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) to resolve those agencies' respective investigations relating to a former hiring program for 145candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. Other related investigations are ongoing, and the Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations.Washington Mutual Litigations. Proceedings related to Washington Mutual's failure are pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and include a lawsuit brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, initially against the FDIC and amended to include JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a defendant, asserting an estimated $6 billion&#32;to $10 billion&#32;in damages based upon alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with mortgage securitization agreements. The case includes assertions that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may have assumed liabilities for the alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the mortgage securitization agreements. In June 2015, the court ruled in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on the question of whether the Firm or the FDIC bears responsibility for Washington Mutual Bank's repurchase obligations, holding that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. assumed only those liabilities that were reflected on Washington Mutual Bank's financial accounting records as of September 25, 2008, and only up to the amount of the book value reflected therein. The FDIC has appealed that ruling.JPMorgan Chase has also filed complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDIC, in its corporate capacity as well as in its capacity as receiver for Washington Mutual Bank, asserting multiple claims for indemnification under the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the FDIC relating to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s purchase of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Washington Mutual Bank (the &#8220;Purchase & Assumption Agreement&#8221;).The Firm, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and the FDIC have signed a settlement agreement to resolve (i) pending litigation brought by Deutsche Bank National Trust Company against the FDIC and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as defendants, relating to alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties given by certain Washington Mutual affiliates in connection with mortgage securitization agreements and (ii) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s outstanding indemnification claims pursuant to the terms of the Purchase & Assumption Agreement. The settlement is subject to certain judicial approval procedures, and both matters are stayed pending approval of the settlement.Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (&#8220;Wendel&#8221;) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi&#32;on November 30, 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French &#160;tribunal correctionnel&#32;for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. The Firm has been successful in legal challenges made to the Court of Cassation, France's highest court, which have been referred back to and remain pending before the Paris Court of Appeal. In addition, civil proceedings have been commenced against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. by a number of the managers. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.* * *In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management's best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm's legal expense was $218 million&#32;for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2017&#32;and was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2016. There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigation reserves, that the legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period. 146Note 23&#32;&#8211; Business segmentsThe Firm is managed on a line of business basis. There are four&#32;major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these lines of business are presented on a managed basis. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase's business segments, see Segment results below, and Note 33&#32;of JPMorgan Chase's 2016&#32;Annual Report.Segment resultsThe following table provides a summary of the Firm's segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, on a managed basis. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on a FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities.&#32;This allows management to assess the comparability of &#160;revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity. On at least an annual basis, the Firm assesses the level of capital required for each line of business as well as the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital. Through the end of 2016, capital was allocated to the lines of business based on a single measure, Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA. Effective January 1, 2017, the Firm's methodology used to allocate capital to the business segments was updated.&#160;The new methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized Fully Phased-In RWA (as well as Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA), leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. The methodology will continue to be weighted towards Basel III Advanced Fully Phased-In RWA because the Firm believes it to be the best proxy for economic risk. In addition, under the new methodology, capital is no longer allocated to each line of business for goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquisitions effected by the line of business.&#32;&#32;147Note 24&#32;&#8211; Business changes and developmentsStudent loan portfolio transferDuring the first quarter of 2017, the Firm transferred the student loan portfolio to held-for-sale, resulting in a writedown of the portfolio to the estimated fair value at the time of the transfer. This write-down was recognized predominantly as a $467 million&#32;charge-off, resulting in a $218 million&#32;increase in the provision for credit losses after utilization of the allowance for loan losses of $249 million. The transfer impacted certain loan and credit-related metrics, including net charge-offs, net charge-off rates and the allowance for loan losses.Subsequent to March 31, 2017, the Firm entered into an agreement to sell the student loan portfolio. The carrying value of the student loan portfolio was $6.3 billion&#32;as of March 31, 2017. The sale is scheduled to close over the next several months and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.148Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of March 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm's management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.&#160;We previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 28, 2017, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2016, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.May 2, 2017PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017149150<hr
