Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEWbp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.Financial Highlights &#150;Reported Basis: Reported net income for J.P.&nbsp;MorganChase&nbsp;&&nbsp;Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;) was $40&nbsp;million, or $0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2002compared with $1,028&nbsp;million, or $0.50 per share, in the second quarter of2002 and $449&nbsp;million, or $0.22 per share, in the third quarter of 2001. Forthe first nine months of 2002, reported net income was $2,050&nbsp;million, or$1.00 per share, compared with $2,026&nbsp;million, or $0.97 per share, in the sameperiod last year.Total revenue of $6.9&nbsp;billion in the third quarter of 2002 was down 8% versusthe immediately preceding quarter and 6% below the third quarter of last year.These declines were primarily the result of weak trading results in achallenging market environment, as well as the seasonal slowdown in clientflow. This was partially offset by the continued strong results of the retailbusinesses, particularly the mortgage business.Total noninterest expenses of $5.1&nbsp;billion in the third quarter of 2002declined from both the 2002 second quarter and 2001 third quarter. The declineof 16% from the third quarter of last year was attributable to lower mergerand restructuring expenses, lower compensation expenses as a result oflayoffs, lower incentives in response to lower earnings, and theimplementation of other expense management initiatives. In addition, thecurrent quarter, in comparison with the 2001 third quarter, reflected theeffect of the adoption of SFAS 142, which eliminated the amortization ofgoodwill. On a year-to-date basis, total expense of $15.6&nbsp;billion in 2002 was13% lower than last year, reflecting the same factors.Provision for credit losses for the 2002 third quarter was up 124% from thesecond quarter of this year and 146% above the third quarter of 2001reflecting higher commercial net charge-offs and a provision in excess ofcharge-offs in the amount of $570&nbsp;million. The provision included $292&nbsp;millionfor losses in lending-related commitments. The significant increase incommercial net charge-offs was primarily attributable to companies in thetelecommunications and related sectors and, to a lesser extent, the cablesector. The increase in the provision, when compared with the 2001 thirdquarter, was also affected by the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust inFebruary 2002. For the first nine months of this year, the provision of $3.4billion was 99% higher than last year's equivalent nine-month period,reflecting the increase in commercial net charge-offs and the effect of theProvidian Master Trust acquisition.Summary of Segment Results: In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on areported basis, management utilizes &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of itsbusiness segments. For additional information and a reconciliation between theFirm's reported and operating results see pages 29-30 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.Operating results for the 2002 third quarter were significantly below the 2002second quarter and 2001 third quarter. Operating earnings were $325&nbsp;million inthe third quarter 2002, compared with $1,179&nbsp;million in the second quarter of2002 and $1,133&nbsp;million one year ago. Operating earnings for 2001 have beenadjusted by adding back amortization of goodwill to present 2001 results on abasis comparable with the results for 2002, which include the impact of theimplementation on January&nbsp;1, 2002 of SFAS 142.21 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Total assets as of September&nbsp;30, 2002 were $742&nbsp;billion, compared with $741billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2002 and $694&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001. JPMorganChase's Tier 1 Capital ratio was 8.7% at September&nbsp;30, 2002 and 8.3% atDecember&nbsp;31, 2001. On September&nbsp;17, 2002, the Board of Directors declared its intentionto continue the current quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share on the Firm'soutstanding common stock, provided that capital ratios remain strong andearnings prospects exceed the current dividend.The Firm remains committed to its diversified business model and theexecution of its long-term strategy. In responding to the difficultenvironment, the Firm continues to examine opportunities to improveperformance, control expenses, manage prudently its capital and liquidity,and improve its risk management practices.To improve financial performance under current market conditions, theInvestment Bank announced in October 2002 a series of initiatives to improveefficiency as well as enable selective strategic investments. Theseinitiatives, which will begin in the fourth quarter, are expected togenerate approximately $700&nbsp;million of savings and result in a reduction instaffing levels of over 2,000 as well as a reduction in consultants employedby the Firm. Severance and other restructuring costs related to theseinitiatives are estimated to be approximately $450&nbsp;million withapproximately $300&nbsp;million to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 andthe remainder in 2003. For additionalinformation, see page 34 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q. Initiatives are also underway to improve the Firm'sefficiency in technology, finance management and other support units. Inaddition, the Firm continues to adjust its credit practices by imposingtighter concentration limits on borrowers and industries.22 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations.RevenuesInvestment Banking FeesInvestment banking fees of $545&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2002 declinedover 30% from both the 2001 third quarter and the 2002 second quarter. Thedeclines reflected the industry-wide prolonged weakness in demand for mergersand acquisitions (&#147;M&A&#148;) advisory services and for stock and bond offerings.Advisory revenues in the third quarter of 2002 were $143&nbsp;million, a decline of57% from the third quarter of 2001 and 24% from the second quarter of thisyear. Underwriting and Other fees of $402&nbsp;million were 17% lower than the sameperiod a year ago and 33% lower than the second quarter of 2002. (Foradditional information on investment banking fees, see the Investment Banksegment discussion on page 32.)For the first nine months of 2002, investment banking fees of $2.1&nbsp;billion weredown 22% from last year. The decline was due to the industry-wide weakness inM&A and capital markets. Advisory revenues for the first nine months of $523million were down 46% from last year. Underwriting and Other fees of $1.6billion were down 8% from last year primarily due to weakness in debtunderwriting.At the end of September 2002, the pipeline for investment banking activitieswas approximately 6% below the level at the end of the second quarter of2002, with the pipeline for M&A and equity underwriting down 10% and20%, respectively. These unfavorable conditions were partly offset by theincrease in the pipeline for bond underwriting and loan syndication, which isup 10% from the second quarter of 2002. The Firm believes the near-term outlook forcapital markets remains uncertain.Investment Banking FeesTrading RevenueTrading revenues were negative$21&nbsp;million in the 2002 third quarter, compared with tradinggains of $731&nbsp;million and $1,301&nbsp;million in the secondquarter of 2002 and third quarter of 2001, respectively. The lower results were due to equity trading losses, lower results infixed income trading and a seasonal slowdown of client flow, compared with thesecond quarter.For the first nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, trading revenue of $2.0billion was down 56% from last year. Fixed income and other results of $1.7billion were down 46% reflecting weakness in interest rate trading. Equitiestrading results of $314&nbsp;million were down 78% primarily due to lower results inequity derivatives.Beginning in 2001, bid and offer prices on NASDAQ stocks began to be quoted indollars and cents instead of fractions of whole dollars. As a result, in 2002,the Firm began to negotiate with institutional clients commission-basedpricing structures that would support the costs of delivering enhancedbrokerage services to these clients in connection with effecting theirNASDAQ-market trades. Prior to this change, revenues earned on a spreadbetween bid and offer prices were recorded in &#147;Trading Revenues&#148;; revenuesearned from agreed-upon commissions are now recorded in the &#147;Brokerage andInvestment Services Fees&#148; category.23 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Fees and CommissionsFees and commissions of $3.0&nbsp;billion for the third quarter of 2002 increased25% from the third quarter of 2001 and 4% from the second quarter of 2002. Forthe first nine months of 2002, fees and commissions rose 21% from thecomparable period of 2001. The table below provides the significant componentsof fees and commissions:Investment Management, Custodyand Processing ServicesInvestment management, custody and processing services fees declined 4% and 6%from the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of 2002,respectively. The investment management fee component of this categorydecreased 4% from the 2001 third quarter and prior quarter of this year. Thedeclines were due to the lower value of equity-related assets under management,as well as the general slowdown in investor activity.Custody and processing services decreased 8% from the second quarter of 2002,partly reflecting the seasonal decline in securities lending volume. The secondquarter is traditionally more profitable for the securities lending business asseveral overseas companies pay their annual or semi-annual dividends duringthis quarter; the dividend payout triggers an increase in market activity inthe shares of these overseas companies. Also contributing to the decrease inthe third quarter of 2002 was the weak market environment, which adverselyaffected the value of securities under safekeeping. (For additionalinformation, see the Investment Management & Private Banking and the Treasury &Securities Services segment discussions on pages 39 and 34, respectively.)Credit Card RevenueCredit card revenue rose 47% from the third quarter of 2001 and 20% from thesecond quarter of 2002. The increase over the 2001 third quarter wasattributable to the higher servicing fees associated with the almost $10billion growth in the servicing portfolio. Growth in the servicing portfoliowas primarily driven by the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust portfolioin February 2002. For a discussion of the treatment of the accounting forsecuritizations, see page 29.Brokerage and InvestmentServicesIn the third quarter of 2002, brokerage and investment services rose 20% fromthe 2001 third quarter but declined 4% from the 2002 second quarter. Theincrease from last year was attributable to the impact of more NASDAQ-markettrades being executed in 2002 on a commission basis rather than based onbid/offer spread. (For further information, see the Trading Revenue discussionon page 23.)24 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Mortgage Servicing FeesMortgage servicing fees of $323&nbsp;million in the 2002 third quarter increasedconsiderably from both the 2001 third quarter and the second quarter of thisyear. The Firm offsets the interest rate risk in its mortgage servicing rightsasset by designating certain interest rate derivatives as fair value hedges.The results of these hedges and the adjustments of the carrying value of theMSRs under SFAS 133 are recorded in mortgage servicing fees. See Note 9 on page15 of this Form10-Q. During the third quarter of 2002, gains on derivatives used to hedgemortgage servicing rights significantly offset decreases in the value of theasset. On a year-to-date basis, the increase of $777&nbsp;million in mortgageservicing fees from the prior year also reflected the favorable impact of theFirm's risk management activities. Also contributing to the increase from last yearwas the growth in servicing balances. At September&nbsp;30, 2002, the balance ofmortgages serviced at Home Finance stood at $435&nbsp;billion compared with $427billion at September&nbsp;30, 2001 and $436&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002.Deposit Service ChargesDeposit service charges in the third quarter of 2002 increased 10% from thethird quarter of 2001 and 5% from the second quarter of 2002. The increasesresulted from the lower interest rate environment, which reduced the value ofcustomers' compensating deposit balances, and consequently increased the feesthey paid for deposit services. On a year-to-date basis, the increase of 14%from last year was driven by the effect of the lower interest rate environment,as well as higher transaction volume on the accounts of institutionalcustomers.Other FeesOther fees of $216&nbsp;million in the2002 third quarter were down slightly from last year'sthird quarter and 11% from the 2002 second quarter. The decline from the 2002 second quarter reflectedlower insurance commissions partly due to a decline in the volume of variableannuity sales.Private Equity GainsThe private equity investments of the Firm resulted in a net loss of $315million in the third quarter of 2002, compared with the loss of $107&nbsp;millionrecorded during the third quarter of last year and the loss of $125&nbsp;million inthe second quarter of this year. The results of the third quarter of 2002reflected net mark-to-market losses on public securities, as well aswrite-downs and write-offs on private holdings, particularly in telecom andtechnology investments.The private equity markets continued to be weak in the third quarter, withlimited exit opportunities and constrained financing. The outlook for the restof the year indicates a continuation of the difficult market environment; thatis, few initial public offerings, limited availability of high-yieldfinancing, and slow merger and acquisition activities. (For a furtherdiscussion of the Firm's private equity results, see the JPMP line of businessresults on page 40 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.) The table below provides a comparisonwith prior periods of realized and unrealized gains and losses.25 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Securities GainsSecurities gains of $578&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2002 were upsubstantially from the same period a year earlier and the immediatelypreceding quarter of this year. Included in these gains were $465&nbsp;millionattributable to the Investment Bank, which manages the Firm's interest rateexposures and investment securities activities. Global treasury's activitiescomplement and offer a strategic balance and diversification benefit to theFirm's trading activities. Also included were $107&nbsp;million of gains realizedfrom Home Finance's investment securities portfolio. Securitiesavailable-for-sale are held by Home Finance to hedge the value of mortgageservicing rights on its balance sheet. During the first nine months of 2002,the value of the available-for-sale securities at Home Finance rose steadilyas a result of declining rates during this period.Other RevenueThe increase in revenue over prior periods relating to residential mortgageorigination and sales activities is due to the significant growth in loanapplications and originations, primarily from the direct-to-consumer products.This level of origination activity resulted in a higher volume of loan salesand securitization. (For additional information on mortgage-related revenue,see the Retail & Middle Market Financial Services segment discussion on page 35and Note 8 on page 13.)All other revenue of $206&nbsp;million increased significantly from the thirdquarter of 2001 and was up 41% from the second quarter this year. The thirdquarter of 2002 included a gain of approximately $50&nbsp;million on the sale of theFirm's interest in CEDEL, a company that clears foreign security transactions,and $20&nbsp;million received as a result of the forfeiture by theCity of New York of escrow deposits dueto the City's cancellation of the 15 Broad/23 Wall Street purchase. In the thirdquarter of this year, New York City decided not to purchase the JPMorgan Chaseproperty at 15 Broad/23 Wall Street that had been planned to house the New York StockExchange. The 2001 third quarter included unfavorable fair value adjustmentsrelated to loan positions held by the Firm after the syndication period hadended, partly offset by a gain of $27&nbsp;million on the sale of a commercialmortgage servicing portfolio. The year-to-date increase of 23% also reflectedgains from higher volumes of credit card securitizations and write-downs of $73million on certain Latin American investments. Gains were recognized in 2001 onthe sale of other nonstrategic businesses in Texas (totaling $48&nbsp;million) andretail properties in New York ($26&nbsp;million).Net Interest IncomeNet interest income of $2.7&nbsp;billion in the third quarter of 2002 remainedrelatively stable in comparison with the 2001 third quarter and 2002 secondquarter. Net interest income for the first nine months of 2002 rose 9% from ayear ago. The increase resulted from the favorable effect of the low interestrates and wider spreads on interest-earning assets. Low interest rates alsocontributed to an increase in originations of consumer-related lending,particularly credit card receivables and auto loans. The growth in credit cardswas also due to the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust portfolio inFebruary of 2002. This growth in interest-earning assets was partly offset bythe higher average volume of credit card securitizations in the currentquarter, up $10&nbsp;billion from the equivalent quarter of a year ago, and $3billion from the immediately preceding quarter.As a component of net interest income,the third quarter of 2002 included $386&nbsp;million oftrading-related net interest income. This level was relatively flatwhen compared with the second quarter of this year, but 23% higherthan the third quarter of 2001. The increase from last year wasprimarily attributable to higher spreads on the trading-relatedassets.NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal noninterest expense for the quarter was $5.1&nbsp;billion, down 16% from thethird quarter of 2001 and slightly below the second quarter of this year. Thedecline from the 2001 third quarter was due to lower merger and restructuringcosts related to actions announced before 2002, and to expense containmentprograms implemented in response to the weak market environment. Alsocontributing to the decline was the cessation of the amortization of goodwillas a result of the adoption of SFAS 142. These factors were partially offset byincremental expenses related to the Providian Master Trust acquisition andseverance costs related to recently announced layoff programs. The followingtable presents the components of noninterest expense.26 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)ExpensesCompensation ExpenseCompensation expense in the third quarter of 2002 was $2.4&nbsp;billion, down 17%from last year's third quarter and 14% lower than the 2002 second quarter. Thedeclines were the result of the alignment of incentives with the decrease inearnings as well as reduction in the number of full-time equivalent employeesin businesses affected by the slowdown in the economy, particularly theInvestment Bank, and to a lesser degree, Investment Management & PrivateBanking. The third quarter of 2002 also included a $67&nbsp;million reversal ofpreviously accrued expenses associated with restricted stock issued underemployee benefit plans that contained stock price targets, which are unlikelyto be attained within the required time frames specified under the terms ofthe awards. These reversals have totaled $120&nbsp;million year to date.These favorable items were partially offset by the impact of annual salaryincreases and new employees hired at expanding business segments, primarilyRetail & Middle Market Financial Services and Treasury & Securities Services. Employee benefit costs rose slightly due tonew employees at expanding businesses enrolling in benefit programs in additionto costs related to separated employees. Compensation expense in 2002included severance costs of $78&nbsp;million in the third quarter and $97&nbsp;million inthe second quarter. These costs were primarily associated with the reduction inhead count at the Investment Bank. (In 2002, severance costs associated withexpense management initiatives undertaken in 2002 are recorded in compensationexpense, whereas in 2001, those related to merger and other previouslyannounced restructuring programs were recorded within therestructuring line.)The Firm had 95,637 full-time equivalent employees at September&nbsp;30, 2002,compared with 96,633 at September&nbsp;30, 2001 and 95,878 at June&nbsp;30, 2002. Thedecrease in the number of employees was attributable to reductions at theInvestment Bank, Investment Management & Private Banking and Corporate andSupport business segments, offset by increases at Retail & Middle MarketFinancial Services and Treasury & Securities Services.Occupancy ExpenseOccupancy expense in the 2002 third quarter rose 41% from the third quarter of2001 and 31% from the second quarter of this year. The principal reason for thesignificant increases was the establishment of a $98&nbsp;millioncharge for excesscapacity related to facilities on the west coast of the United States,principally in the San Francisco area. Excluding the impact of this charge,which the Firm characterized as nonoperating expense, occupancy costs would havebeen only slightly higher than the prior quarter and 12% above the same quarterof last year. The increases reflected the costs of additional leased spaces inmidtown Manhattan and New Jersey. Since the beginning of this year, staff thathad been previously located in downtown Manhattan were relocated to these newsites. Also contributing to the increases were higher utilities and cleaningservices expense and the termination of a license agreement with the City ofNew York for 15 Broad/23 Wall Street under which the City had paid a fee forthe building to be temporarily occupied by a company displaced by the events ofSeptember&nbsp;11, 2001. The Firm had contracted to sell this property to the Cityfor a new New York Stock Exchange facility. During the third quarter,the City also decided toterminate that contract, resulting in a one-time paymentto the Firm of $20&nbsp;million which is recorded in Other Revenue.Technology and Communications ExpenseIn the third quarter of 2002, technology and communications expense of $625million declined slightly from both the second quarter of this year and the2001 third quarter. The declines reflected the impact of expense managementinitiatives, which resulted in lower purchased software and other technologyand equipment-related expenses. These items were partially offset by higheramortization of capitalized software assets.Merger and Restructuring CostsIn the third quarter of 2002, merger and restructuring costs were $333&nbsp;million,down 62% from the 2001 third quarter and 45% higher than the second quarter ofthis year. Refer to the discussion of compensation expense above for adescription of other severance costs incurred in 2002 and to Note 5 of thisForm&nbsp;10-Q and page 44 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.27 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Amortization of IntangiblesAmortization of intangibles declined 56% from last year's third quarter and was13% lower than the 2002 second quarter. The decline from last year primarilyreflected the implementation of SFAS 142, which now requires a periodic reviewof goodwill for impairment rather than the amortization of goodwill, as was thecase last year. This was partly offset by the impact of the acquisition inFebruary 2002 of the Providian Master Trust's credit card relationshipintangibles. In 2002, there were no impairments recognized on goodwill recordedon the balance sheet. The decline from the 2002 second quarter was attributableto a second quarter $12&nbsp;million impairment write-down of purchased credit cardrelationship intangibles related to a small credit card portfolio previouslyacquired. (For a further discussion of the amortization of intangibles and theexpected level of expense for the remainder of the year, see Note 2 of thisForm&nbsp;10-Q.)Other ExpenseIn the third quarter of 2002, other expense rose slightly from both of the 2001third quarter and the 2002 second quarter. The following table presents thecomponents of other expense:PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSESProvision for credit losses increasedsignificantly from the 2002 second quarter and 2001 third quarterbecause of higher commercial credit costs. The provision in the 2002third quarter reflected highercharge-offs, primarily in the telecom and cable sectors, and additions to theallowance for credit losses. Includedin the 2002 third quarter is a $292&nbsp;million provision for lending-relatedcommitments. In the third quarter of 2002, the provision for lending-relatedcommitments was reclassified from other revenue to provision for credit losses.Immaterial prior period amounts have been reclassified. (See pages 44-49 for adiscussion of charge-offs associated with the commercial and consumer loanportfolios and pages 49-51 for a discussion of the allowance for creditlosses.)INCOME TAXESIn the third quarter of 2002, JPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of$20&nbsp;million, compared with $220&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001. For thefirst nine months of 2002, JPMorgan Chase recorded income tax expense of$1,056&nbsp;million, compared with $1,083&nbsp;million for the first nine months of2001. The effective tax rate was 34% in the third quarter and in the firstnine months of 2002, compared with 33% and 35% in the third quarter of 2001and first nine months of 2001, respectively.28 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)SEGMENT RESULTSThe Firm prepares its financial statements using U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The financial statements prepared inaccordance with GAAP appear on pages 3-6 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q. That presentation,which is referred to as &#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the reader with anunderstanding of the Firm's results that can be consistently tracked from yearto year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with othercompanies' GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementutilizes &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of its businesses and to measureoverall Firm results against targeted goals. The definition of operatingbasis starts with the reported GAAP results and then excludes the impact ofmerger and restructuring costs and special items, which managementcurrently defines assignificant nonrecurring gains or losses of $75&nbsp;million ormore. Both restructuring charges and special items are viewed by managementas transactions that are not part of the Firm's normal daily businessoperations or are unusual in nature and are therefore not indicative oftrends. Operating results in 2002 include the severance and related costsassociated with management actions in 2002 in light of slower marketactivity. Operating results in the 2002 third quarter and nine monthsexcluded $333&nbsp;million and $817&nbsp;million (pre-tax) in merger and restructuringcosts, respectively. Also excluded from operating results in the thirdquarter of this year was a $98&nbsp;million (pre-tax) charge for excess realestate capacity related to facilities in the west coast of the UnitedStates. This charge was recorded in &#147;Occupancy Expense&#148; in the reportedresults. Merger and restructuring costs through the first nine months of2002 were $817&nbsp;million and are in line with full year targeted expenses of$1.2&nbsp;billion. The 2001 third quarter and nine months merger andrestructuring costs were $876&nbsp;million and $1,682&nbsp;million (pre-tax),respectively. The first nine months of 2001 also included the cumulativeeffect of a transition adjustment of $(25)&nbsp;million (after-tax) related to theadoption of SFAS 133.Operating results also exclude the impact of credit card securitizations.JPMorgan Chase periodically securitizes a portion of its credit card portfolioby selling a pool of credit card receivables to a trust, which issuessecurities to investors. When credit card receivables are securitized, theFirm ceases to accrue interest and credit costs on the receivables and,instead, receives fee revenue for continuing to service those receivables andfee revenue representing any interest and fees on the receivables in excess ofthe interest paid to investors, net credit losses and servicing fees. As aresult, securitization does not affect JPMorgan Chase's reported or operatingnet income; however, it does affect the classification of items in theConsolidated Statement of Income. The Firm also reports credit costs on a&#147;managed&#148; or &#147;operating&#148; basis. Credit costs on an operating basis arecomposed of the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement ofIncome (which includes a provision for credit card receivables on theConsolidated Balance Sheet) as well as the credit costs associated withsecuritized credit card loans. Credit costs for securitized loans are for theaccount of the Firm as the holder of the residual interest in thesecuritization trust. In the Firm's GAAP financial statements, credit costsassociated with securitized credit card loans reduces the noninterest incomeremitted to the Firm from the trust. This income is reported in credit cardrevenue in Fees and Commissions over the life of the securitization.In 2001, the methodology for allocating the allowance (and provision) forcredit losses to the business segments was changed. The Firm currently has amethodology whereby each business is responsible for its credit costs, whichincludes actual net charge-offs and changes in the specific and expectedcomponents of the allowance for loan losses. Minor refinements to theallocation of the allowance are continuing in 2002. The residual component ofthe allowance for loan losses, while available for losses at any businesssegment, is maintained at the corporate level.29 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following summary table provides a reconciliation between the Firm'sreported and operating results:30 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's segment results reflect the manner in which financialinformation currently is evaluated by the Firm's management. Adjustments maybe made from time to time to reflect changes in methodologies or reportinglines. For a discussion of the Firm's methodology of allocating equity to itsbusiness units, see page 29 of the 2001 Annual Report. The table belowprovides summary financial information on an operating basis for the fivemajor business segments.Summary of Segment ResultsOperating RevenueOperating Earnings31 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the Investment Bank, see pages30-31 of the JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of the Investment Bank:bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals1%.NM &#151; Not meaningful.BUSINESS REVENUE:NM &#151; Notmeaningful.The Investment Bank had an operating loss of $256&nbsp;million in the third quarter,compared with operating earnings of $486&nbsp;million in the second quarter and $702million in the third quarter of 2001. The operating loss for the quarter wasdriven by significantly higher credit costs and lower revenues, compared withprior quarters. For the first nine months of 2002, earnings for the InvestmentBank were $983&nbsp;million, down 61% from last year, reflecting a lower operatingmargin from reduced revenue coupled with higher credit costs.32 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating revenues of $2.43&nbsp;billion in the third quarter were 21% lower thanlast quarter and down 31% from the third quarter of 2001. For the first ninemonths of 2002, revenues of $9.14&nbsp;billion were 21% below last year due to lowertrading revenues and investment banking fees.Investment Banking fees of $533&nbsp;million decreased 32% from the second quarterand were down 34% from the third quarter of 2001. The decrease reflectsindustry-wide weakness in both M&A activity and underwriting volumes in theequity and debt markets. Advisory revenues were down 28% and 58% from thesecond quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of 2001, respectively. Underwriting and other fees were down 34% fromthe second quarter and down 18% from the third quarter of 2001, driven byweakness in equity underwriting activity. The Firm maintained its #2 ranking inunderwriting U.S. investment grade bonds.1 For thefirst nine months of 2002, the Investment Bank improved its ranking to #4 inglobal announced M&A with a market share of 16%, including a #1 ranking inEuropean announced M&A.1 For the first nine months of 2002, advisory revenueswere down 46% from last year. For the first nine months of 2002,underwriting and other fees were down 9% from last year.The Investment Bank evaluates its capital markets activities, which includessales and trading, treasury and corporate lending activities by considering allrevenues related to these activities. These revenues include trading, fees andcommissions, securities gains and related net interest income and otherrevenues. In addition, these activities are managed on a total return revenuebasis, which includes operating revenues plus the unrealized gains or losses onthird-party or internally transfer priced assets and liabilities in activities, primarily treasury, which are notaccounted for on a mark-to-market basis through earnings.Capital Markets total return revenues were $1.7&nbsp;billion, down 28% from boththe second quarter and from third quarter of 2001. Fixed income total returnrevenues of $1.3&nbsp;billion decreased 23% from the second quarter and 30% fromthe third quarter of 2001 primarily from weakness in interest rate trading indifficult market conditions and seasonally lower client flow, compared withthe second quarter. Partially offsetting this decline was the strongperformance of global treasury, which manages the Firm's interest rateexposures and investment securities activities. Global treasury's total returnrevenues of $363&nbsp;million were up 70% from the second quarter. Globaltreasury's activities complement and offer a strategic balance anddiversification benefit to the Firm's trading activities. The decline inequities was due to losses in trading positions in equity derivatives,convertibles and cash securities. For the first nine months of 2002, CapitalMarkets total return revenues were $6.9&nbsp;billion, down 19% from last year dueto lower trading results in fixed income and equities partially offset bystronger results in treasury. On an operating revenue basis, Capital Marketsrevenues of $1.9&nbsp;billion in the third quarter were 18% below the secondquarter and 30% below the third quarter of 2001. For the first nine months of2002, Capital Markets operating revenues were $7.1&nbsp;billion, down 21% from lastyear.Reconciliation of Capital Markets Revenues to Financial Statement Line ItemsCredit costs were $1.32&nbsp;billion for the quarter, up from $306&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter and $268&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001. The increaseincludes significantly higher charge-offs, primarily in the telecommunicationand cable sectors, and a provision in excess of charge-offs for loans andlending-related off-balance sheet commitments. On a year-to-date basis, creditcosts were $1.90&nbsp;billion, up from $530&nbsp;million last year.Operating expenses for the third quarter of $1.65&nbsp;billion decreased by 19%from the second quarter and by 23% from the third quarter of 2001. The declinereflects lower incentive compensation expense as a result of the weakoperating performance. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2002included severance and related costs of $79&nbsp;million compared with $123&nbsp;millionin the second quarter and none in the third quarter of last year. Includingthese severance and related costs, the overhead ratio for the third quarterwas 68%, compared with 65% in the second quarter and 61% in the third quarterof 2001.33 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Excluding these costs the overhead ratio for the quarter was 64%, comparedwith 61% in both the second quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of 2001. Forthe first nine months of 2002, operating expenses were $5.78&nbsp;billion, down 17%from last year. Operating expenses for the first nine months of 2002 includedseverance and related costs of $250&nbsp;million compared with none last year. On ayear-to-date basis, including severance and related costs, the overhead ratiowas 63% compared with 60% last year. Excluding these costs the overhead ratiowas 61% compared with 60% last year.In October 2002, the Investment Bank completed a review of all majorbusinesses. The conclusions underscore the value of the Firm's integratedbusiness model, the breadth of its product offerings and the strength of theclient franchise. To improve financial performance under current marketconditions, the Investment Bank announced a series of initiatives to improveefficiency as well as enable selective strategic investments. Theseinitiatives, which will begin in the fourth quarter, are expected to generateapproximately $700&nbsp;million of savings and result in a reduction in staffinglevels of over 2,000 as well as a reduction in consultants employed by theFirm. Severance and other restructuring costs related to these initiativesare estimated to be approximately $450&nbsp;million with approximately $300million to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 and the remainder in2003. In a revenue environment similar to 2002, these initiatives will enablethe Investment Bank to target a return on equity of 12% in 2003. The majorinitiatives are:TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within Treasury &Securities Services (&#147;T&SS&#148;), see pages 32-33 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 AnnualReport. The following table sets forth selected financial data of Treasury &Securities Services:34 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Treasury & Securities Services had record operating earnings of $212&nbsp;million,an increase of 22% from the second quarter of 2002 and 23% from the thirdquarter of 2001. Operating Return on Common Equity (&#147;ROE&#148;) for the quarter was28%, compared with 23% in the second quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of2001.Operating revenues were $1,022&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2002, up 4% fromthe second quarter and up 5% from the third quarter of 2001, substantially dueto a gain of approximately $50&nbsp;million on the sale of CEDEL which is recordedin all other revenue above. Institutional Trust revenues were flat to thesecond quarter of 2002 and 16% higher than the third quarter of 2001. Theincrease from the prior year reflected the impact of acquisitions and newbusiness wins. Investor Services revenues were down 8% from the second quarterof 2002 due to the traditional increase in business volume during the secondquarter dividend season, which is driven by overseas companies paying annual orsemi-annual dividends. See page 24 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q for a further discussion.Revenues were down 9% from the third quarter of 2001 primarily due tosignificantly higher deposit balances in 2001 following September&nbsp;11th asclients looked to depository institutions to hold their cash funds. Alsocontributing to the decline were lower spreads on foreign exchange andsecurities lending resulting from the weak market environment. Revenues inTreasury Services were up 8% from the second quarter of 2002 and 3% from thethird quarter of 2001 due to higher product revenue resulting from increasedvolume and new initiatives, coupled with higher revenue pertaining to increasedbalance deficiency fees.Operating expenses decreased 3% from the second quarter of 2002 and 1% fromthe third quarter of 2001. T&SS continues to focus on cost containment andimproving its overhead ratio while selectively investing in acquisitions forfuture growth. The overhead ratio for the third quarter was 68%, compared with73% in the second quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of 2001. Excluding theeffects of the gain on CEDEL and the write-off of software (see Other Expenseon page 28), the overhead ratio for the third quarter of 2002 would have been70%.RETAIL & MIDDLE MARKET FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of Retail & Middle Market Financial Services (&#147;RMMFS&#148;) and adiscussion of the profiles for each business, see pages 38-40 of JPMorganChase's 2001 Annual Report. The following table reflects selected financialdata for RMMFS:Retail & Middle Market Financial Services had a third consecutive quarter ofrecord revenues and operating earnings. Operating earnings of $807&nbsp;million wereup 16% from the second quarter and up 92% from the third quarter of 2001. Forthe nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, operating earnings of $2.03&nbsp;billionwere up 63% from the same period last year. ROE for the third quarter was 30%,compared with 27% last quarter and 18% for the third quarter of 2001. On ayear-to-date basis, ROE was 26% compared with 18% a year ago.Operating revenues of $3.73&nbsp;billion were up 8% from the second quarter and 31%from the third quarter of 2001 driven by continued high production volumesacross all consumer credit businesses and low interest rates. Home Financerevenues were up 108% over the prior year and were driven by strong mortgageoriginations and gains on the hedging of mortgage servicing rights. InCardmember Services, managed credit card outstandings increased 31% fromSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001 to $51.1&nbsp;billion due to the acquisition of the ProvidianMaster Trust in the first quarter of 2002 and organic growth. There were closeto 900,000 new accounts originated during the quarter, the eighth consecutivequarter of additions at this level. Total average deposits grew 14% from thethird quarter of 2001. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, operatingrevenues were $10.32&nbsp;billion or 26% higher from the same period last year. Thiswas primarily due to 28% growth in average managed credit card outstandings,continued high production volumes across consumer credit businesses, depositgrowth in the Regional Banking Group and Middle Markets, and the positiveimpact of hedging activities on mortgage servicing rights at Home Finance.35 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expenses of $1.65&nbsp;billion increased by 2% from the second quarter andby 14% from the third quarter of 2001. The increases reflected the impact ofhigher business volumes. Savings generated by Six Sigma productivity programscontinued to partially offset the growth in expenses. For the first nine monthsof 2002, operating expenses were up 14% from last year due to the impact of theProvidian Master Trust and higher volumes.Managed (including credit cards securitized) credit costs of $823&nbsp;million were12% higher than the second quarter and were 14% higher than the third quarterof 2001. The year-on-year increase reflects a 15% increase in managed consumerloans and, within the managed credit card portfolio, increased charge-offs,primarily related to the Providian Master Trust credit card portfolio. Duringthe quarter, the Firm adopted the proposed Federal Financial InstitutionsExamination Council (&#147;FFIEC&#148;) guidelines by identifying $189&nbsp;million of theconsumer allowance for interest and fee receivables related to managed (retainedand securitized) delinquent card accounts. For further information, see page 51of the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within RMMFS. For further information on the quarterlybusiness-related metrics of these businesses, see page 63.Cardmember ServicesCardmember Services had record operating revenues in the third quarter of 2002,up 36% from the third quarter of 2001 and up 5% from last quarter. The increasein operating revenues from last year reflects higher average loans outstanding,lower funding costs and higher fees (primarily interchange fees, late fees andfee services). The Providian Master Trust credit card portfolio, acquired inFebruary 2002 and successfully converted to the Firm's platform in August 2002,also contributed to the increase in operating revenues from last year.Excluding the Providian Master Trust, revenues from the business were up 13%from last year. The increase in operating revenues from the second quarter of2002 was due to higher average loans outstanding, higher interchange fees andlate fees. End-of-period loans outstanding increased 31% since the thirdquarter of 2001 to over $51&nbsp;billion and were up 3% from last quarter. Totaltransaction volume (purchases, balance transfers and cash advances) was up 28%from last year and 10% from last quarter.For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, operating revenues increased 37%from the same period last year. This was primarily due to the acquisition ofthe Providian Master Trust in February 2002, lower funding costs, higheraverage loans and higher fee revenue. Average loans for the first nine monthsof 2002 were $48.5&nbsp;billion, an increase of 28% from last year. Excluding theProvidian Master Trust, operating revenues increased 16% over the nine-monthperiod ended September&nbsp;30, 2001.Operating expenses increased 35% from the third quarter of 2001 reflectinghigher marketing, higher volume-related expenses and the addition of theProvidian Master Trust portfolio. Operating expenses were up 4% from lastquarter, reflecting higher marketing costs. Operating expenses were up32% for the first nine months of 2002, compared with the first nine months of2001, primarily due to the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust and highermarketing expenditures. Excluding the Providian Master Trust, expensesincreased 15% over the nine month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2001.The managed net charge-off rate for the third quarter was 5.59%, down 15 basispoints and 82 basis points, respectively, from last year's third quarter andthe second quarter of this year. Excluding the Providian Master Trust, themanaged net charge-off rate would have been 5.35%, an improvement of 39 basispoints and 57 basis points, respectively, from the third quarter of 2001 andthe 2002 second quarter. The improvement in the loss rate from last year is dueto higher average loans. The improvement from last quarter is due to lowercontractual losses, lower bankruptcy-related losses and higher average loans.The managed net charge-off rate for the nine-month period was 5.93%, comparedwith 5.47% for the same period of 2001. Excluding the Providian Master Trust,the charge-off rate would have been 5.67%, an increase of 20 basis points. The highercharge-off rate reflects higher contractual losses, partially offset by lowerbankruptcy-related losses and higher average loans. Credit quality remainsrelatively stable. The fourth quarter charge-off rate is expected to increaseslightly due to seasonality.36 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Third quarter 2002 operating earnings were a record $246&nbsp;million, an increaseof 91% from the third quarter of 2001 and 37% from last quarter. TheFirm adopted, effective September&nbsp;30, 2002, the FFIEC proposedguidelines that addressed loss allowance practices for credit cardaccrued interest and fees. For further discussion,see page 51 of the Allowance for Credit Losses section in this Form&nbsp;10-Q. Theincrease in operating earnings from last year was due to higher average loans,higher transaction volume, and the acquisition of the Providian Master Trustportfolio. Excluding the Providian Master Trust portfolio, operating earningsincreased 42%. Operating earnings for the nine-month period were $576&nbsp;million,an increase of 71% from the same period last year. Excluding the ProvidianMaster Trust portfolio, operating earnings increased 26%.Regional Banking GroupRegional Banking Group's third quarter 2002 operating revenue of $689&nbsp;milliondeclined 10% from the 2001 third quarter, but only slightly from the 2002second quarter. The decline in operating revenue reflected the impact of thelower interest rate environment, which resulted in lower net interest earned ondeposit balances. This was partially offset by a 7% growth in retail deposits.On a year-to-date basis, operating revenue declined 9% based on the lowerinterest rate environment.Operating earnings declined 29% and 16% when compared with the 2001 thirdquarter and year-to-date 2001, respectively, principally driven by the lowerinterest rate environment and partially offset by the higher deposit balances.Operating expenses were down 2% from the third quarter of 2001 and year-to-date2001 due to productivity and efficiency initiatives. The year-to-date provisionfor loan losses was down substantially reflecting improved credit quality. Theoverhead ratio in the third quarter of 2002 and on a year-to-date basisincreased from the same periods last year to 75% and 74% as a result of lowerrevenues.Home FinanceHome Finance's third quarter 2002 operating revenue of $974&nbsp;million increased108% from the comparable quarter of last year and 26% from the 2002second quarter. Operating revenue on a year-to-date basis was $2,276&nbsp;million,an 83% increase over the same period last year. During the third quarter, HomeFinance experienced record levels of residential first mortgage loanapplications, due primarily to historically low interest rates, continuing thetrend seen throughout 2002. Revenue growth was driven by the positive impact ofrisk management activities on mortgage servicing rights as well as the benefitof high production volumes and favorable margins over prior periods.For the third quarter of 2002, riskmanagement activities included mortgage servicing rights valuationadjustments of $2,131&nbsp;million that were morethan offset by $2,490&nbsp;million of aggregate derivative gains, realized gainson sales of AFS securities, and net interest earned on AFS securities. Thefavorable risk management results of $359&nbsp;million more than offset theperiodic amortization of mortgage servicing rights of $357&nbsp;million. For thenine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, risk management activities includedmortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments of $3,454&nbsp;million thatwere more than offset by derivatives gains, realized gains on sales of AFSsecurities, and net interest earned on AFS securities totaling $4,013million. The favorable risk management results of $559&nbsp;million partiallyoffset the periodic amortization of mortgage servicing rights of $1,024million. The net impact of the risk management activities and periodicamortization of $2&nbsp;million and negative $465&nbsp;million for the 2002 thirdquarter and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, respectively, compared withnegative $283&nbsp;million and negative $951&nbsp;million for the 2001 third quarterand nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2001. The risk management results weredriven by high mortgage-swap spreads and a favorable interest rateenvironment. Management anticipates an eventual decrease in this revenuecomponent as spreads and interest rates revert to normal levels. The increasein amortization of the mortgage servicing rights resulted from continueddeclines in interest rates during 2002.Revenues were also positively affected by the continued expansion of HomeFinance into strategic business sectors such as home equity, where volumesincreased 43% and 56% compared with the third quarter and first nine months of2001, respectively. Loan originations for the third quarter and year-to-date2002 were $35&nbsp;billion and $95&nbsp;billion, respectively, and included originationsfrom the retail, wholesale and correspondent (traditional and negotiated)channels. Third quarter 2002 origination volume represented a 34% increase fromthe prior quarter as investments made in the direct-to-consumer channelsproduced increased application and closed-loan volumes.37 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating earnings of $393&nbsp;million rose 222% versus the third quarter of 2001and 47% compared with the second quarter of 2002. The earnings this quarterwere the third consecutive record level for Home Finance, bringing year-to-dateearnings to $795&nbsp;million, or a 154% increase over the same period last year.Significant revenue growth, coupled with strong expense management, allowedHome Finance to achieve record earnings and an operating efficiency ratio of31% and 39% for the third quarter and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002,respectively.The carrying value of mortgage servicing rightsdeclined 45% from $6.6&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001 to$3.6&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2002. This decline included theimpact of higher prepayments resulting from lower interest rates net ofnew originations. The Firm offsets the interest rate risk exposure in the MSRsby designating certain interest rate derivatives (e.g., a combination of swaps,swaptions, and floor contracts that produces an interest rate profile oppositeto the MSRs) as fair value hedges of specified MSRs under SFAS 133. SFAS 133hedge accounting allows the carrying value of the hedged MSRs to be adjustedthrough earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedgingderivatives is recognized through earnings. Both of these valuation adjustmentsare recorded in the mortgage servicing fees component within Fees andCommissions. See page 25 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q for more details. For a furtherdiscussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 16 onpage 18.AFS securities and certain &#147;nonhedge&#148; derivatives are also used to manage therisk exposure of the MSRs. These instruments are accounted for as stand-aloneinstruments because AFS securities do not qualify as hedges under SFAS 133 andthe derivatives have not been designated by management as hedging derivatives.Accordingly, the securities are accounted for as AFS securities under SFAS 115and the &#147;nonhedge&#148; derivatives are accounted for as trading derivatives. Gainsand losses on these instruments are recognized in earnings in Securities Gains(Losses) (i.e., realized gains/losses on securities sold) and Trading Revenue,respectively. Unrealized gains/losses on AFS securities are reported in OtherComprehensive Income. The mortgage-servicing portfolio was $435&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2002, anincrease of 2% from the same quarter ended last year. The servicing portfoliowas flat relative to the second quarter 2002.Middle MarketsMiddle Markets operating revenues in the 2002 third quarter increased 5% and 3%in comparison with the third quarter of last year and second quarter of 2002,respectively. The increase from last year was the result of higher depositlevels and capital market fees despite difficult market conditions. Despite thenegative impact of lower interest rates on deposit spreads, revenue increased$30&nbsp;million, or 3%, for the nine months ended 2002 over the same period a yearago. Deposit growth, strong fees in lieu of compensating balances andcapital market fees contributed to the increase. Year-to-date expenses werereduced $9&nbsp;million or 2% for the nine month period ended 2002 as staffreductions in the fourth quarter of 2001 and strong expense disciplinecontributed to the improvement.Operating earnings rose 26% over the third quarter of 2001, but remainedrelatively flat from the second quarter of this year. The increase in thequarter compared to last year was attributable to lower credit costs due toimprovement in the quality of the loan portfolio as well as growth in theoperating margin. For the nine months ended 2002, Middle Market earnings wereup $65&nbsp;million or 34% from the same period a year ago. A reduction in creditcosts was the most significant factor in the year-over-year improvement. Inaddition, lower charge-offs and improving portfolio quality contributed $76million or a 69% improvement. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, theefficiency ratio was 51%, compared with 54% in the same period last year.Auto FinanceAuto Finance's third quarter 2002 operating revenue of $167&nbsp;million was up 19%from the 2001 third quarter and flat relative to the second quarter of 2002.The increase in revenue was driven by strong operating performance due tohigher average loans outstanding, lower funding costs and improved originationvolumes. Auto Finance experienced record levels of retail and lease originationvolume of $7.6&nbsp;billion in the third quarter, a 46% increase from the thirdquarter of last year, and a 46% increase from the second quarter of 2002. Forthe first nine months, operating revenue of $506&nbsp;million was up 30% from lastyear. Higher average loans and leases outstanding, up 22% from last year, andcontinued growth in origination volume drove the increase in revenue. Firstnine months origination volume of $18.6&nbsp;billion was up 30% from last year.Operating earnings of $27&nbsp;million declined 18% from the third quarter 2001 and67% from second quarter 2002. The decline reflects the impact of higher creditcosts related to an increase in the allowance for loan losses due to growth inthe portfolio. The overhead ratio in the third quarter of 2002 decreased from 37% to35% compared with the third quarter of 2001 and remained unchanged from the secondquarter of 2002.For the first nine months, operatingearnings of $142&nbsp;million were 54% higherthan 2001, reflecting higher revenue due to increases in average loanoutstandings and lower funding costs, partially offset by higher operatingexpenses and higher credit costs due to volume growth. During the period, theoverhead ratio improved from 38% to 34%.38 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile of Investment Management & PrivateBanking (&#147;IMPB&#148;), see pages 34-35 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report. Thefollowing table reflects selected financial data for IMPB:Investment Management & Private Banking had operating revenues of $691&nbsp;millionin the third quarter of 2002, 5% below the second quarter and 9% lower than thethird quarter of 2001. Declines in global equity valuations and lower investoractivity levels accounted for most of the decreases. Additionally, reductionsin the Private Bank's loan portfolio reduced net interest earnings from theyear ago quarter. Operating expenses of $551&nbsp;million for the quarter were 3%below the second quarter and down 7% from the third quarter of 2001. During thethird quarter of 2002, Brown & Co., the specialty online brokerage unit ofJPMorgan Chase, was transferred from the Firm's retail business to this unit aspart of IMPB's strategy to grow its retail asset management business. (Priorperiods were adjusted to reflect the reorganization). Credit costs of $25million were higher than the $23&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 and $3million in the third quarter of 2001 reflecting the generally weaker creditenvironment.Operating earnings of $98&nbsp;million were down 12% from the second quarter and21% from the third quarter of 2001. Pre-tax margin in the third quarter was17%, compared with 19% last quarter and 22% in the third quarter of 2001.The table below reflects the assets under management in IMPB as of September30, 2002:Total assets under management at quarter-end of $492&nbsp;billion were 9% lowerthan the second quarter of 2002 and down 15% from the third quarter of 2001.Market depreciation and institutional outflows accounted for the year-on-yeardeclines. These effects outweighed the positive flows and increased assetsunder management for retail mutual funds. The Firm also has a 45% interest inAmerican Century Companies, Inc. whose assets under management were $70billion at quarter end, $81&nbsp;billion as of the second quarter of 2002 and $82billion as of the third quarter of 2001.39 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMorgan Partners, see pages 36-37of the JPMorgan Chase 2001 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected financial data of JPMorgan Partners:JPMorgan Partners had an operating loss of $284&nbsp;million for the 2002 thirdquarter, compared with an operating loss of $169&nbsp;million in the second quarterand an operating loss of $153&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001.Total net private equity gains were a loss of $299&nbsp;million, as compared withlosses of $125&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002 and $102&nbsp;million in thethird quarter of 2001. The current quarter results were driven by write-downsand write-offs on private holdings of $290&nbsp;million and net mark-to-marketlosses on public securities of $120&nbsp;million, partially offset by net realizedgains of $111&nbsp;million. Losses on both the privately-held andpublicly-held portions of the portfolio were concentrated intelecommunications and technology investments. Currently, there arelimited exit and financing opportunities in the private equity markets,thereby constraining realization opportunities. The current market environmentis likely to continue to contribute to write-downs in the portfolio, consistent with thelevels seen during the first three quarters of 2002. Given the volatile natureof the markets, JPMP's reported results for any period will include publicsecurities unrealized gains or losses. The Firm continues to believe that JPMPwill create value over time.JPMorgan Partners Investment PortfolioThe following table presents the carrying values and costs of the JPMPinvestment portfolio for the dates indicated.40 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table presents information about the 10 largest holdings ofpublic securities in the JPMP investment portfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2002:Technology, media and telecommunications (&#147;TMT&#148;) investments at September&nbsp;30,2002 were $1.4&nbsp;billion, or 18% of the total portfolio, compared with $3.0billion, or 32% of the portfolio, at September&nbsp;30, 2001, primarily as a resultof write-downs in the portfolio. Telecommunication investments were$386&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2002, of which$323&nbsp;million were in the privately-held portion of the portfolio.JPMP's investment for the Firm's account was $0.3&nbsp;billion during the thirdquarter of 2002 and $0.6&nbsp;billion for the year-to-date, with deal flow primarilyin the industrial growth and life sciences/healthcare industry sectors.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's support units include Enterprise Technology Services,Corporate Business Services, legal, audit and finance. For a furtherdiscussion of the business profiles of these Support Units as well as adescription of Corporate, see page 41 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.Corporate reflects the accounting effects remaining at the corporate levelafter the application of management accounting policies of the Firm. Thesepolicies include the allocation of costs associated with technology,operational and staff support services with the respective revenue generatingbusinesses and allow management to evaluate business performance on anallocated basis.41 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)This sector usually operates at a loss. Negative revenue is the result of theover-allocation of capital to the other business sectors and theover-allocation of revenues that arise from the application of funds transferpricing and other management accounting policies. Expense items usually resultfrom timing differences in allocations to other business sectors and residualsfrom interoffice allocation among the business segments. Tax expense reflectsthe difference between the aggregate recorded at the consolidated level andthe amount recorded at the segments. The third quarter of 2002 included a $67million reversal of previously accrued expenses associated with restrictedstock issued under employee benefit plans that contained stock price targets,which are unlikely to be attained within the required time framesspecified under the terms of the awards. These reversals totaled $120&nbsp;million on ayear-to-date basis.Although the Corporate segment has no traditional credit assets, the residualcomponent of the allowance for credit losses is maintained at the corporatelevel, and is not allocated to any specific line of business. Similarly, for2001, credit costs reflected the difference between the aggregate provisionrecorded at the consolidated level and the provision allocated to the businesssegments. For a further discussion of the residual component, see pages 29 and50.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Firm's accounting policies are integral to understanding the resultsreported. The Firm's most complex accounting policies require management'sjudgment to ascertain the valuation of certain assets and liabilities. The Firmhas established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended toensure that valuation methods are well-controlled and applied consistently fromperiod to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended toensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriatemanner. The Firm's most critical accounting policies involving the moresignificant management valuation judgments involve the accounting for theallowance for loan losses and for the fair value of financial instruments. Fora further description of the types of judgments and estimates required in theseaccounting policies, see page 41 and the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements in the 2001 Annual Report.42 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RISK MANAGEMENTJPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholdervalue. The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market,operational and business, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussionof these risks and definitions of terms associated with managing these risks,see pages 45-62 and the Glossary of Terms in the 2001 Annual Report.CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk profile as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002 focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001and should be read in conjunction with pages 47-54 and 75-77 of JPMorganChase's 2001 Annual Report.The Firm assesses its credit exposures on a managed basis, taking into accountthe impact of credit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of creditcosts on a managed, or operating, basis to reported results, see page 30 ofthis Form&nbsp;10-Q. The following table presents the Firm's managed credit-relatedinformation for the dates indicated.43 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's total managed credit-related assets were $329&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, reflecting a 6% increase compared with December&nbsp;31, 2001and an increase of less than 1% compared with September&nbsp;30, 2001.Consumer managed loans increased $9.8&nbsp;billion since December&nbsp;31,2001, reflecting growth in the auto loan and credit card portfolios, offset inpart by a decline in the residential mortgage loan portfolio as a result ofhigher prepayments due to lower interest rates.Commercial loans declined by$7.4&nbsp;billion or 7% from year-end 2001 and by $19.1&nbsp;billion or 16% fromSeptember&nbsp;30, 2001. The decline in commercial loans since September&nbsp;30, 2001continues to be the result of current economic conditions, as well as theFirm's ongoing discipline of originating loans for distribution and itsstrategy to reduce its commercial credit exposure. Commercial credit-related assets (consisting of loans and derivatives) were$185&nbsp;billion, of which $132&nbsp;billion, or approximately 71%, were consideredinvestment grade at September&nbsp;30, 2002, compared with $176&nbsp;billion, orapproximately 65%, at year-end 2001. The increase is largely due to theincrease in derivative and FX contracts receivable. At September&nbsp;30, 2002, 80%of the Firm's total commercial credit exposure of $425&nbsp;billion (which includescredit-related assets and unfunded commercial commitments) was consideredinvestment grade, compared with 77% considered investment grade at year-end2001.In 2002, particularly in the third quarter, the Firm experienced a significantdeterioration in the credit quality of its commercial loans in thetelecommunications (including other companies with an interdependence upon thetelecommunications sector), cable and the merchant energy sectors. The telecomindustry worldwide and the cable industry, particularly in Europe, have beenadversely affected by insufficient resources to fund capital expenditures andby severe liquidity constraints. The Firm has thus seen a concurrentdeterioration in the risk profile of its credit portfolio in these sectors.This deterioration was accelerated in the third quarter in part by specific actions taken byseveral counterparties during the quarter which caused the Firm to reassessthese portfolios. This resulted in exposures migrating to ratings deemed bythe Firm to be criticized and a higher level of nonperforming loans andcharge-offs. The Firm has also experienced an acceleration in criticized loansin the merchant energy sector during the third quarter and may experience anincrease in nonperforming loans in this sector during the balance of the year.As of September&nbsp;30, 2002, credit-related assets in the telecom sector were$8.8&nbsp;billion (or 5% of total commercial credit-related assets); in the cablesector, $3.7&nbsp;billion (or 2% of the total); and in the merchant energy sector,$2.2&nbsp;billion (or approximately 1% of the total). Outlined on page 64 is aquarterly credit profile of the Firm's exposure to the telecom and related,cable and merchant energy and related sectors.Excluding these three industry sectors, the credit quality of the commercialloan portfolio has remained stable.Total nonperforming assets were $5.5&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2002, comparedwith $3.9&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001 and $2.6&nbsp;billion as of September&nbsp;30,2001. Included in nonperforming assets at September&nbsp;30, 2002 and December&nbsp;31,2001 were $1.1&nbsp;billion in Enron-related surety receivables and letter ofcredit. The increase in nonperforming assets from year-end was primarily due tothe continued weakness in the telecom and cable sectors of the commercial loanportfolio.Total net charge-offs in the Firm's commercial portfolio were $834&nbsp;million inthe third quarter of 2002; managed consumer net charge-offs for the quarterwere $786&nbsp;million. The aggregate increase of $465&nbsp;million over the secondquarter was primarily due to charge-offs in the telecommunications and cablesectors of the commercial portfolio. Telecom and cable represented 68% of totalnet commercial charge-offs in the third quarter of 2002. Year-to-date, telecomand cable represented 54% of total net commercial charge-offs.44 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIONM &#150; Not meaningful.45 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table presents the Firm's commercial credit exposure for thedates indicated:Commercial LoansThe following discussion relates to the specific loan categories within thecommercial portfolio:Commercial and Industrial: The domestic commercial and industrial portfoliodecreased $5.1&nbsp;billion from 2001&nbsp;year-end. Net charge-offs in the 2002 thirdquarter were $310&nbsp;million, compared with $132&nbsp;million in the third quarter of2001. Nonperforming domestic commercial and industrial loans were $1,596million, an increase of $410&nbsp;million from the 2001&nbsp;year-end. The increaserelates primarily to nonperforming telecommunications-related and cable loans.The foreign commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $31.4&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, down 6%, compared with year-end 2001. Nonperformingforeign commercial and industrial loans were $1,696&nbsp;million, an increase of$1,017&nbsp;million from year-end 2001, primarily due to increases in nonperformingcable and telecommunications loans. Net charge-offs in the foreign commercialand industrial loan portfolio for the third quarter of 2002 increased to $529million from $63&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2001.Financial Institutions: Loans to financial institutions increased $96&nbsp;millionwhen compared with year-end. Nonperforming financial institution loansincreased from $56&nbsp;million at year-end to $212&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2002due primarily to one large domestic counterparty.Enron-Related Exposure: The Firm's exposure to Enron and Enron-relatedentities as of September&nbsp;30, 2002 was $1,585&nbsp;million. The exposure is composedof the following:For additional discussion of the accounting policies related to the abovecategories, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the2001 Annual Report.The Firm charged-off and wrote-down $456&nbsp;million of Enron-related exposure inthe fourth quarter of 2001. During the first nine months of 2002, the Firm'sexposure to Enron was reduced by an additional $76&nbsp;million as a result ofcharge-offs and valuation adjustments. The Firm will continue to adjust thevaluation of its exposures to Enron nonperforming loans and trading assets infuture periods, as appropriate. For a discussion of the Firm's risksassociated with the surety receivables and letter of credit, included withinother assets, see Legal Proceedings on pages 66-67 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q.46 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Derivative and Foreign Exchange ContractsFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized byJPMorgan Chase in connection with its trading and end-user activities, see Note16 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q, and pages 51 and 52 and Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001Annual Report. The following table provides the remaining maturities ofderivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September&nbsp;30, 2002 andDecember&nbsp;31, 2001.The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of September&nbsp;30, 2002, ofthe Firm's balance sheet exposure to derivative and foreign exchange contracts,net of cash and other highly liquid collateral held by the Firm. The Firm'sinternal risk ratings generally represent a risk profile similar to that of theindependent rating agencies; ratings below are based upon the Firm's internalobligor risk ratings and are presented on a Standard & Poor's-equivalent basis:The majority of the Firm's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes.Certain of the Firm's trading-related derivatives, particularly prepaidderivatives transactions, may have the effect of providing financing tocustomers. In addition, certain of the Firm's trading-related derivativesinclude provisions that require the Firm, upon specified downgrades in itscredit ratings, to post collateral for the benefit of the counterparty. Certainderivatives contracts also provide for the termination of the derivativecontract, generally upon JPMorgan Chase Bank being rated BBB.Country ExposureThe following discussion is based on management's view of country exposure.For a further discussion of the Firm's country exposure, see page 52 of the2001 Annual Report.During the third quarter of 2002, the Firm's selected country exposure levelsremained relatively stable or declined compared with the previous quarter.Exposure to Brazil declined to $1.9&nbsp;billion as of September&nbsp;30, 2002, comparedwith $2.1&nbsp;billion as of June&nbsp;30, 2002 and $3.3&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31,2001. The decline from 2001 year-end was due to loan maturities, declines in counterpartyexposures on derivatives, and a lower level of local issuerexposures. The reduction in counterparty exposure includes the effect of fairvalue adjustments on derivatives. Mark-to-market exposures on derivatives inBrazil are sensitive to moves in local interest rates and foreign exchangerates.In Argentina, exposure (before specific allowance for loan losses) totaled$342&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2002, compared with $589&nbsp;million at December31, 2001. The decrease includes a $100&nbsp;million decline in trading assets andother reductions from a combination of mark-to-markets, write-downs on equityinvestments, and loan and derivative payments received. The Firm currentlybelieves future losses related to Argentine loans and trading assets will notbe material. In Japan, exposures declined due to fluctuations in tradingpositions and mark-to-market exposure on derivatives that are sensitive toforeign exchange rates. Exposure to Mexico increased principally as a resultof fluctuations in trading positions.47 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries.CONSUMER PORTFOLIO48 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio is primarily domestic and is geographicallywell-diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled $144billion at September&nbsp;30, 2002, an increase of approximately $10&nbsp;billion since2001&nbsp;year-end. Consumer net charge-offs on a managed basis were $786&nbsp;millionand $626&nbsp;million for the third quarters of 2002 and 2001, respectively. Theincrease was primarily due to an increase in credit card net charge-offs due,in part, to a higher level of outstandings and the impact of the ProvidianMaster Trust acquisition.The following discussion relates to the specific loan categories within theconsumer portfolio:Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $55.7&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, a $3.8&nbsp;billion decrease from the 2001&nbsp;year-end.Nonperforming 1-4 family residential mortgage loans increased $34&nbsp;million fromyear-end. The net charge-off rate of 0.05% for the third quarter of 2002decreased from 0.10% in the third quarter of 2001. At September&nbsp;30, 2002, theFirm had $1.3&nbsp;billion of sub-prime residential mortgage loans, of which $0.7billion were held for sale.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet aswell as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed credit card receivables were approximately $50.4&nbsp;billion at September30, 2002, an increase of 23%, when compared with year-end 2001. The increasereflects the acquisition of credit card assets from Providian Financial Corporation in February2002. During the 2002 third quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage ofaverage credit card receivables decreased to 5.51%, compared with5.64% for the third quarter of 2001. Loans over 90&nbsp;days past due decreased to 1.93% of theportfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2002, compared with 2.22% at December&nbsp;31, 2001.Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased by $4.9&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, when compared with year-end 2001. The charge-off rate of0.64% for the 2002 third quarter continues to be indicative of this portfolio'sselective approach to asset origination. Total originations were $7.6&nbsp;billionfor the third quarter of 2002, compared with $5.2&nbsp;billion for the comparableperiod in 2001.Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans of $7.2&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2002 declined 11%, compared with year-end levels. The net charge-off raterelated to this portfolio increased in the 2002 third quarter to 2.53%, as aresult of slightly higher charge-offs in a discontinued installment loanportfolio.Allowance for Credit LossesComponents of Allowance for Credit Losses49 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Summary of Changes in the AllowanceCredit CostsFor the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002Loans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to coverprobable credit losses as of September&nbsp;30, 2002 for which either the asset isnot specifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fullydetermined. The allowance has both specific and expected loss components and aresidual component to reflect the credit quality in the Firm's loan portfolio.As of September&nbsp;30, 2002, management deemed the allowance to be adequate(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable). The allowance represented 2.49% of loans at September&nbsp;30, 2002,compared with 2.08% at year-end 2001. The allowance for loan losses wasincreased by $739&nbsp;million from year-end 2001, as outlined in more detailbelow, and by $1,389&nbsp;million from September&nbsp;30, 2001.The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $1,525&nbsp;million atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, an increase of $469&nbsp;million, or 44%, from year-end 2001.The specific loss component covers those commercial loans deemed by the Firmto be criticized. The Firm internally categorizes its criticized commercialloans into three groups: doubtful, substandard, and special mention. Alldoubtful loans and some substandard loans are categorized as nonperforming.The increase from December&nbsp;31, 2001 in the specific loss component isprimarily due to the deterioration in commercial loans related to the telecomand cable sectors, which has led to an increase in criticized loans and to anincrease in nonperforming loans.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $554&nbsp;million atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, a decrease of $114&nbsp;million, or 17%, from year-end 2001.The expected loss component covers noncriticized commercial loans, and is aproduct of default probability and loss severity. Default probability is aweighted product of actual average defaults through the credit cycle and acurrent market estimate of defaults, and loss severity is based on the Firm'shistorical experience. These factors are continuously refined. The changesmade in these factors during the year to date had no significant impact on thedetermination of the expected loss component during the first nine months ofthe year. The $114&nbsp;million decrease in the expected loss component was due toa reduction in amount, and the improvement in average quality, of thenoncriticized portion of the loan portfolio.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2,365&nbsp;million atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002, an increase of $260&nbsp;million, or 12%, from year-end 2001.The increase was primarily due to the Providian Master Trust credit card portfolio inCardmember Services. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in theamount of retained credit card loans (excluding the Providian Master Trustportfolio) and a reduction in expected loss rates in the Auto Financeportfolio due to improved delinquency rates.The residual component of the allowance was $819&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30,2002, an increase of $124&nbsp;million, or 18%, from year-end 2001. The residualcomponent is intended to cover uncertainties that could affect management'sestimate of probable losses. It has been the Firm's policy to keep theresidual component in a range between 10% and 20% of the total allowance forloan losses. At September&nbsp;30, 2002, the residual component representedapproximately 16% of the total allowance for loan losses.50 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)In July 2002, the FFIEC proposedguidelines that, among other items, address loss allowance practicesfor credit card accrued interest and fees. The proposed guidelineswould require either the establishment of a reserve for uncollectedaccrued interest and fees or placement of certain delinquent loans onnonaccrual status. The Firm determined that the total allowance forloan losses for credit card accrued interest and fees, after givingeffect to the adoption of the FFIEC proposed guidelines, was$189&nbsp;million and that, as of September&nbsp;30, 2002, theFirm's total allowance for credit losses was sufficient to coverthe additional reserves required as a result of its adoption of theFFIEC provisional guidance.Lending-Related Commitments: JPMorgan Chase also has an allowance for itsoff-balance sheet lending-related commitments, using a methodology similar tothat for the loan portfolio. This allowance, which is reported in OtherLiabilities, was $573&nbsp;million, $282&nbsp;million and $283&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30,2002, December&nbsp;31, 2001 and September&nbsp;30, 2001, respectively. The increase inthe allowance is primarily due to one customer in the telecom sector anddeterioration in the criticized portion of the portfolio.MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTAggregate VAR ExposureJPMorgan Chase's statisticalmarket risk measure, value-at-risk (&#147;VAR&#148;), gaugesthe dollar amount of potential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinarymarket environment. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VARcalculation that includes its trading, investment, and Asset/Liability (&#147;A/L&#148;)activities. The Firm calculated the VAR numbers reported below using a one-daytime horizon and a 99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect toincur losses greater than predicted by VAR estimates only once in every 100trading days, or about 2.5 times a year. VARs for the investment portfolio andA/L activities are measures of the amount of potential change in economic valueof these portfolios; however, they are not measures of reported revenues sincethose activities are not marked-to-market through earnings.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thefollowing table provides a meaningful overview of the Firm's market riskexposure arising from trading activities and the investment andAsset/Liability portfolios.Aggregate Portfolio51 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The daily average Trading Portfolio VAR for the first nine months of 2002 was$73.2&nbsp;million. The largest contributor was interest rate risk, which includedcredit spread risk; both accounted for roughly two-thirds of the September&nbsp;30,2002 VAR. The diversification effect was higher overall during the thirdquarter of 2002 than it was at June&nbsp;30, 2002, but declined during the quarter,averaging $(36.5) million during July, and then declining to an average of$(29.1) million during September. The degree of diversification depends oncorrelations of prices across different markets, and on the alignment of theFirm's mark-to-market positions across these markets. During the 2002 thirdquarter, market events were accompanied by higher correlations among interestrates, bond spreads and equity prices resulting in the declining degree ofdiversification over the quarter.Histogram:The following histogram illustrates the Firm's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income, brokeragecommissions, underwriting fees or other revenue. In the first nine months of2002, JPMorgan Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 164out of 189&nbsp;days, with 103&nbsp;days exceeding positive $25&nbsp;million. Losses weresustained on 25 of the 189&nbsp;days represented in the histogram; 17 of those daysoccurred in the third quarter. Poor overall trading results in the thirdquarter accounted for the losses during those 17&nbsp;days. The worst daily lossduring the 2002 third quarter was $(59.9) million.To evaluate the soundness of the Firm's VAR model, JPMorgan Chase conductsdaily back-testing of VAR against actual financial results. For the first ninemonths of 2002, there was no day on which actual Firm-wide marketrisk-related losses exceededcorporate VAR.The inset above examines the 25&nbsp;days in which the Firm posted marketrisk-related losses and depicts the amount by which the VAR was greater thanthe actual loss on each day. The inset shows that no losses exceeded VAR on anyof these days, a performance statistically consistent with the Firm's 99%confidence level.The average market risk-related revenue during third quarter of 2002 was $17.1million, which was significantly below the average daily market risk-relatedrevenue during the first six months of 2002. The lower average marketrisk-related revenues for third quarter 2002 were due to lower revenues on dayson which the Firm experienced gains as well as to a larger number of days inwhich the Firm experienced losses. As noted above, none of the losses on any ofthe 17&nbsp;days in the third quarter exceeded the VAR for the given day. Thisindicates that the decline in total market risk-related revenue in the thirdquarter 2002 does not represent an amount of daily trading volatility in excessof that predicted by the Firm's risk measurements. In addition, the average VARdid not change significantly between the first six months of 2002 and the thirdquarter 2002. This indicates that the decline in total market risk-relatedrevenues also does not reflect an increased level of daily trading risk. Thus,while daily losses were within the expected losses as calculated by VAR, andwhile daily trading risk did not change materially between the first six monthsand the third quarter, the Firm did experience a larger number of daily losses.These losses reflected the outcome of specific positioning decisions.52 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Stress TestingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets.The following table represents the potential economic value stress test loss(pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfolio predicted by JPMorgan Chase'sstress test scenarios.Largest Monthly Stress Test Loss&#150; Pre-TaxLargest Monthly Stress Test Loss&#150; Pre-TaxStress tests are generally performed mid-month; the stress results at September12, 2002 were mostly driven by exposures sensitive to a stress scenario whereequity prices decline significantly and, at the same time, credit pricesdecline and interest rates fall in the major currencies. The largest componentsof the stress results were long credit positions in convertible bonds in NorthAmerica, as well as equity derivative positions in Europe. The equityderivative positions in Europe were in the more highly structured books.It is important to note that VAR results cannot be directly correlated tostress test loss results for the following two reasons: (a)&nbsp;stress test lossesare calculated at mid-month, while VAR is performed daily and reported for theperiod-end date; and (b)&nbsp;VAR and stress tests are two distinct riskmeasurements yielding very different loss potentials. Thus, although the sametrading portfolios are used for both tests, VAR is based on a distribution ofone-day historical losses measured over the most recent one year; in contrast,stress testing is designed to subject the portfolio to more extreme, largermarket moves over a longer time horizon (e.g., 2-3&nbsp;weeks), thus testing theFirm's trading exposures to unlikely but plausible events in abnormal markets.In addition, as VAR and stress are distinct risk measurements, the impact ofportfolio diversification can vary greatly. For VAR, markets can change inpatterns over a one-year time horizon, moving from highly correlated to lessso; in stress testing, the focus is on a single event and the associatedcorrelations in an extreme market situation. As a result, while VAR over agiven time horizon can be lowered by a diversification benefit in theportfolio, this diversification benefit would not necessarily manifest itselfin stress test scenarios, which assume large coherent moves across allmarkets. For a further discussion of the Firm's stress testing methodology,see page 56 of the 2001 Annual Report.53 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2001 and should be read inconjunction with page 46 and Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.CapitalJPMorgan Chase's capital ratios at September&nbsp;30, 2002 were well in excess ofregulatory guidelines. At September&nbsp;30, 2002, the Tier 1 and Total Capitalratios were 8.7% and 12.4%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was5.4%. At September&nbsp;30, 2002, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (thesum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was $55.0&nbsp;billion, an increase of $1.0billion from December&nbsp;31, 2001. This increase principally reflected a $0.7billion increase in Tier 1 Capital, reflecting the issuance of $1.0&nbsp;billion intrust preferred securities and the net stock issuance of $0.5&nbsp;billion relatedto employee benefit plans, partially offset by the redemption of $0.6&nbsp;billionin preferred stock of a subsidiary. The Firm did not repurchase shares of itscommon stock during the first nine months of 2002.DividendsIn the third quarter of 2002, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cashdividend on its common stock of $0.34 per share payable October&nbsp;31, 2002 tostockholders of record at the close of business October&nbsp;4, 2002. The Board ofDirectors expressed its intent, on September&nbsp;17, 2002, to continue thecurrent dividend level, provided that capital ratios remain strong andearnings prospects exceed the current dividend.The following table shows JPMorgan Chase's capital generation and use duringthe periods indicated.Economic risk capital: JPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy by measuringrisk utilizing internal risk assessment methodologies. The Firm quantifiescredit, market and operating risk for each business and, for JPMP, privateequity risk, and assigns capital to each business accordingly. Thesemethodologies are discussed in the risk management sections of the 2001 AnnualReport on pages 45-62. The following table presents the assessment atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002 of capital adequacy for each risk factor as estimated bythe Firm's economic capital allocation model. Credit risk capital increasedsince September&nbsp;30, 2001 due to higher retail credit exposure (principally asa result of the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust portfolio) andhigher capital factors on, and downward migration of, the commercial loanportfolio. Private equity capital declined over the period due to the lowercarrying value of the portfolio. Internal capital allocations may change fromtime to time to reflect refinements of economic capital methodologies.54 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational risk management, refer topages 58-59 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk management shouldbe read in conjunction with pages 60-61 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 AnnualReport.LiquidityDuring the first nine months of 2002, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately $9.6billion of long-term debt and $1.0&nbsp;billion of trust preferred capitalsecurities. During the same period, $11.2&nbsp;billion of long-term debt matured orwas redeemed, and $550&nbsp;million of preferred stock of subsidiary was redeemed.The Firm's total assets increased to $741.8&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2002 from$693.6&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2001. The balance sheet growth, driven byincreased trading and hedging activity, was primarily composed of growth intrading and investment security assets, financed by increases in repurchaseagreements and trading liabilities.JPMorgan Chase's liquidity risk management framework incorporates monitoringtools (see the 2001 Annual Report for additional detail) and a contingencyfunding plan. The plan forecasts potential funding needs, taking into accountboth on- and off-balance sheet exposures, evaluating separately access tofunds by the parent company and JPMorgan Chase Bank. The parent company'sliquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet fundingrequirements for normal operating activities and to repay all obligations with a maturity of one year and under. In addition, JPMorgan ChaseBank maintains appropriate liquidity to manage through normal and stressperiods, taking into account historical data on funding of loan commitments(e.g., commercial paper back-up facilities), liquidity commitments to conduitsand collateral-posting requirements. Sources of funds include the capitalmarkets, the operations of the Firm's subsidiaries (including the ability ofJPMorgan Chase Bank to raise funds through deposits), securitization and loansyndication programs. The recent credit ratings downgrades have not had amaterial adverse effect on the Firm's liquidity, as further described below.During the third quarter of 2002, theFirm securitized approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans and $2.1&nbsp;billion of credit card loans,resulting in pre-tax gains on securitizations of $117&nbsp;million and $13&nbsp;million,respectively. For a further discussion on loan securitizations, see Note 8 onpage 13. The ability to securitize loans, and the associated gains on thosesecuritizations, are principally dependent on the credit quality and yields onthe assets securitized and are generally not dependent on the ratings of theissuing entity; e.g. JPMorgan Chase Bank or Chase USA, N.A.Derivatives are used in interest rate risk management to swap fixed-rate debtto floating-rate obligations and to swap floating-rate debt to fixed-rateobligations to achieve the Firm's desired interest rate risk profile. The Firmalso enters into derivatives contracts to hedge the variability in interestrates that arises from other floating-rate financial instruments andforecasted transactions such as the rollover of short-term assets andliabilities.Credit ratingsThe cost and availability of unsecured financing are influenced by creditratings. During the third quarter of 2002, both S&P and Fitch lowered the debtratings of JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and its subsidiaries onenotch. On October 9th, Moody's lowered the debt ratings of JPMorgan Chase'sparent holding company and its subsidiaries one notch as well. See Note 1 andpage 47 of this Form&nbsp;10-Q for further information about the implications of aratings downgrade for the Firm.The marginal cost of funds has increased, and certain counterparties andinvestors have reduced limits and maturities of exposure to the Firm as aresult of these ratings actions. It is difficult to estimate the financialimpact of the ratings downgrade. As noted above, the Firm has, for severalquarters, been managing its liquidity in light of the weak capital marketsenvironment and its earnings prospects over the short- and medium-term. Consistent with its policy, the Firmhas raised funds at the holding company sufficient to cover maturingobligations over the next 12&nbsp;months. Long-term funding needs for the parentholding company over the next several quarters are expected to be modest.55 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorgan Chase Bank's creditratings as of October&nbsp;31, 2002 were as follows:As of October&nbsp;31, 2002, the ratings outlook for the parent holding company byMoody's was stable, and the ratings outlook for the parent holding company byStandard & Poor's and Fitch were negative.The amount of liquidity commitmentsissued to SPEs are included in JPMorgan Chase's outstandingcommitments to lend; therefore, the Firm's liquidity managementframework takes these commitments into account. The Firm could berequired to provide funding under certain of these liquiditycommitments if the commercial paper rating of JPMorgan Chase Bankwere to fall below A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, F-1. For a furtherdiscussion of the effects of such a ratings downgrade on theFirm's commercial paper conduits and client intermediationvehicles, see Note&nbsp;1 on page&nbsp;7 of this Form 10-Q.PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity risk management, refer topage 62 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervisionand Regulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2001 Form10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's banksubsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends up to the limitations imposed upon such banks byregulatory restrictions. Under the currently more restrictive of thetwo dividend tests, a dividend may not be declared by a bank in anycalendar year in excess of the current year's net income plusthe retained net income of the previous two years. Under thisdividend limitation, the dividend capacity of the Firm's banks totaled approximately $2.9&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2002. Dividend capacity commencing January&nbsp;1, 2003 will exclude the banks' aggregate retained earnings fromfiscal year 2000, which totaled $1.2&nbsp;billion, but will includenext year's banks' earnings.ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSIn July 2002, the FASB released an exposure draft on Consolidation of CertainSpecial-Purpose Entities, an interpretation of ARB No.&nbsp;51. The proposedinterpretation provides guidance for determining when an entity is not an SPEand therefore would not be subject to this proposed interpretation. Theproposed interpretation also introduces a new framework to identify when acontrolling financial interest has been established by means other than votinginterests and requires consolidation of an SPE by an enterprise that holdssuch a controlling financial interest (the primary beneficiary). The proposedinterpretation is not intended to require consolidation if the SPE effectivelydisperses the risks and benefits among the various parties involved. The FASBis currently in the process of redeliberating the exposure draft and itsimpact is yet to be determined.In August 2002, JPMorgan Chase announced its decision to adopt Statement ofFinancial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-BasedCompensation&#148; (&#147;SFAS 123&#148;), beginning January 2003. SFAS 123 establishesaccounting for stock-based compensation that requires all such transactions,including stock options, to be accounted for at fair value and such amounts berecognized in earnings. Adoption of SFAS 123 in January 2003 is estimated toreduce the Firm's net earnings by approximately $0.07 per share in 2003,increasing to $0.20 per share when fully phased in. The FASB recently issued anexposure draft to amend SFAS 123 to allow three alternative methods oftransition to companies that voluntarily change to the fair value method ofaccounting for stock-based employee compensation. JPMorgan Chase is monitoringthe status of the exposure draft and will review the alternatives once they arefinalized to determine the Firm's method of adoption.56 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

JPMorgan Chase is involved in a number of lawsuits andinvestigations arising out of its banking relationships with Enron Corp. andits subsidiaries (&#147;Enron&#148;). The Firm, for and on behalf of Mahonia Limited andMahonia Natural Gas Limited (collectively, &#147;Plaintiffs&#148;) initiated a lawsuitin New York in December 2001 against eleven insurance companies. That suit,which is currently pending in the United States District Court for theSouthern District of New York, seeks payment of $965&nbsp;million underEnron-related surety bonds issued by these companies. The Firm also commenceda lawsuit in London against Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale seeking tocompel payment of $165&nbsp;million under an Enron-related letter of credit issuedby the bank. On March&nbsp;5, 2002,the court in New York denied the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment againstthe insurance companies, ordered discovery, and set a trial date of December2, 2002.66 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)On June&nbsp;28, 2002, Plaintiffs amended the New York complaint to include fraudand breach of contract claims arising out of the defendants' issuance of thesurety bonds, but the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the fraudclaims.Each of the defendant insurance companies has also asserted affirmativedefenses, as well as counterclaims, for misrepresentation and fraud, amongother things, claiming that Plaintiffs misrepresented the nature of theunderlying forward sale contracts for the delivery/supply of natural gas orcrude oil. The defendant insurance companies contend that JPMorgan Chase,Mahonia and Enron misrepresented, concealed and/or withheld material facts,which would have revealed to the defendant insurance companies that theforward sale contracts were actually &#147;disguised&#148; loans without any realdelivery obligations. Based on those defenses, among others, the defendantinsurance companies seek to avoid liability under the surety bonds. Plaintiffshave moved to dismiss the affirmative defenses and counterclaims and havebrought a motion for summary judgment. On November&nbsp;6, 2002, theCourt denied Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment anddismissed all of defendant insurance companies' affirmativedefenses and counterclaims other than those sounding in fraud.Actions involving Enron have also been initiated by other parties againstJPMorgan Chase and its directors and certain of its officers. These lawsuitsinclude a series of purported class actions brought on behalf of shareholdersof Enron, including the lead action captioned Newby v.Enron Corp., and aseries of purported class actions brought on behalf of Enron employees whoparticipated in various employee stock ownership plans, including the leadaction captioned Tittle v. Enron Corp., both of which are pending in Houston.The consolidated complaint filed in Newby names as defendants, among others,JPMorgan Chase, several other investment banking firms, two law firms, Enron'sformer accountants and affiliated entities and individuals and otherindividual defendants, including present and former officers and directors ofEnron and purports to allege claims against JPMorgan Chase and the otherdefendants under federal and state securities laws. The Tittle complaint namesas defendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment bankingfirms, a law firm, Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities andindividuals and other individual defendants, including present and formerofficers and directors of Enron and purports to allege claims against JPMorganChase and certain other defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (&#147;RICO&#148;) and state common law. On May&nbsp;8, 2002, JPMorganChase filed motions to dismiss the Newby and Tittle actions, which motionshave been fully briefed and are currently pending determination by the court.Additional actions against JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates relating to Enronhave been filed. These actions include a consolidated purported class actionlawsuit by JPMorgan Chase stockholders alleging that JPMorgan Chase issuedfalse and misleading press releases and other public documents relating toEnron in violation of Section&nbsp;10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 andRule&nbsp;10b-5 thereunder; purported shareholder derivative actions allegingbreaches of fiduciary duties and alleged failures to exercise due care anddiligence by the Firm's directors and named officers in the management ofJPMorgan Chase; and various actions in disparate courts by Enron investors andcreditors alleging state law and common law claims against JPMorgan Chase andmany other defendants. JPMorgan Chase believes that each of the lawsuits filedagainst the Firm, its affiliates, its directors and named officers is withoutmerit, and the Firm intends to defend each of these actions vigorously.In addition, a number of federal, state and local regulatory and lawenforcement authorities and Congressional committees, and an examinerappointed in the Enron bankruptcy case, have initiated investigations of Enronand of certain of the Firm's financial transactions with Enron. In thatregard, the Firm has delivered, or is currently in the process of delivering,voluntarily and pursuant to subpoena, information to the House Energy andCommerce Committee, the Senate Government Affairs Committee, the SenatePermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. Representative Henry Waxman,the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York, the New York State Banking Department, the New York County DistrictAttorney's Office, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Enron examiner. TheFirm intends to continue to cooperate with these authorities and with suchother agencies and authorities as may request information from JPMorgan Chase.WorldCom litigation. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (&#147;JPMSI&#148;) and JPMorgan Chasehave been named as defendants in fifteen actions that were filed in eitherUnited States District Courts or state courts in six states and the Districtof Columbia and in one arbitral panel beginning in July 2002 arising out ofalleged accounting irregularities in the books and records of WorldCom Inc.Plaintiffs in all but one of these actions are institutional investors,including state pension funds, who purchased debt securities issued byWorldCom pursuant to public offerings in May 2000 and May 2001. JPMSI acted asan underwriter of both of those offerings. In addition to JPMSI and JPMorganChase, the defendants in various of the actions include other underwriters,certain executives of WorldCom and WorldCom's auditors. In the actions,plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or were reckless or negligent innot knowing that the securities were sold to plaintiffs on the basis ofmisrepresentations and omissions of material facts concerning the financialcondition of WorldCom. The complaints against JPMorgan Chase and JPMSI assertclaims under federal and state securities laws, ERISA, other state statutesand under common law theories of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.67 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)Commercial Financial Services litigation. JPMSI (formerly known as ChaseSecurities, Inc.) has been named as a defendant or third-party defendant in 14actions that were filed in or transferred to the United States District Courtfor the Northern District of Oklahoma or filed in Oklahoma state courtbeginning in October 1999 arising out of the failure of Commercial FinancialServices, Inc. (&#147;CFS&#148;). Plaintiffs in these actions are institutionalinvestors who purchased over $1.6&nbsp;billion in original face amount ofasset-backed securities issued by CFS. The securities were backed bydelinquent credit card receivables. In addition to JPMSI, the defendants invarious of the actions are the founders and key executives of CFS, as well asits auditors and outside counsel. JPMSI is alleged to have been the investmentbanker to CFS and to have acted as an initial purchaser and as placement agentin connection with the issuance of certain of the securities. Plaintiffsallege that defendants either knew or were reckless in not knowing that thesecurities were sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleadingmisrepresentations and omissions of material facts. The complaints againstJPMSI assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the OklahomaSecurities Act, and under common law theories of fraud and negligentmisrepresentation. In the actions against JPMSI, damages in the amount ofapproximately $1.6&nbsp;billion allegedly suffered as a result of defendants'misrepresentations and omissions, plus punitive damages, are being claimed.JPMSI also has entered into tolling agreements with certain investors. CFS hascommenced an action against JPMSI in Oklahoma state court and has assertedclaims against JPMSI for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.CFS alleges that JPMSI failed to detect and prevent its insolvency. CFS seeksunspecified damages.IPO Allocation litigation. Beginning in May 2001, JPMorgan Chase and certainof its securities subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous otherfirms in the securities industry, as defendants in a large number of putativeclass action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for theSouthern District of New York. These suits purport to challenge allegedimproprieties in the allocation of stock in various public offerings,including some offerings for which a JPMorgan Chase entity served as anunderwriter. The suits allege violations of securities and antitrust lawsarising from alleged material misstatements and omissions in registrationstatements and prospectuses for the initial public offerings and with respectto aftermarket transactions in the offered securities. The securities claimsallege, among other things, misrepresentations concerning commissions paid toJPMorgan Chase and aftermarket transactions by customers who receivedallocations of shares in the respective initial public offerings. Theantitrust claims allege an illegal conspiracy to require customers, inexchange for initial public offering allocations, to pay undisclosed andexcessive commissions and to make aftermarket purchases of the initial publicoffering securities at a price higher than the offering price as aprecondition to receiving allocation. JPMorgan Chase also has received varioussubpoenas and informal requests from governmental and other agencies seekinginformation relating to initial public offering allocation practices.Recently, JPMSI was advised by the staffs of the National Association ofSecurities Dealers (&#147;NASD&#148;) and the SEC that each was considering recommendingthat disciplinary action be brought concerning activities of one of JPMSI'spredecessor entities (Hambrecht & Quist Group for the NASD; predecessor JPMSIfor the SEC). JPMSI has submitted to the NASD staff a letter outlining thebasis for JPMSI's position that no such action is warranted and is preparing asimilar responsive letter to the SEC.Research Analysts' Conflicts. In connection with its review of theindependence of research analysts, the New York State Attorney General'sOffice, the Texas State Securities Board, the SEC, the NASD, and the New YorkStock Exchange have issued subpoenas and other information requests to severalfinancial services firms, including the Firm. The Firm is cooperating withthis investigation.In addition to the matters described above, JPMorgan Chase and itssubsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various legalactions and proceedings arising in connection with their respective businessesand have been involved from time to time in investigations and proceedings bygovernmental agencies. Other claims, investigations or proceedings may bebrought in the future. Some of the legal actions, proceedings orinvestigations in which the Firm is involved assert claims for amounts thatcould be material to the financial condition of the Firm and could result inadverse judgments, penalties or fines. In view of the inherent difficulty ofpredicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly in cases where theclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, JPMorgan Chase cannotstate with confidence what the eventual outcome of its pending matters willbe, or predict with confidence what the eventual loss or range of lossesrelated to such pending matters will be. JPMorgan Chase anticipates, based onits current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome ofthe pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on theconsolidated financial condition of JPMorgan Chase, but may be material toJPMorgan Chase's operating results for any particular period, depending, amongother things, on the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for such period.Item&nbsp;2 Sales of UnregisteredCommon StockDuring the third quarter of 2002, no shares of common stock of J.P. MorganChase & Co. were issued in transactions exempt from registration under theSecurities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof.68
