In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been included. On January 1, 1995, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" ("SFAS 114"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures" ("SFAS 118"), an amendment to SFAS 114. The adoption of SFAS 114 and SFAS 118 did not have an effect on the Corporation's earnings, liquidity, or capital resources. See Note 4 - Loans on page 10 of this Form 10-Q for further discussion of the Corporation's impaired loans as of and for the three months ended March 31, 1995. NOTE 2 - TRADING ACTIVITIES --------------------------- The Corporation uses its trading assets, such as debt and equity instruments and risk management instruments, to meet the financing needs of its customers and to generate revenues through its trading activities.    7 Part I Item 1. (continued) DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS Trading assets-debt and equity instruments, which are carried at fair value, are presented in the following table for the dates indicated: March 31, December 31, (in millions) 1995 1994 --------- ------------ U.S. Government and Federal Agencies $ 3,269 $ 2,548 Obligations of State and Political Subdivisions 228 327 Certificates of Deposit, Bankers' Acceptances, and Commercial Paper 1,193 1,644 Debt Securities Issued by Foreign Governments 2,761 1,983 Foreign Financial Institutions 2,136 3,119 Other, primarily includes corporate debt and eurodollar bonds 1,313 1,472 ------- ------- Total Trading Assets - Debt and Equity Instruments (a) $10,900 $11,093 ======= ======= [FN] (a) Includes emerging markets instruments of $161 million at March 31, 1995 and $544 million at December 31, 1994. RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS Trading assets-risk management instruments, which totaled $30.0 billion at March 31, 1995, represent unrealized gains on interest rate contracts of $8.3 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $21.4 billion, and stock index options and commodity contracts of $0.3 billion. At December 31, 1994, trading assets-risk management instruments totaled $17.7 billion and represented unrealized gains on interest rate contracts of $7.9 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $9.5 billion, and stock index options and commodity contracts of $0.3 billion. Trading liabilities-risk management instruments, which totaled $31.1 billion at March 31, 1995, represent unrealized losses on interest rate contracts of $9.3 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $21.5 billion, and stock index options and commodity contracts of $0.3 billion. At December 31, 1994 trading liabilities-risk management instruments totaled $16.0 billion and represented unrealized losses on interest rate contracts of $7.0 billion, foreign exchange contracts of $8.9 billion, and stock index options and commodity contracts of $0.1 billion. The increase in the Corporation's risk management instruments at March 31, 1995, when compared with December 31, 1994, was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange related unrealized gains and losses as a result of the recent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, in particular the Deutsche mark and Japanese yen. A description of the classes of derivative and foreign exchange instruments used in the Corporation's trading activities as well as the related accounting policies and the credit risk and market risk factors involved in such activities are disclosed in Note One on page B48 and in Note Nineteen on pages B64-B66 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. For a discussion of the Corporation's risk management instrument activity and related trading revenue for the 1995 first quarter, see Management's Discussion and Analysis on page 23 and pages 37-40 of this Form 10-Q. NOTE 3 - SECURITIES ------------------- Securities that may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors, are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses on these securities, along with any unrealized gains and losses on related hedges, are reported net of applicable taxes in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Securities that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost.    8 Part I Item 1. (continued) The fair valuation of the securities classified as available-for- sale (including loans classified as available-for-sale) resulted in a net after-tax unfavorable impact of $472 million on the Corporation's stockholders' equity at March 31, 1995, compared with a net after-tax unfavorable impact of $438 million at December 31, 1994. The net change from the 1994 year- end was the result of the declining value of Brady Bonds partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate levels at March 31, 1995 compared with December 31, 1994. See Note 4 for further discussion. Net losses from available-for-sale securities sold in the first quarter of 1995 amounted to $18 million (gross gains of $38 million and gross losses of $56 million). Net gains on such sales for the same period in 1994 amounted to $46 million (gross gains of $73 million and gross losses of $27 million). There were no sales of held-to-maturity securities in either first quarter period. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES The amortized cost and estimated fair value of held-to-maturity securities were as follows for the dates indicated:     9 Part I Item 1. (continued) AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities for the dates indicated were as follows:     10 Part I Item 1. (continued) NOTE 4 - LOANS -------------- Certain loans that meet the accounting definition of a security are classified as loans and are measured pursuant to SFAS 115. Bonds that have been issued by foreign governments (such as Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil) to financial institutions, including the Corporation, as part of a debt renegotiation (i.e., "Brady Bonds") are subject to the provisions of SFAS 115. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of loans measured pursuant to SFAS 115 for the dates indicated were as follows: There were no sales of available-for-sale loans in the first quarter of 1995. Cash proceeds from the sales of such loans in the first quarter of 1994 were $318 million. As discussed in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, the Corporation adopted SFAS 114 and SFAS 118 on January 1, 1995 which requires that the carrying value of impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. Under SFAS 114, a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay contractual interest or principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement. SFAS 114 applies to all loans except smaller-balance homogeneous consumer loans, loans carried at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value, debt securities and leases. The Corporation's impaired loans are those non-consumer loans currently reported as nonperforming. The Corporation recognizes interest income on those loans to the extent received in cash. However, where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the loan principal, cash receipts, whether designated as principal or interest, are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. For a further description of the Corporation's accounting policies for recognition of interest income on nonperforming loans, see Note One of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages B48-B51 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.    11 Part I Item 1. (continued) The following table sets forth impaired loan disclosures as of and for the three months ended March 31, 1995. March 31, (in millions) 1995 --------- Impaired Loans with an Allowance $ 665 Impaired Loans without an Allowance (a) 277 ------ Total Impaired Loans $ 942 ====== Allowance for Impaired Loans under SFAS 114 (b) $ 217 ====== Average Balance of Impaired Loans during the Period $ 945 ====== Interest Income Recognized on Impaired Loans during the Period $ 4 ====== [FN] (a) Impaired loans for which the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the carrying value of the loan. Such loans do not require an allowance under SFAS 114. (b) The Allowance for Impaired Loans under SFAS 114 is a part of the Corporation's overall Allowance for Credit Losses. NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE -------------------------------- During the 1995 first quarter, the Corporation repurchased 3.9 million shares of its common stock on the open market under a previously announced plan to repurchase up to 6 million shares in 1995. This follows a stock buyback program of 10 million shares completed in 1994. NOTE 6 - POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS ----------------------------------------------------------- For a discussion of the Corporation's postretirement medical and life insurance benefits provided to domestic employees, reference is made to page B60 of the Corporation's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. On January 1, 1995, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), for postretirement medical benefits related to the Corporation's foreign employees. SFAS 106 requires recognition, during the years of the employees' active service, of the employer's expected cost and obligation of providing postretirement benefits other than pensions to employees and eligible dependents. The Corporation has not prefunded these benefits. Consistent with the January 1, 1993 adoption of SFAS 106 for its domestic employees, the Corporation elected to expense the entire unrecognized accumulated obligation related to its foreign employees via a one-time pre-tax charge of $17 million ($11 million after-tax or $0.05 per common share) on January 1, 1995. During the first quarter of 1995, the Corporation accrued $1 million of periodic expense related to its foreign employees, which is primarily comprised of interest on the accumulated obligation, and also included service cost-benefits earned during the quarter. Prior to January 1, 1995, the Corporation recognized the costs of providing postretirement medical benefits related to its foreign employees on a cash basis.    12 Part I Item 1. (continued) NOTE 7 - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES ------------------------------ In December 1994, the Corporation announced a two-year program to improve earnings per share and return on equity and, as a result, recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $260 million. The charge (which is primarily comprised of cash charges) is related to severance and other termination-related costs of $138 million associated with the elimination of 3,700 positions and costs of $122 million for the disposition of certain facilities, premises and equipment, and the termination of leases. The staff reductions are tied to specific expense reduction initiatives such as commercial lending re-engineering, branch network rationalization and the process improvement program at Texas Commerce and will occur within the Global Bank, Regional Bank, Texas Commerce and Corporate sectors. At March 31, 1995 the reserve balance associated with this charge was approximately $227 million of which $112 million related to severance and other termination-related costs and $115 million related to the disposition of certain facilities, premises and equipment and termination of leases. During 1994, the Corporation also included in noninterest expense a restructuring charge of $48 million related to the closing of 50 New York branches and a staff reduction of 650. This restructuring charge primarily comprises real estate costs and severance costs associated with the closing of the 50 New York branches. Also included in the restructuring charge are severance costs involved in optimizing the branch staff at existing branches. This rationalization of the branch system is part of an ongoing Corporate-wide program to improve productivity. At March 31, 1995, the reserve balance associated with this restructuring charge was approximately $23 million (of which $22 million related to the pending disposition of certain facilities). At March 31, 1995, remaining reserve balances (associated with the pending disposition of facilities) related to 1993 restructuring charges were immaterial. NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES -------------------------------------- For a discussion of certain legal proceedings, see Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings. After reviewing with counsel all actions and proceedings pending against or involving the Corporation and its subsidiaries, management does not expect the aggregate liability or loss, if any, resulting therefrom to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of the Corporation. NOTE 9 - DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -------------------------------------------------------------- The Corporation utilizes various derivative and foreign exchange financial instruments for trading purposes and for purposes other than trading, such as asset/liability management. These financial instruments represent contracts with counterparties where payments are made to or from the counterparty based upon specific interest rates, currency levels, other market rates or on terms predetermined by the contract. Such derivative and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varying degrees, credit risk and market risk. A discussion of the credit and market risks involved with derivative and foreign exchange financial instruments is provided on pages B31-B34 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR TRADING PURPOSES: The financial instruments used for the Corporation's trading activities are disclosed in Note 2 of this Form 10-Q. The amount of credit risk regarding the Corporation's trading activities is disclosed on the balance sheet in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39 ("FASI 39"). These amounts are disclosed in Note 2 of this Form 10-Q. The effects of market risk (gains or losses) on the Corporation's trading activities have been reflected in trading revenue, as the trading instruments are marked-to-market on a daily basis. DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING: The Corporation's principal objective in using off- balance sheet instruments for purposes other than trading is for its asset/liability management. The majority of the Corporation's derivatives used for such activities are transacted through its trading units. A discussion of the Corporation's objectives and strategies for employing derivative and foreign exchange instruments for asset/liability management activities is included on page B34 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.    13 Part I Item 1. (continued) At March 31, 1995, gross deferred gains and gross deferred losses relating to closed financial futures contracts used in asset/liability management activities were $24 million and $63 million, respectively. Deferred gains and losses on closed financial futures contracts are generally amortized over periods ranging up to twelve months. The amortization periods are dependent upon when the contract is closed and the period of time over which the asset or liability is being hedged. The Corporation does not generally terminate its interest rate swaps; however, during the 1995 first quarter, certain swaps were terminated. As of March 31, 1995, gross deferred gains and gross deferred losses related to terminated interest rate swap contracts were $2 million and $35 million, respectively. The Corporation generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge anticipated transactions. Accordingly, at March 31, 1995, deferred gains and losses associated with such transactions were immaterial.    14 Part I Item 1. (continued) The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts as well as the credit exposure related to these instruments (after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements) for the dates indicated below. The table should be read in conjunction with the preceding narrative as well as the descriptions of these products and their risks included on pages B65-B66 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. In addition to the financial instruments presented in the preceding notional table, the Corporation also enters into transactions involving "when-issued securities" primarily as part of its trading activities. When-issued securities are commitments to purchase or sell securities authorized for issuance, but not yet actually issued. Accordingly, they are not recorded on the balance sheet until issued. At March 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, commitments to purchase when-issued securities were $5,440 million and $6,289 million, respectively, and commitments to sell when-issued securities were $5,484 million and $6,658 million, respectively.    15 Part I Item 1. (continued) Derivatives and foreign exchange products are generally either negotiated over-the-counter ("OTC") contracts or standardized contracts executed on a recognized exchange (such as the Chicago Board of Options Exchange). Standardized exchange-traded derivatives primarily include futures and options. Negotiated over-the-counter derivatives are generally entered into between two counterparties that negotiate specific agreement terms, including the underlying instrument, amount, exercise price and maturity. All of the Corporation's interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are OTC-traded and all of the Corporation's financial futures contracts are exchange-traded. As of March 31, 1995, approximately 33% of the Corporation's options activity was exchange-traded, with the balance being OTC-traded. As of December 31, 1994, approximately 19% of the Corporation's options activity was exchange-traded, with the balance being OTC-traded. The percentage of options activity that is exchange-traded versus OTC- traded will vary depending upon conditions in the market place. NOTE 10 - OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------------- The following table summarizes the Corporation's credit risk which is represented by contract amounts relating to lending-related financial instruments at March 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994. The table should be read in conjunction with the description of these products and their risks included on pages B66-B67 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ------------------------------------------------------------------ March 31, December 31, (in millions) 1995 1994 --------- ------------ Commitments to Extend Credit $ 52,431(a) $ 49,266(a) Standby Letters of Credit (Net of Risk Participations of $5,014 and $5,218) 12,222 12,451 Other Letters of Credit 3,099 2,860 Customers' Securities Lent 18,565 18,979 ------------------------------------------------------------------ (a) Excludes credit card commitments of $19.6 billion and $19.0 billion at March 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994, respectively. ------------------------------------------------------------------ NOTE 11 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS --------------------------------------------- For a discussion of the Corporation's fair value methodologies, see pages B67-B69 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994. At March 31, 1995, the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial assets required to be valued for purposes of SFAS 107 were $180.0 billion and $181.0 billion, respectively, compared with $166.0 billion and $166.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 1994. At March 31, 1995, the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial liabilities required to be valued for purposes of SFAS 107 were $173.9 billion and $174.4 billion, respectively, compared with $160.2 billion and $160.8 billion at December 31, 1994.    16 Part I Item 1. (continued) The following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value at March 31, 1995 of financial assets and liabilities valued under SFAS 107 and certain derivatives contracts (which are primarily interest rate swaps) used for asset/liability management ("ALM") activities related to such financial assets and liabilities. Certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of SFAS 107. Therefore, in addition to the derivative contracts in the above table, the Corporation also uses derivative contracts (primarily interest rate floors) to hedge its purchased mortgage servicing rights which are not required to be fair valued under SFAS 107. At March 31, 1995, the notional amount of such derivatives was $2.4 billion, the carrying value was $4.8 million, and the gross unrecognized gains and losses of such derivatives were $0.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, resulting in an estimated fair value of $3.2 million. The above table does not include futures contracts which the Corporation uses in its ALM activities to modify the interest rate characteristics of balance sheet instruments such as securities, loans and deposits. Gross deferred gains and losses from daily margin settlements on open futures contracts were $1 million and $56 million, respectively, at March 31, 1995. The deferred gains and losses from open futures contracts are amortized to income after the contracts close. See page 13 of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of closed futures contracts related to ALM activities.    17 Part I Item 2.
