(continued) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATIONThe unaudited financial statements of The Chase Manhattan Corporation andsubsidiaries (the "Corporation") are prepared in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles for interim financial information. In the opinionof management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results ofoperations for the interim periods presented have been included. In addition,certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.The Corporation adopted, commencing January 1, 1997, the requirements ofStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125 entitled, "Accounting forTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities"("SFAS 125"), for the following types of transactions: securitizations,recognitions of servicing assets and liabilities, transfers of receivables withrecourse, loan participations, and extinguishments of liabilities. The adoptionof SFAS 125 did not have a material effect on the Corporation's earnings,liquidity, or capital resources.In December 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issuedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 127 entitled, "Deferral of theEffective Date of Certain Provisions of FASB Statement No. 125" ("SFAS 127"),which deferred for one year, the effective date of SFAS 125 as applied tosecurities lending, repurchase agreements and other secured financingtransactions. The Corporation believes that the adoption of SFAS 127 will nothave a material effect on the Corporation's earnings, liquidity or capitalresources.NOTE 2- EARNINGS PER SHAREFor a discussion of the Corporation's current earnings per share policy,reference is made to Note One of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended December 31, 1996 ("1996 Annual Report").

Excluding these items, net income was $1,737 million, primary earnings per share was $3.66, fully-diluted earnings per share was $3.62 and return on common stockholders' equity was 18.48%. -16-  17Certain forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to risks anduncertainties. The Corporation's actual results may differ materially from thoseset forth in such forward-looking statements. Reference is made to theCorporation's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, inparticular the Form 8-K dated July 15, 1997, and the Corporation's Annual Reportto Stockholders on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1996 (the "1996Annual Report") for a discussion of factors that may cause such differences tooccur.OVERVIEWThe Chase Manhattan Corporation (the "Corporation") reported second quarter 1997operating net income of $969 million, compared with second quarter 1996 resultsof $870 million. Primary earnings per share ("primary EPS") in the secondquarter of 1997 were $2.11, compared with $1.83 in the same 1996 period. Fullydiluted earnings per share ("fully-diluted EPS") in the second quarter of 1997were $2.11, a 16% increase from $1.82 in the comparable 1996 quarter. The returnon common stockholders' equity on an operating basis was 20.2% for the secondquarter of 1997 versus 19.0% for the comparable period of 1996. Operating netincome excludes merger-related restructuring costs in both periods. Reported netincome in the 1997 second quarter was $925 million, compared with $856 millionin the prior-year second quarter. Primary and fully-diluted EPS were both $2.00in 1997, compared with $1.80 and $1.79, respectively, in 1996.The Corporation's operating net income for the first six months of 1997 was$1,915 million, compared with $1,737 million for the same 1996 period. Primaryand fully-diluted EPS for the first six months of 1997 were $4.13 and $4.11,respectively, compared with $3.66 and $3.62, respectively, for the same periodsof 1996. Operating net income excludes merger-related restructuring costs inboth periods and the net effect of favorable nonrecurring items totaling $70million in the first quarter of 1996. Reported net income for the first sixmonths of 1997 was $1,852 million compared with $767 million for 1996. Primaryand fully-diluted EPS were $3.99 and $3.97, respectively, for the first sixmonths of 1997, compared with $1.48 and $1.46, respectively, for the same 1996period.The Corporation's total operating revenue (which excludes nonrecurring items)for the 1997 second quarter was $4,140 million, an increase of 5% from the same1996 period. For the first six months of 1997, total operating revenue increasedto $8,246 million or 3% from the comparable 1996 period. On a managed basis,which excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, total operatingrevenue for the 1997 second quarter increased 7% to $4,410 million and for the1997 six months increased 6% to $8,748 million.The 1997 second quarter included incremental merger savings of $185 million,which were offset by investment spending and increased incentive costs relatedto strong trading results. The quarter also included restructuring expenses of$71 million, bringing cumulative restructuring expenses to $265 million. TheCorporation currently expects that merger-related expenses will rise $100million to $125 million from its previous estimate of $250 million.The Corporation's efficiency ratio improved to 58.0% for the second quarter of1997, compared with 58.4% for the comparable 1996 period. Excluding the impactof credit card securitizations, the efficiency ratio for the second quarters of1997 and 1996 was 54.4% and 56.2%, respectively.The Corporation remains on track to achieve its 1997 financial goals, includingannual earnings per share growth of 15%; return on common equity of 19%; anefficiency ratio of between 54% to 55% and incremental merger savings of $635million to $680 million. The Corporation continues to target annual managedrevenue growth of six to eight percent; however, due to investment spending intargeted growth businesses, the Corporation currently expects the growth inunderlying noninterest operating expense (before merger savings) for the fullyear to exceed six percent.During the 1997 second quarter, the Corporation purchased approximately 6.7million common shares as part of a stock repurchase plan announced in October of1996. The Corporation also reissued approximately 1.7 million treasury sharesunder the Corporation's employee benefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of5.0 million shares of its common stock. During the period from the inception ofthe program through June 30, 1997, the Corporation has repurchased 24.3 millioncommon shares ($2.3 billion) and reissued approximately 6.9 million treasuryshares under the Corporation's benefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of17.4 million shares ($1.8 billion) of its common stock. -17-  18RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNET INTEREST INCOMEReported net interest income for the 1997 second quarter was $1,982 million,down $23 million from the 1996 second quarter. For the first six months,reported net interest income was $4,033 million in 1997, a decrease of $122million from the 1996 level. The 1996 first six months included $54 million ofinterest income related to Federal and State tax audit settlements. Excludingthe impact of securitizations and the 1996 tax audit settlements, net interestincome on a managed basis increased 3% in both the 1997 second quarter and firstsix months reflecting a higher level of liquid interest-earning assets tosupport the Corporation's trading businesses.(a) Excludes $54 million of interest income related to tax audit settlements which was considered a nonrecurring item.(b) Reflected on a taxable equivalent basis in order to permit comparison of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets. For net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis, and additional information on average balances and rates, see the Average Balance Sheets on pages 45 and 46.The reported and managed net yields on average interest-earning assets decreasedin the 1997 second quarter and first six months compared with the same 1996periods. The declines in net yield are primarily due to a higher level of liquidassets, driven by the Corporation's trading businesses, and narrower spreads oninterest-earning assets. -18-  19Average interest-earning assets retained on the balance sheet increased by 11%in the second quarter of 1997 and 8% in the first six months of 1997, whencompared with the same 1996 periods, principally as a result of the increase inliquid interest-earning assets. Liquid interest-earning assets (in particulartrading-related assets) increased in the 1997 second quarter and first sixmonths by 30% and 23%, respectively, versus the same 1996 periods. Both averagetotal loans and securities also increased slightly in both 1997 periods, butdecreased as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. The growth ininterest-earning assets in the 1997 second quarter and first six months waslargely funded by an increase in Federal funds purchased and securities soldunder repurchase agreements, which provide short-term funding fortrading-related positions.Management anticipates that, given its current expectations for interest ratemovements in 1997, the Corporation's managed net interest income in 1997 will beapproximately 3% higher than in 1996 (excluding the impact of tax auditsettlements in 1996).PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe Corporation's provision for credit losses, which has equaled netcharge-offs, amounted to $189 million in the 1997 second quarter and $409million for the first six months of 1997, compared with $250 million and $495million, respectively, for the prior year's periods. The decreases in theprovision were the result of lower commercial net charge-offs. Consumer netcharge-offs on a retained basis remained relatively constant.Management currently expects that the provision for credit losses for full-year1997 (which is anticipated to continue to equal net charge-offs) will be equalto or lower than the full-year 1996 provision, primarily as a result of thecontinued strong performance in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio andthe effects of expected credit card securitizations in the latter half of theyear. For a discussion of the Corporation's net charge-offs, see the Credit RiskManagement Section on pages 30-36.NONINTEREST REVENUENoninterest revenue increased 11% for both the 1997 second quarter and six monthperiods across a broad spectrum of fee-based and market sensitive categories,when compared with each of the corresponding 1996 periods. The Corporationcontinues to generate overall fee growth by offering clients integratedfinancing and advisory solutions and new products and by generating newbusiness. Noninterest revenue in the first half of 1997 included a $44 milliongain on the sale of a partially-owned foreign investment and in 1996 included a$60 million loss on the sale of a building in Japan. -19-  20The following table presents the components of noninterest revenue for theperiods indicated.FEES AND COMMISSIONSCorporate finance and syndication fees were a record $274 million in the 1997second quarter, rebounding sharply from the first quarter 1997 level of $168million and increasing by $16 million from the previous record level in theprior-year's second quarter. During the 1997 second quarter, investment bankingdeal flow increased across the full range of market and customer segments andrevenues from securities underwriting grew as the volume of lead mandatesincreased in active high-yield and investment grade markets. While the 1997first half reflects substantial growth in fees from securities underwriting andother new business initiatives, first half 1997 fees were lower than the 1996first half as less activity in the leveraged lending market in the 1997 firstquarter adversely impacted fee opportunities as well as 1996 results being favorably impacted by several significant transactions.Trust, custody and investment management fees rose 6% to $321 million in the1997 second quarter and rose 7% to $631 million in the 1997 first six monthswhen compared with the same 1996 periods. These favorable results were largelythe result of growth in assets under custody, new business initiatives,increased investment advisory activities, and appreciated market valuesresulting in a higher level of assets under management, including in theCorporation's proprietary Vista mutual funds.(a) Represents fees for trustee, agency, registrar, securities lending, broker clearings, safekeeping and maintenance of securities.(b) Represents fees for trustee, estate services, custody, advisory and investment management.(c) Represents administrative, custody, trustee and other fees in connection with the Corporation's proprietary mutual funds.Credit card revenue rose $15 million to $248 million in the 1997 second quarterand increased 13% for the first six months of 1997, as a result of growth inmanaged outstandings, including the new Wal-mart co-branded product. Theincrease in revenue for both 1997 periods was partially offset by a rise in netcharge-offs on the securitized portfolio which reduces the excess servicing feesthe Corporation receives from the securitizations. Average managed credit cardreceivables (credit card receivables on the balance sheet plus securitizedcredit card receivables) grew to $25.6 billion in the second quarter of 1997,when compared with $23.3 billion for the prior year's comparable period. For afurther discussion of the credit card portfolio and related securitizationactivity, see pages 32-33 of this Form 10-Q. -20-  21The following table presents the components of fees for other financial servicesfor the periods indicated.The higher levels of mortgage servicing fees for both 1997 periods reflect anincrease in mortgage servicing volume largely resulting from the acquisition ofthe Source One Mortgage Services Corporation's ("Source One") portfolio inFebruary 1997.TRADING REVENUEThe following table sets forth the components of trading revenue for the secondquarter and first six months of 1997 and 1996.(a) Net interest income attributable to trading activities includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in the net interest income caption on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(b) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures, and forward rate agreements and related hedges.(c) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.(d) Includes U.S. and foreign government and government agency securities, corporate debt securities, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives, equity securities, equity derivatives, and commodity derivatives.Trading-related revenues for the 1997 second quarter were at a record level, up26% from the 1996 second quarter, as a result of a very strong performanceacross the breadth of the Corporation's trading and sales platforms amidfavorable market conditions. The Corporation benefited from active market makingand client business in its traditional foreign exchange and interest rateactivities, strong growth in specialty derivative products and continued highlevels of securities trading and underwriting.The increase in revenue from interest rate contracts was primarily due to highervolume as a result of volatility exhibited in the overseas markets, inparticular, Europe. The rise in foreign exchange revenue represented strongearnings across a broad spectrum of currencies, as well as an increase incross-currency trading activity in the European markets caused by uncertainty asto the integration of the European Monetary System. Debt instruments and otherrevenue remained at high levels, primarily as a result of strong performances inboth emerging markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe and in the U.S.securities business. -21-  22Trading revenues are affected by many factors, including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by theCorporation on behalf of its customers, the Corporation's success in proprietarypositioning, the credit standing of the Corporation, and the steps taken bycentral banks and governments which affect financial markets. The Corporationexpects its trading revenues will fluctuate as these factors will vary fromperiod to period.OTHER NONINTEREST REVENUEThe following table presents securities gains, revenue from equity-relatedinvestments and the composition of other revenue for the periods indicated.The securities gains resulted from sales from the available-for-sale portfolio,made in connection with the Corporation's asset/liability management activities.The higher gains in 1997 were primarily the result of sales of U.S. Governmentand agency securities in the 1997 second quarter and of securities overseas inthe 1997 first quarter.Revenue from equity-related investments, which includes income from venturecapital activities and emerging markets investments, was $179 million in the1997 second quarter, higher than the recent quarterly average (approximately$163 million per quarter for the previous eight quarters), but $40 million lowerthan the strong results reported in the 1996 second quarter. For the first sixmonths of 1997, revenue from equity-related investments was $343 million,compared with $442 million for the 1996 first half. These decreases were largelythe result of a number of large deals recorded in the 1996 first half. At June30, 1997, the Corporation had equity-related investments with a carrying valueof approximately $3.0 billion. The Corporation believes that equity-relatedinvestments will continue to make contributions to the Corporation's earningsalthough the timing of the recognition of gains from these activities isunpredictable and revenues from such activities could vary significantly fromperiod to period.Other revenue increased $93 million in the 1997 second quarter and $239 millionfor the first six months, when compared with the prior year's periods. The 1997results included higher residential mortgage origination and sales revenueresulting from favorable secondary market conditions and higher gains onportfolio sales. In addition, the 1996 second quarter and six-month resultsincluded net losses on the disposition of available-for-sale emerging marketssecurities of $30 million and $65 million, respectively. The 1997 six-monthresults also included a $44 million gain on the sale of a non-strategic,partially-owned foreign investment, while the 1996 first half results included a$60 million loss on the sale of a building in Japan.All other revenue also includes the Corporation's investment in CIT GroupHoldings, Inc., which contributed revenue of $18 million in the second quarterand $32 million for the first six months of 1997, compared with $14 million and$25 million in the respective 1996 periods.NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense, excluding restructuring costs, was $2,400 million in the1997 second quarter, an increase of 4% from the prior year's quarter, and was$4,817 million for the first half of 1997, an increase of 2% from the same 1996period. The 1997 results for both periods included investment spending on newproduct offerings and technology as well as higher incentive costs related tostrong trading results. Partially offsetting these expenses were incrementalmerger savings of $185 million and $390 million, respectively, in the 1997second quarter and first six months. -22-  23For the 1997 second quarter and first six months, growth in underlying operatingnoninterest expense (which excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed propertyexpense, nonrecurring items and expenses associated with preferred stockdividends issued by a real estate investment trust ("REIT") subsidiary of theCorporation, before giving effect to the merger-related cost savings) was 11%and 9%, respectively. Management of the Corporation believes that underlyingnoninterest expense growth for the full year of 1997 will exceed 6% due toinvestment spending in targeted growth businesses.(a) The computation of the efficiency ratio (noninterest expense as a percentage of the total of net interest income and noninterest revenue) excludes restructuring costs, foreclosed property expense, and nonrecurring items. Nonrecurring items in the first half of 1997 included the gain on a sale of a non-strategic, partially-owned foreign investment and costs due to the accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards. Nonrecurring items in the first six months of 1996 included aggregate tax benefits and refunds, loss on a sale of a building in Japan and costs incurred in combining the Corporation's foreign retirement plans.SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITSThe increase in salaries for the 1997 second quarter and first six months wasprimarily due to higher incentive costs as a result of strong trading results.Also contributing to the increase in salaries for the 1997 six month period was$50 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of 1997 for the acceleratedvesting of stock-based incentive awards as a result of the improvement in theCorporation's stock price.The following table presents the Corporation's full-time equivalent employees atthe dates indicated.The slight increase in full-time equivalent employees since December 31, 1996reflects planned growth in selected businesses.Employee benefits in the 1997 second quarter and first six months decreased by$6 million and $89 million, respectively, from the comparable periods in 1996.Included in the results for the first six months of 1996 was a $40 millioncharge related to conforming retirement benefits provided to foreign employees.Contributing to the decline in employee benefits during 1997 were lower socialsecurity expenses associated with a lower volume of employee stock options beingexercised during 1997, and to a lesser extent, a slight decline in staff levelsfrom the prior year period, which reduced medical costs and other staffbenefits.OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSEOccupancy expense in the 1997 second quarter and first six months decreased by$14 million and $48 million, respectively, largely as a result of theconsolidation of operations and branch facilities from merger integrationefforts. The higher level of equipment expense was primarily the result ofincreased software expenses to enhance processing systems throughout theCorporation, and technology expenditures necessary to support targeted growthbusinesses. -23-  24RESTRUCTURING CHARGE AND EXPENSESIn connection with the merger of The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("Chase") andChemical Banking Corporation ("Chemical"), $1.9 billion of one-timemerger-related costs were identified, of which $1.65 billion was taken as arestructuring charge on March 31, 1996. The remaining merger-related expensesoriginally estimated at $250 million, did not qualify for immediate recognitionunder an existing accounting pronouncement and were not included in the $1.65billion charge. Merger-related expenses of $71 million were incurred in thesecond quarter 1997, resulting in cumulative to date merger-related expenses of$265 million.The Corporation currently expects that merger-related expenses will rise by $100million to $125 million from its previous estimate of $250 million. Theseadditional costs primarily relate to technology and systems integration costs,most of which are expected to be incurred by year-end 1997.At June 30, 1997, the reserve balance associated with the merger-related $1.65billion restructuring charge was approximately $675 million, of which $187million related to severance and other termination-related costs, $442 millionrelated to the disposition of certain facilities, premises and equipment, and$46 million related to other merger costs, including costs to eliminateredundant back office and other operations.OTHER EXPENSEThe following table presents the components of other expense for the periodsindicated.Other expense for the 1997 second quarter and first six months increased by $34million and $65 million, respectively, when compared with the second quarter andfirst six months of 1996. The increase reflected expenses of $25 million and $48million, for the respective periods, related to marketing and other costs forthe co-branded Wal-Mart MasterCard and approximately $11 million per quarter ofminority interest expense associated with the REIT, both of which commenced inthe 1996 fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these increases were lowertelecommunications expenses of $9 million and $19 million in the 1997 secondquarter and first six months, respectively, due to the Corporation's sourcingand other expense-reduction initiatives.INCOME TAXESThe Corporation recognized income tax expense of $555 million in the secondquarter of 1997, compared with $524 million in the second quarter of 1996. Forthe first six months, the Corporation recorded income tax expense of $1,111million in 1997, compared with $310 million in 1996.

Theincrease reflected higher corporate finance and loan syndication fees, asinvestment banking deal flow increased across the full range of market andcustomer segments.

For the first six months of1997, net income of $315 million decreased $37 million compared with the sameperiod in 1996 due to a decline in net interest income and from less activity inthe leveraged loan market in the first quarter of 1997 adversely impacting feeopportunities.

Earnings for thefirst six months of 1997 were driven by a 14% revenue increase generated fromgrowth in average managed receivables and the effects of higher fees andrisk-based pricing initiatives. These revenues were more than offset by highercredit card charge-offs and expenses related to the launch of the Wal-Martco-branded credit card.RETAIL PAYMENTS & INVESTMENTSAt June 30, 1997, Retail Payments and Investments has the leading share ofprimary bank relationships among consumers and small businesses in the New Yorkmetropolitan tri-state area.

For the first six months of 1997, thepercentage of domestic residential mortgage net charge-offs to average loanoutstandings was 0.07%, down from 0.09% for the same 1996 period.The following table presents the residential mortgage servicing portfolioactivity for the periods indicated. A discussion of the Corporation's mortgageservicing and loan origination activities is included on pages 49-50 of theCorporation's 1996 Annual Report.(a) Represents acquisition of Source One servicing portfolio in February 1997.Mortgage servicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $1,767 millionat June 30, 1997, compared with $1,404 million at December 31, 1996, reflectingthe corresponding increase in the Corporation's residential mortgage servicingportfolio due to the acquisition of Source One servicing portfolio in February1997.

Managementcurrently expects that credit card net charge-offs have peaked in the secondquarter of 1997 and will decline in the third and fourth quarters. Additionally,management expects that the Corporation's credit card net charge-offs, as apercentage of average managed credit card receivables, will be approximately5.6% to 5.7% for the full year 1997.Credit Card Securitizations: For a discussion of the Corporation's credit cardsecuritizations, see page 51 of the Corporation's 1996 Annual Report.The following table outlines the impact of the securitizations of credit cardreceivables by showing the favorable (unfavorable) change in the reportedConsolidated Statement of Income line items for the periods indicated.Auto Financings: The auto financings portfolio, which consists of auto loans andleases, was $11.6 billion at June 30, 1997 and $11.1 billion at December 31,1996. The increase reflected continued strong consumer demand due to favorablepricing programs, partially offset by the impact of auto loan securitizations.Total originations were $5.0 billion in the first half of 1997, compared with$6.4 billion in the same 1996 period. The Corporation securitized approximately$2.1 billion of auto loans during the first six months of 1997, compared with$1.5 billion during the first six months of 1996. Net charge-offs related toauto financings were $15 million in the 1997 second quarter, compared with $7million in the same period in 1996. For the first six months, net charge-offs ofauto financings were $27 million in 1997, compared with $15 million in 1996. Theincreased level of net charge-offs related to auto financings in both 1997periods primarily reflects growth in the portfolio and unfavorable performancein a discontinued product line.Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans, which includes secured installmentloans (primarily loans related to recreational vehicles and manufactured housingfinancing), student loans and unsecured revolving lines of credit, were $9.3billion at June 30, 1997, compared with $9.2 billion at December 31, 1996. Theincrease in net charge-offs for the 1997 second quarter and first six monthsreflects higher personal bankruptcies related to unsecured revolving lines ofcredit when compared with the same periods in 1996. -33-  34DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIODomestic Commercial and Industrial Portfolio: The domestic commercial andindustrial portfolio totaled $36.6 billion at June 30, 1997, an increase from$34.7 billion at December 31, 1996. The portfolio consists primarily of loansmade to large corporate and middle market customers and is diversifiedgeographically and by industry.Nonperforming domestic commercial and industrial loans were $344 million at June30, 1997, compared with $444 million at December 31, 1996. In the second quarterand first six months of 1997, the Corporation had net charge-offs of $4 millionand $18 million, respectively, compared with $46 million and $94 million in thesame 1996 periods.Management expects commercial and industrial loan net charge-offs for full-year1997 to be equal to or lower than the 1996 full-year level, primarily as aresult of the continued strong performance in the commercial and industrial loanportfolio.Domestic Commercial Real Estate Portfolio: The domestic commercial real estateportfolio represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loanssecured by one-to-four family residential properties (which are included in theconsumer loan portfolio). The domestic commercial real estate loan portfoliototaled $5.7 billion at June 30, 1997, slightly lower when compared with $5.9billion at December 31, 1996. The decrease reflects sales primarily in theterminal commercial real estate portfolio during the second quarter of 1997.The table below sets forth the major components of the domestic commercial realestate loan portfolio at the dates indicated.Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate loans were $176 million at June30, 1997, a $20 million increase from the December 31, 1996 level.Domestic Financial Institutions Portfolio: The domestic financial institutionsportfolio includes loans to commercial banks and companies whose businessesprimarily involve lending, financing, investing, underwriting, or insurance.Loans to domestic financial institutions were $5.6 billion, or 3% of total loansoutstanding, at June 30, 1997, essentially consistent with $5.5 billion atDecember 31, 1996. The portfolio continued to maintain its strong credit qualityduring the first half of 1997, with no net charge-offs.FOREIGN PORTFOLIOForeign portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, loans to financialinstitutions, commercial real estate, loans to foreign governments and officialinstitutions, and consumer loans. At June 30, 1997, the Corporation's totalforeign loans were $41.2 billion, compared with $39.8 billion at December 31,1996. The portfolio included foreign commercial and industrial loans of $26.3billion at June 30, 1997, an increase of $3.2 billion from the 1996 year-end.Foreign nonperforming loans at June 30, 1997 were $124 million, a decrease of$11 million from December 31, 1996. Net charge-offs of foreign loans were $1million in the 1997 second quarter, compared with net recoveries of $18 millionin the 1996 second quarter. For the first six months, net charge-offs were $2million in 1997, compared with net recoveries of $27 million in 1996.INDUSTRY DIVERSIFICATIONBased upon the industry classifications utilized by the Corporation at June 30,1997, there were no industry segments which exceeded 5% of total Commercial andIndustrial loans outstanding.DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the normal course of its business, the Corporation utilizes variousderivative and foreign exchange financial instruments to meet the financialneeds of its customers, to generate revenues through its trading activities, andto manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates. For adiscussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instruments utilizedin connection with the Corporation's trading activities and asset/liabilitymanagement activities, including the notional amounts and credit exposureoutstandings as well as the credit and market risks involved, see Notes 3 and 10of this Form 10-Q and pages 52-58 and Notes One and Seventeen of theCorporation's 1996 Annual Report. -34-  35Many of the Corporation's derivative and foreign exchange contracts areshort-term, which mitigates credit risk as transactions settle quickly. Thefollowing table provides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreignexchange contracts outstanding at June 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996.Percentages are based upon remaining contract life of mark-to-market exposureamounts.The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchangetransactions with regulated financial institutions, which the Corporationbelieves have relatively low credit risk. At June 30, 1997, approximately 86% ofthe mark-to-market exposure of such transactions was with commercial bank andfinancial institution counterparties, most of which are dealers in theseproducts. Nonfinancial institutions accounted for approximately 14% of theCorporation's derivative and foreign exchange mark-to-market exposure.Additionally, at June 30, 1997 and 1996, nonperforming derivatives contractswere immaterial.The Corporation does not deal, to any significant extent, in derivatives, whichdealers of derivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions) considerto be "leveraged". As a result, the mark-to-market exposure as well as thenotional amount of such derivatives were insignificant at June 30, 1997.ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses is available to absorb potential credit lossesfrom the entire loan portfolio, as well as derivative and foreign exchangecontracts, letters of credit, guarantees and undrawn legal commitments. As ofJune 30, 1997, the allowance for credit losses has been allocated into threecomponents: a $3,446 million allowance for loan losses, which is reported net inLoans; a $75 million allowance for credit losses on derivative and foreignexchange financial instruments, which is reported net in Trading Assets-RiskManagement Instruments; and a $170 million allowance for credit losses onletters of credit, guarantees and undrawn legal commitments, which is reportedin Other Liabilities. During the 1997 first six months, there were no provisionsor charge-offs made to either the allowance for credit losses on derivatives andforeign exchange financial instruments or the allowance for credit losses onletters of credit, guarantees and undrawn legal commitments. However, there wasa transfer of $100 million from the allowance for loan losses to the allowancefor credit losses on letters of credit, guarantees and undrawn legal commitmentsduring the 1997 second quarter as a result of the inclusion of undrawn legalcommitments in the evaluation of the allowance. The 1996 amounts have not beenreclassified due to immateriality.The Corporation deems its allowance for credit losses at June 30, 1997 to beadequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that may currently exist in theportfolio, but are not yet identifiable). Estimating potential future losses isinherently uncertain and depends on many factors, including generalmacroeconomic and political conditions, rating migration, structural changeswithin industries which alter competitive positions, event risk, unexpectedcorrelations within the portfolio, and other external factors such as legal andregulatory requirements. The Corporation periodically reviews such factors andreassesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. -35-  36The accompanying table reflects the activity in the Corporation's allowance forloan losses for the periods indicated.The following table presents the Corporation's allowance for loan lossescoverage ratios. -36-  37MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of the Corporation's market risk management focusesprimarily on developments since December 31,1996 and should be read inconjunction with pages 54-58 and Notes One and Seventeen of the Corporation's1996 Annual Report.TRADING ACTIVITIESMeasuring Market Risk: Market risk is measured and monitored on a daily basisthrough a value-at-risk ("VAR") methodology, which captures the potentialovernight dollar loss from adverse market movements. The quantification ofmarket risk through a VAR methodology requires a number of key assumptionsincluding confidence level for losses, number of days of price history, holdingperiod, measurement of inter-business correlation, and the treatment of risksoutside the VAR methodology, such as event risk and liquidity risk. [SEE GRAPH NUMBER 1 AT APPENDIX 1]The preceding chart contains a histogram of the Corporation's daily marketrisk-related revenue. Market risk-related revenue is defined as the daily changein value in marked-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related netinterest income or other revenue. Net interest income related to funding andinvestment activity is excluded. Based on actual trading results for the twelvemonths ended June 30, 1997, which captures the historical correlation amongbusiness units, 95% of the variation in the Corporation's daily trading resultsfell within a $28 million band centered on the daily average amount of $9million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 1997, the Corporation postedpositive daily market risk-related revenue for 245 out of 259 business tradingdays for international and domestic units. For 204 of the 259 days, theCorporation's daily market risk-related revenue or losses occurred within thenegative $5 million through positive $15 million range, which is representativeof the Corporation's emphasis on market-making, sales and arbitrage activities.ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIESThe Corporation's interest rate risk profile is generally managed withconsideration for both total return and reported earnings. Interest rate riskarises from a variety of factors, including differences in the timing betweenthe contractual maturity or repricing (the "repricing") of the Corporation'sassets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as the repricingcharacteristics of its loans and other assets do not necessarily match those ofits deposits, other borrowings and capital. The Corporation, as part of its ALMprocess, employs a variety of cash (primarily securities) and derivativeinstruments in managing its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates.Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity:In managing exposure, the Corporation uses quantifications of net gap exposure,measurements of earnings at risk based on net interest income simulations, andvaluation sensitivity measures. An example of aggregate net gap analysis ispresented below. Assets, liabilities and derivative instruments are placed ingap intervals based on their repricing dates. Assets and liabilities for whichno specific contractual repricing or maturity dates exist or whose contractualmaturities do not reflect their expected maturities are placed in gap intervalsbased on management's judgment and statistical analysis concerning their mostlikely repricing behaviors. Derivatives used in interest rate sensitivitymanagement are also included in the applicable gap intervals.A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilitiesrepricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negative gap - moreliabilities repricing than assets - will benefit net interest income in adeclining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income ina rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positive gap - more assetsrepricing than liabilities - will benefit net interest income if rates arerising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment. -37-  38CONDENSED INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY TABLEAt June 30, 1997, the Corporation had $1,612 million more assets thanliabilities repricing within one year (including net repricing effect ofderivative positions). This compares with $7,945 million more liabilities thanassets repricing within one year, or 2% of total assets, at December 31, 1996.During the first quarter of 1997, management took actions to reduce theCorporation's interest rate sensitivity, and as of June 30, 1997, theCorporation's earnings at risk to an immediate 100 basis point rise in interestrates is estimated to be approximately 1% of the Corporation's projectedafter-tax net income for the next twelve months. An immediate 100 basis pointrise in interest rates is an hypothetical rate scenario, used to measure risk,and does not necessarily represent management's current view of future marketdevelopments. At December 31, 1996, the Corporation's earnings at risk to asimilar increase in market rates was estimated to be approximately 3.5% ofprojected 1997 after-tax net income.Interest Rate Swaps: Interest rate swaps are one of the various financialinstruments used in the Corporation's ALM activities. The following tablesummarizes the outstanding ALM interest rate swap notional amounts at June 30,1997, by twelve-month intervals (i.e., July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998). Thedecrease in notional amounts from one period to the next period representsmaturities of the underlying contracts. The weighted-average fixed interestrates to be received and paid on such swaps are presented for each twelve-monthinterval. The three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), provided forreference in the following table, reflects the average implied forward yieldcurve for that index as of June 30, 1997. However, actual repricings will bebased on the applicable rates in effect at the actual repricing date. To theextent rates change, the variable rates paid or received will change. TheCorporation expects the impact of any interest rate changes on these swaps to belargely mitigated by corresponding changes in the interest rates and valuesassociated with the linked assets and liabilities. -38-  39OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND RECEIVE/PAY RATES BY YEARLYINTERVALSThe following table summarizes the Corporation's assets and liabilities at June30, 1997, with the notional amount of related derivatives used for ALM purposes.(a) At June 30, 1997, notional amounts of approximately $6 billion for interest rate swaps, which are used in place of cash market instruments, have been excluded from the above table. See Note One of the 1996 Annual Report for a discussion of the Corporation's accounting policy relative to derivatives used in place of cash market instruments.(b) Includes futures, forwards, forward rate agreements and options. -39-  40The unfavorable impact on net interest income from the Corporation's ALMderivative activities was $25 million in the second quarter and $49 million forthe first six months of 1997, compared with an unfavorable impact of $46 millionfor the second quarter of 1996 and $35 million for the first six months of 1996.The Corporation also has derivatives that affect noninterest revenue (such asderivatives linked to mortgage servicing rights).The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inthe Corporation's ALM activities at June 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996.The net deferred losses at June 30, 1997 are expected to be amortized as yieldadjustments in net interest income or noninterest revenue, as applicable, overthe periods reflected in the following table. The Corporation also uses selectedderivative financial instruments to manage the sensitivity to changes in marketinterest rates on anticipated transactions; however, such transactions are notsignificant. Accordingly, at June 30, 1997, deferred gains and losses associatedwith such transactions were not material.Included in the table above are gross unrecognized gains and losses from daily margin settlements on open futures contracts which were $3 million and $13 million, respectively, at June 30, 1997. The net unrecognized losses shown above do not include the net favorable impact from the assets/liabilitiesbeing hedged by these derivative contracts. For a further discussion, see Note 12 on page 15.The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes unamortized premiums on open ALM option contracts which will be amortized as a reduction to net interest income or noninterest revenue over the periods indicated in the following table.AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED GAINS (LOSSES) ON CLOSED ALM CONTRACTS AND OFPREMIUMS ON OPEN ALM OPTION CONTRACTSOPERATING RISK MANAGEMENTThe Corporation, like all large financial institutions, is exposed to many typesof operating risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders,unauthorized transactions by employees, and errors relating to computer andtelecommunications systems. The Corporation maintains a system of controls thatis designed to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of thefinancial strength of the Corporation, the characteristics of the businesses andmarkets in which the Corporation operates, competitive circumstances andregulatory considerations. However, from time to time in the past, theCorporation has suffered losses from operating risk and there can be noassurance that the Corporation will not suffer such losses in the future. -40-  41CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 58-59 and NoteSixteen of the Corporation's 1996 Annual Report.CAPITALThe Corporation's level of capital at June 30, 1997 remained strong, withcapital ratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. At June 30, 1997, theCorporation's Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 7.79% and 11.38%,respectively. These ratios, as well as the leverage ratio, exclude the assetsand off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation's securitiessubsidiary, Chase Securities Inc., as well as the Corporation's investment insuch subsidiary. In addition, the provisions of SFAS 115 do not apply to thecalculation of these ratios. The Corporation manages its capital to execute itsstrategic business plans and support its growth and investments, includingacquisition strategies in its core businesses. As part of the Corporation'scommitment to a disciplined capital policy, management has targeted a Tier 1capital ratio for the Corporation of 8 to 8.25%.Total capitalization (the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital) increased by$960 million during the first half of 1997 to $30.3 billion reflecting, inpart, $790 million of capital securities, net of discount, issued by subsidiarytrusts of the Corporation (see Note 7 of this Form 10-Q), partially offset bythe redemption of $670 million of preferred stock.In October 1996, the Corporation announced a common stock purchase program inwhich the Corporation is authorized until December 31, 1998 to purchase up to$2.5 billion of its common stock, in addition to such amount of commonstock as may be necessary to provide for expected issuances under its dividendreinvestment plan and its various stock-based director and employee benefitplans. During the period from the inception of the program through June 30,1997, the Corporation has repurchased 24.3 million common shares ($2.3 billion)and reissued approximately 6.9 million treasury shares ($0.5 billion) under theCorporation's benefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of 17.4 millionshares ($1.8 billion) of its common stock. Management intends to purchase equityon a more accelerated time schedule than originally announced and believes it islikely that the buy-back program will be completed in late 1997 or early 1998.The Corporation raised the cash dividend on its common stock to $.62 per share,an increase from $.56 per share, in the first quarter of 1997. Management'scurrent expectation is that the dividend policy of the Corporation willgenerally be to pay a common stock dividend equal to approximately 25-35% of theCorporation's net income (excluding restructuring charges) less preferred stockdividends. Future dividend policies will be determined by the Board of Directorsin light of the earnings and financial condition of the Corporation and itssubsidiaries and other factors, including applicable governmental regulationsand policies. -41-  42The following table sets forth the components of capital for the Corporation.COMPONENTS OF CAPITAL(a) Minority interest includes Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in Corporation's Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures and in the Preferred Stock of Subsidiary. For a further discussion, see Notes 7 and 8 of this Form 10-Q.(b) Includes off-balance sheet risk-weighted assets in the amount of $88,490 million and $79,099 million, respectively, at June 30, 1997 and December 31, 1996.LIQUIDITYThe primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the Corporationderives from their ability to generate core deposits (which includes alldeposits except noninterest-bearing time deposits, foreign deposits andcertificates of deposit of $100,000 or more). The Corporation considers fundsfrom such sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit base becauseof the historical stability of such sources of funds. These deposits fund aportion of the Corporation's asset base, thereby reducing the Corporation'sreliance on other, more volatile, sources of funds. The Corporation's averagecore deposits for the first six months of 1997 were $80 billion and represented52% of average loans for the period.The Corporation is an active participant in the capital markets. In addition toissuing commercial paper and medium-term notes, the Corporation raises fundsthrough the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and preferred stock. TheCorporation's long-term debt at June 30, 1997 was $13,135 million, an increaseof $421 million from the 1996 year-end. The increase resulted largely fromissuances of the Corporation's long-term debt of $1,481 million, partiallyoffset by maturities of $1,069 million of long-term debt. The Corporation willcontinue to evaluate the opportunity for future redemptions of its outstandingdebt and preferred stock in light of current market conditions. -42-  43SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 2-5 of the Corporation's 1996 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSAt June 30, 1997, in accordance with the dividend restrictions applicable tothem, the Corporation's bank subsidiaries could, during 1997, without theapproval of their relevant banking regulators, pay dividends in an aggregateamount of approximately $2.1 billion to their respective bank holding companies,plus an additional amount equal to their net income from July 1, 1997 throughthe date in 1997 of any such dividend payment.In addition to the dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations,the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") have authority under theFinancial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment ofdividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Corporationand its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in thebanking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe orunsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bankingorganization.FDICIAThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")required the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC depositinsurance. FDICIA also contained provisions limiting certain activities andbusiness methods of depository institutions. Finally, FDICIA provided forexpanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, includingparent holding companies, by such institutions' appropriate Federal bankingregulator. Each of the Corporation's banking institutions were "wellcapitalized" as that term is defined under the various regulations promulgatedunder FDICIA and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect such regulations tohave a material adverse impact on its business operations.ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTSDERIVATIVE AND MARKET RISK DISCLOSURESIn January 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a Release(Nos. 33-7386 and 34-38223) which requires (i) quantitative and qualitativedisclosures outside the financial statements about the market risk inherent inderivatives and other financial instruments and (ii) enhanced descriptions ofaccounting policies for derivatives in the footnotes to the financialstatements.The market risk disclosure requirements of this release will be applicablecommencing with the Corporation's 1997 Annual Report. The Corporation iscurrently evaluating this release and expects to comply with the requirements ofthe release in its 1997 Annual Report.EARNINGS PER SHAREIn February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issuedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 128 entitled, "Earningsper Share" ("SFAS 128"). This statement establishes standards for computing andpresenting earnings per share (EPS) and simplifies the previously issuedaccounting standards for computing earnings per share. It replaces thecomputation and presentation of "primary EPS" with a computation andpresentation of "basic EPS". It revises the computation and presentation of"fully-diluted EPS" with a computation and presentation of "diluted EPS". Italso requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPScomputation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation.SFAS 128 is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending afterDecember 15, 1997.While SFAS 128 is not yet effective, the Corporation believes that with theadoption of SFAS 128, basic EPS would have been approximately $0.05 higher thanprimary EPS for the 1997 second quarter and approximately $0.09 higher for the1997 first six months. The impact of converting from fully-diluted EPS todiluted EPS for the same periods would have been negligible. -43-  44REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEIn June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 130 entitled, "Reporting ComprehensiveIncome" ("SFAS 130"). This statement establishes standards for the reporting anddisplay of comprehensive income which includes, in addition to net income asreported, such items as unrealized holding gains and losses onavailable-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments andcertain other items that are not included in the income statement as presentlyconfigured. SFAS 130 requires that an enterprise classify items of comprehensiveincome in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence asother financial statements. SFAS 130 permits the display of comprehensive incomewithin the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. In addition, SFAS 130requires that an enterprise display the accumulated balance of comprehensiveincome separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in theequity section of the consolidated balance sheet.This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.The Corporation is currently assessing the manner in which it will disclose therequired information. The adoption of SFAS 130 will not affect the Corporation'searnings, liquidity, or capital resources.SEGMENTSIn June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 131 entitled, "Disclosure about Segments ofan Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131"). This statement establishesquantitative and qualitative criteria that an enterprise must use to determinethe number and nature of its operating segments. SFAS 131 requires the reportingof selected information about these operating segments in annual financialstatements and interim financial reports issued to shareholders. It alsoestablishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,geographic areas and major customers.This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.The Corporation is currently assessing the manner in which it will disclose therequired information. The adoption of SFAS 131 will not affect the Corporation'searnings, liquidity, or capital resources.MARKET RISKOn August 29, 1996, the Banking Regulatory Authorities issued an amendment tothe risk-based capital standards to incorporate a measure for market riskconsistent with the principles adopted by the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision under the Basle Capital Accord. The amendment, which is effectiveJanuary 1, 1998 and permits adoption during 1997 with prior regulatory approval,requires banks and bank holding companies that have significant market riskexposure, to measure that risk utilizing a value-at-risk model, based on theparameters contained in the amendment, and to maintain a commensurate amount ofcapital.The Corporation currently expects to adopt the amendment during 1997. Managementanticipates that the adoption will have a modestly favorable impact on theCorporation's reported Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios largely as a result ofthe inclusion of the assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments, andrelated capital, of the Corporation's securities subsidiary, Chase SecuritiesInc., in these ratios. -44-  45 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the three months ended June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.58% and 6.32%, respectively.(c) For the three months ended June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996, the negative impact from nonperforming loans on net interest income was $18 million and $20 million, respectively.(d) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -45-  46 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the six months ended June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.63% and 6.53%, respectively.(c) For the six months ended June 30, 1997 and June 30, 1996, the negative impact from nonperforming loans on net interest income was $35 million and $49 million, respectively.(d) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -46-  47 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) -47-  48PART II - OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.
