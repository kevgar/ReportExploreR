The U.S.economy improved significantly, supportedby diminishing geopolitical uncertainties,new tax relief, strong profit growth, lowinterest rates and a rising stock market.Productivity at U.S. businesses continuedto grow at an extraordinary pace, as aresult of ongoing investment ininformation technologies. Profit marginsrose to levels not seen in a long time.New hiring remained tepid, but signs of animproving job market emerged late in theyear. Inflation fell to the lowest levelin more than 40&nbsp;years, and the Board ofGovernors of the Federal Reserve System(the &#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;) declaredthat its long-run goal of price stabilityhad been achieved.Against this backdrop, J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;)reported 2003 Net income of $6.7&nbsp;billion,compared with Net income of $1.7&nbsp;billionin 2002. All five of the Firm's linesof business benefited from the improvedeconomic conditions, with each reportingincreased revenue over 2002. Inparticular, the low&#150;interest rateenvironment drove robust fixed incomemarkets and an unprecedented mortgagerefinancing boom, resulting in recordearnings in the Investment Bank and ChaseFinancial Services.Total revenue for 2003 was $33.3billion, up 12% from 2002. TheInvestment Bank's revenue increased byapproximately $1.9&nbsp;billion from 2002,and Chase Financial Services' revenuewas $14.6&nbsp;billion in 2003, anotherrecord year.Total Noninterest expense was $21.7billion, down 5% from the prior year. In2002, the Firm recorded $1.3&nbsp;billion ofcharges, principally for Enron-relatedsurety litigation and the establishment oflitigation reserves; and $1.2&nbsp;billion forMerger and restructuring costs related toprograms announced prior to January&nbsp;1,2002. Excluding these costs, expenses roseby 7% in 2003, reflecting higherperformance-related incentives; increasedcosts related to stock-based compensationand pension and other postretirementexpenses; and higher occupancy expenses. The Firm began expensingstock options in 2003. Restructuring costsassociated with initiatives announcedafter January&nbsp;1, 2002, were recorded intheir relevant expense categories andtotaled $630&nbsp;million in 2003, down 29%from 2002.The 2003 Provision for credit losses of$1.5&nbsp;billion was down $2.8&nbsp;billion, or64%, from 2002. The provision was lowerthan total net charge-offs of $2.3billion, reflecting significantimprovement in the quality of thecommercial loan portfolio. Commercialnonperforming assets and criticizedexposure levels declined 42% and 47%,respectively, from December&nbsp;31, 2002.Consumer credit quality remained stable.Earnings per diluted share (&#147;EPS&#148;) forthe year were $3.24, an increase of 305%over the EPS of $0.80 reported in 2002.Results in 2002 were provided on both areported basis and an operating basis,which excluded Merger and restructuringcosts and special items.

Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report22 Table of ContentsSegment results &#150; Operating basis (a)The table above shows JPMorgan Chase'ssegment results. These results reflect themanner in which the Firm's financialinformation is currently evaluated bymanagement and is presented on anoperating basis. Prior-period segmentresults have been adjusted to reflectalignment of management accountingpolicies or changes in organizationalstructure among businesses.IB reported record earnings of $3.7billion for 2003, up 183% from 2002,driven by strong growth in capital marketsrevenues and equity underwriting fees,coupled with a significant decline incredit costs. The low&#150;interest-rateenvironment, improvement in equity marketsand volatility in credit markets producedincreased client and portfolio managementrevenue in fixed income and equities, aswell as strong returns in Global Treasury.Market-share gains in equity underwritingcontributed to the increase in Investmentbanking fees over 2002. IB's return onallocated capital was 19% for the year.TSS earnings of $520&nbsp;million for the yearwere down 16% compared with 2002. Revenueswere $4.0&nbsp;billion for the full year, up 3%from 2002. Institutional Trust Servicesand Treasury Services posted single-digitrevenue growth. Investor Services revenuedeclined year-over-year but showed animproving trend over the last fourconsecutive quarters. Return on allocatedcapital for TSS was 19% for the year.IMPB increased earnings and assets undersupervision in 2003. Earnings of $268million for the full year were up 3% from2002, reflecting an improved creditportfolio, slightly higher revenues andthe benefits of managed expense growth.The increase in revenues reflected theacquisition of Retirement Plan Services,and increased average equity marketvaluations in client portfolios andbrokerage activity, mostly offset by theimpact of institutional net outflows.Investment performance in coreinstitutional products improved, with allmajor asset classes in U.S. institutionalfixed income and equities showingabove-benchmark results. Return onallocated capital was 5% for the year;return on tangible allocated capital was20%.JPMP performance improved significantly,with private equity gains of $27million, compared with private equitylosses of $733&nbsp;million for 2002. Resultsfor the direct investments portfolioimproved by $929&nbsp;million from 2002,driven by realized gains on sales anddeclining write-downs in the second half of 2003.JPMP revenuewas impactedin 2003 by losses on sales and writedownsof private third-party fundinvestments. JPMP decreased its operatingloss for the year by 64% compared with2002.CFS posted record earnings of $2.5billion, driven by record results andorigination volumes at each of thenational credit businesses &#150;mortgage,credit card and auto. Record revenues forCFS of $14.6&nbsp;billion were up 9% from 2002,driven by record revenues in Chase HomeFinance. Despite significant depositgrowth, Chase Regional Banking revenuesdecreased due to deposit spreadcompression. CFS's return on allocatedcapital was 28% for the year.In 2003, JPMorgan Chase revised itsinternal management reporting policies toallocate certain revenues, expenses andtax-related items that had been recordedwithin the Corporate segment to the otherbusiness segments. There was no impact onthe Firm's overall earnings.For a discussion of the Firm's Segmentresults, see pages 27&#150;44 of this AnnualReport.Capital and liquidity managementJPMorgan Chase increased capital during2003. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Firm'sTier 1 capital was $43.2&nbsp;billion, $5.6billion higher than at December&nbsp;31, 2002.The Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% was wellin excess of the minimum regulatoryguidelines, it was 8.2% at year-end 2002.The Firm maintained the quarterly dividendof $0.34 per share on its common stock.JPMorgan Chase did not repurchase sharesof its common stock in 2003. Managementexpects to recommend to the Board ofDirectors that the Firm resume its sharerepurchase program after the completion ofthe pending merger with Bank OneCorporation (see Business events below).The Firm's liquidity management isdesigned to ensure sufficient liquidityresources to meet all its obligations,both on- and off&#150;balance sheet, in a widerange of market environments. The Firm'saccess to the unsecured funding marketsis dependent upon its credit rating.During 2003, the Firm maintained seniordebt ratings of AA-/Aa3/A&#043; at JPMorganChase Bank and A&#043;/A1/A&#043; at the parentholding company. Upon the announcement ofthe proposed merger with Bank OneCorporation, Moody's and Fitch placed theFirm's ratings on review for anJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report23 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.upgrade, and S&P affirmed all of theFirm's ratings. See Business eventsbelow.Risk managementThe Firm made substantial progress inlowering its risk profile in 2003.Total commercial credit exposure, whichincludes loans, derivative receivables,lending-related commitments and otherassets, declined by $30.2&nbsp;billion, or 7%,from December&nbsp;31, 2002. Increasedfinancings in the public markets, reducedloan demand and loan sales drove thedecline. In 2003, the Firm implemented amore stringent exposure-review process andlower absolute exposure limits forindustry and single-name concentrations,including investment-grade obligors. TheFirm was also more active in managingcommercial credit by selling higher-riskloans and commitments and entering intosingle-name credit default swap hedges.Total consumer loans on a managed basis,which includes both reported andsecuritized loans, increased by $15.7billion, or 10%, from December&nbsp;31, 2002.The consumer portfolio is predominantlyU.S.-based. The largest component, 1&#150;4family residential mortgage loans, whichare primarily secured by first mortgages,comprised 43% of the total consumerportfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2003.JPMP's private equity portfolio declinedby 12% to $7.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2003, from $8.2&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2002. At year-end 2003, the portfolio wasdiversified across industry sectors andgeographies &#150; with a higher percentageinvested in more mature leveraged buyoutsand a lower percentage in ventureinvestments than at year-end 2002. Thecarrying value of JPMP's portfolio hasdecreased year-over-year, consistent withmanagement's goal to reduce, over time,the capital committed to private equity.The Firm uses several tools, bothstatistical and nonstatistical, to measuremarket risk, including Value-at-Risk(&#147;VAR&#148;), Risk identification for largeexposures (&#147;RIFLE&#148;), economic value stresstests and net interest income stresstests. The Firm calculates VAR daily onits trading and nontrading activities.Average trading VAR decreased forfull-year 2003. The year-end trading VARincreased compared with year-end 2002 dueto higher VAR for equity activities. In2003, trading losses exceeded VAR on onlyone day, a result that is consistent withthe 99% confidence level.Average, maximum, and December&nbsp;31nontrading VAR increased in 2003,primarily due to the increase in marketvolatility during the 2003 third quarterand to the rise in interest rates in thesecond half of 2003. There was anadditional day in 2003 in which lossesexceeded VAR; this was attributable tocertain positions in the mortgage bankingbusiness.The Firm is also committed to maintainingbusiness practices of the highest quality.The Fiduciary Risk Committee isresponsible for overseeing that businessesproviding investment or risk managementproducts and services perform at theappropriate standard in theirrelationships with clients. In addition,the Policy Review Office oversees thereview of transactions with clients interms of appropriateness, ethical issuesand reputation risk, withthe goal that these transactions arenot used to mislead investors orothers.During the year, the Firm revised itscapital allocation methodologies forcredit, operational, business and privateequity risk. This resulted in thereallocation of capital among the riskcategories and the business segments; thereallocation did not result in asignificant change in the amount of totalcapital allocated to the business segmentsas a whole.For a further discussion of Riskmanagement and the capital allocationmethodology, see pages 45-74 of thisAnnual Report.Business outlookGlobal economic conditions and financialmarkets activity are expected to continueto improve in 2004. While rising interestrates may negatively affect the mortgageand Global Treasury businesses; on thepositive side, gains in market share,rising equity values and increased marketactivity may benefit many of the Firm'sother businesses.The Firm expects to see a different mix ofearnings in 2004. IB is targeting higherissuer and investor client revenue, butsecurities gains and net interest incomemay be lower. Mortgage earnings are likelyto decline from the record set in 2003,and growth in other retail businesses maynot be sufficient to offset the decline inmortgage revenue. Improved equity marketsand increased M&A activity may provideincreased exit opportunities in privateequity and could result in higher fees inIMPB and in the custody business of TSS.Commercial net charge-off ratios may belower, but credit costs may rise as thereduction in the Allowance for creditlosses slows. The Firm expects stableconsumer net charge-off ratios in 2004.Business eventsAgreement to merge with Bank One CorporationOn January&nbsp;14, 2004, JPMorgan Chase andBank One Corporation (&#147;Bank One&#148;)announced an agreement to merge. Themerger agreement, which has been approvedby the boards of directors of bothcompanies, provides for a stock-for-stockmerger in which 1.32 shares of JPMorganChase common stock will be exchanged, on atax-free basis, for each share of Bank Onecommon stock.The merged company, headquartered in NewYork, will be known as J.P.

It is expected that costsavings of $2.2&nbsp;billion (pre-tax) will beachieved over a three-year period.Merger-related costs are expected to be $3billion (pre-tax).The merger is subject to approval by theshareholders of both institutions as wellas U.S. federal and state and non-U.S.regulatory authorities. It is expected tobe completed in mid-2004.For further information concerning themerger, see Note 2 on page 87 of thisAnnual Report.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report24 Table of ContentsResults of operationsThis section discusses JPMorgan Chase'sresults of operations on a reported basis.The accompanying financial data conformswith accounting principles generallyaccepted in the United States of America(&#147;GAAP&#148;) and prevailing industrypractices. The section should be read inconjunction with the Consolidatedfinancial statements and Notes toconsolidated financial statementsbeginning on page 82 of this AnnualReport.RevenuesInvestment banking feesInvestment banking fees of $2.9&nbsp;billionrose 5% from 2002. For a discussion ofInvestment banking fees, which areprimarily recorded in IB, see IB segmentresults on pages 29&#150;31 of this AnnualReport.Trading revenueTrading revenue in 2003 of $4.4&nbsp;billionwas up 65% from the prior year. Fixedincome and equity capital marketsactivities drove growth in both client andportfolio management revenues. Portfoliomanagement, in particular, was upsignificantly from 2002 as a result ofgains in credit, foreign exchange andequity derivatives activities. Tradingrevenue, on a reported basis, excludes theimpact of Net interest income (&#147;NII&#148;)related to IB's trading activities, whichis reported in NII. However, the Firmincludes trading-related NII as part ofTrading revenue for segment reportingpurposes to better assess theprofitability of IB's trading business.For additional information on Tradingrevenue, see IB segment discussion onpages 29&#150;31 of this Annual Report.Fees and commissionsFees and commissions of $10.7&nbsp;billion in2003 rose 3% from the prior year as aresult of higher credit card servicingfees associated with $5.8&nbsp;billion ingrowth in average securitized credit cardreceivables. Also contributing to theincrease from 2002 were higher custody,institutional trust and otherprocessing-related service fees. Thesefees reflected the more favorableenvironment for debt and equityactivities. For a tableshowing the components of Fees andcommissions, see Note 4 on pages 88&#150;89of this Annual Report.For additional information on Fees andcommissions, see the segment discussionsof TSS for Custody and institutional trustservice fees, IMPB for Investmentmanagement and service fees, and CFS forconsumer-related fees on pages 32&#150;33,34&#150;35 and 38&#150;43, respectively, of thisAnnual Report.Private equity gains (losses)Private equity gains of $33&nbsp;million in2003 reflect significant improvement fromlosses of $746&nbsp;million in 2002. For adiscussion of Private equity gains(losses), which are primarily recorded inJPMP, see JPMP results on pages 36&#150;37.Securities gainsIn 2003, Securities gains of $1.4&nbsp;billiondeclined 7% from the prior year. Thedecline reflected lower gains realizedfrom the sale of government and agencysecurities in IB and mortgage-backedsecurities in Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;),driven by the increasing interest rateenvironment beginning in the third quarterof 2003. IB uses available-for-saleinvestment securities to manage, in part,the asset/liability exposures of the Firm;CHF uses these instruments to economicallyhedge the value of mortgage servicingrights (&#147;MSRs&#148;). For a further analysis ofsecurities gains, see IB and CHF on pages29&#150;31 and 39&#150;40, respectively, of thisAnnual Report.Mortgage fees and related incomeMortgage fees and related income of $892million in 2003 declined 10% from 2002.The decline reflects lower mortgageservicing fees and lower revenues from MSRhedging activities; these were offset byhigher fees from origination and salesactivity and other fees derived fromvolume and market-share growth. Mortgagefees and related income, on a reportedbasis, excludes the impact of NII andsecurities gains and losses related toChase Home Finance's mortgage bankingactivities. For a further discussion ofmortgage-related revenue, see the segmentdiscussion for Chase Home Finance on pages39&#150;40 and Note 4 on page 89 of this AnnualReport.Other revenueOther revenue of $579&nbsp;million in 2003 rose26% from the prior year. The increase wasa result of $200&nbsp;million in gains from thesale of securities acquired in loansatisfactions (compared with $26&nbsp;millionin 2002), partly offset by lower netresults from corporate and bank-owned lifeinsurance policies. Many other factorscontributed to the change from 2002,including $73&nbsp;million of write-downs takenin 2002 for several Latin Americaninvestments.Net interest incomeNII of $12.3&nbsp;billion was 7% higher thanin 2002. The increase reflected thepositive impact of lower interest rateson consumer loan originations andrelated funding costs. Average mortgageloans in CHF rose 32% to $74.1&nbsp;billion, andaverage automobile loans and leases in Chase Auto Financeincreased 32% toJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report25 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.$41.7 billion. NII wasreduced by a lower volume of commercialloans and lower spreads on investmentsecurities. As a component of NII,trading-related net interest income of$2.1&nbsp;billion was up 13% from 2002 due to achange in the composition of, and growthin, trading assets.The Firm's total average interest-earningassets in 2003 were $590&nbsp;billion, up 6%from the prior year. The net interestyield on these assets, on a fullytaxable-equivalent basis, was 2.10%,compared with 2.09% in the prior year.Noninterest expenseCompensation expenseCompensation expense in 2003 was 6% higherthan in the prior year. The increaseprincipally reflected higherperformance-related incentives, and higherpension and other postretirement benefitcosts, primarily as aresult of changes in actuarialassumptions. For a detailed discussion ofpension and other postretirement benefitcosts, see Note 6 on pages 89&#150;93 of thisAnnual Report. The increase pertaining toincentives included $266&nbsp;million as aresult of adopting SFAS 123, and $120million from the reversal in 2002 ofpreviously accrued expenses for certainforfeitable key employee stock awards, asdiscussed in Note 7 on pages 93&#150;95 of thisAnnual Report. Total compensation expensedeclined as a result of the transfer,beginning April&nbsp;1, 2003, of 2,800employees to IBM in connection with atechnology outsourcing agreement. The total number of full-timeequivalent employees at December 31, 2003 was 93,453 compared with94,335 at the prior year-end.Occupancy expenseOccupancy expense of $1.9&nbsp;billion rose 19%from 2002. The increase reflected costs ofadditional leased space in midtownManhattan and in the South and Southwestregions of the United States; higher realestate taxes in New York City; and thecost of enhanced safety measures. Alsocontributing to the increase were chargesfor unoccupied excess real estate of $270million; this compared with $120&nbsp;millionin 2002, mostly in the third quarter ofthat year.Technology and communications expenseIn 2003, Technology and communicationsexpense was 11% above the prior-yearlevel. The increase was primarily due to ashift in expenses: costs that werepreviously associated with Compensationand Other expenses shifted, upon thecommencement of the IBM outsourcingagreement, to Technology andcommunications expense. Also contributingto the increase were higher costs relatedto software amortization. For a furtherdiscussion of the IBM outsourcingagreement, see Support Units and Corporateon page 44 of this Annual Report.Other expenseOther expense in 2003 rose slightly fromthe prior year, reflecting higher Outsideservices. For a table showing thecomponents of Other expense, see Note 8on page 96 of this Annual Report.Surety settlement and litigation reserveThe Firm added $100&nbsp;million to theEnron-related litigation reserve in 2003to supplement a $900&nbsp;million reserveinitially recorded in 2002. The 2002reserve was established to coverEnron-related matters, as well as certainother material litigation, proceedings andinvestigations in which the Firm isinvolved. In addition, in 2002 the Firmrecorded a charge of $400&nbsp;million for thesettlement of Enron-related suretylitigation.Merger and restructuring costsMerger and restructuring costs related tobusiness restructurings announced afterJanuary&nbsp;1, 2002, were recorded in theirrelevant expense categories. In 2002,Merger and restructuring costs of $1.2billion, for programs announced prior toJanuary&nbsp;1, 2002, were viewed bymanagement as nonoperating expenses or&#147;special items.&#148; Refer to Note 8 on pages 95&#150;96 of thisAnnual Report for a further discussion ofMerger and restructuring costs and for asummary, by expense category and businesssegment, of costs incurred in 2003 and2002 for programs announced after January1, 2002.Provision for credit lossesThe 2003 Provision for credit losses was$2.8&nbsp;billion lower than in 2002, primarilyreflecting continued improvement in thequality of the commercial loan portfolioand a higher volume of credit cardsecuritizations. For further informationabout the Provision for credit losses andthe Firm's management of credit risk, seethe discussions of net charge-offsassociated with the commercial andconsumer loan portfolios and the Allowancefor credit losses, on pages 63&#150;65 of this Annual Report.Income tax expenseIncome tax expense was $3.3&nbsp;billion in2003, compared with $856&nbsp;million in 2002.The effective tax rate in 2003 was 33%,compared with 34% in 2002. The tax ratedecline was principally attributable tochanges in the proportion of incomesubject to state and local taxes.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report26 Table of ContentsSegment resultsJPMorgan Chase's lines of business aresegmented based on the products andservices provided or the type of customerserviced and reflect the manner in whichfinancial information is currentlyevaluated by the Firm's management.Revenues and expenses directly associatedwith each segment are included indetermining that segment's results.Management accounting and other policiesexist to allocate those remaining expensesthat are not directly incurred by thesegments.OverviewThe wholesale businesses of JPMorgan Chaseare known globally as &#147;JPMorgan&#148; andcomprise the Investment Bank, Treasury &Securities Services, Investment Management& Private Banking and JPMorgan Partners.The national consumer and middle marketbusinesses are known as &#147;Chase&#148; andcollectively comprise Chase FinancialServices.Basis of presentationThe Firm prepares its consolidatedfinancial statements, which appear onpages 82&#150;85 of this Annual Report, usingU.S. GAAP and prevailing industrypractices. The financial statements arepresented on a &#147;reported basis,&#148; whichprovides the reader with an understandingof the Firm's results that can beconsistently tracked from year to year andenables a comparison of the Firm'sperformance with other companies' U.S.GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm'sresults on a reported basis, managementlooks at results on an &#147;operating basis,&#148;which is a non-GAAP financial measure, toassess each of its lines of business andto measure overall Firm results againsttargeted goals. The definition ofoperating basis starts with the reportedU.S. GAAP results and then excludes theimpact of credit card securitizations.Securitization does not change JPMorganChase's reported versus operating netincome; however, it does affect theclassification of items in theConsolidated statement of income. For afurther discussion of credit cardsecuritizations, see Chase CardmemberServices on page 41 of this Annual Report.Prior to 2003, the Firm excluded from itsoperating results the impact of merger andrestructuring costs and special items, asthese transactions were viewed bymanagement as not part of the Firm'snormal daily business operations orunusual in nature and, therefore, notindicative of trends. To be considered aspecial item, the nonrecurring gain orloss had to be at least $75&nbsp;million ormore during 2002. Commencing in 2003,management determined that many of thecosts previously considered nonoperatingwere to be deemed operating costs.However, it is possible that in thefuture, management may designate certainmaterial gains or losses incurred by theFirm to be &#147;special items.&#148;The segment results also reflectrevenue- and expense-sharing agreementsbetween certain lines of business.Revenue and expenses attributed toshared activities are recognized in eachline of business, and any doublecounting is eliminated at the segmentlevel. These arrangements promotecross-selling and management of sharedclient expenses. They also ensure thatthe contributionsof both businesses are fully recognized.Prior-period segment results have beenadjusted to reflect alignment ofmanagement accounting policies or changesin organizational structure amongbusinesses. Restatements of segmentresults may occur in the future.See Note 34 on pages 126-127 of thisAnnual Report for further informationabout JPMorgan Chase's five businesssegments.Capital allocationThe Firm allocates capital to its businessunits utilizing a risk-adjustedmethodology, which quantifies credit,market, operational and business riskswithin each business and additionally, forJPMP, private equity risk. For adiscussion of those risks, see the riskmanagement sections on pages 45&#150;74 of thisAnnual Report. The Firm allocatesadditional capital to its businessesincorporating an &#147;asset capital tax&#148; onmanaged assets and some off&#150;balance sheetinstruments. In addition, businesses areallocated capital equal to 100% ofgoodwill and 50% for certainJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report27 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P.

The Firm estimates theportfolio effect on required economiccapital based on correlations of riskacross risk categories. This estimateddiversification benefit is not allocatedto the business segments.Performance measurementThe Firm uses the shareholder value added(&#147;SVA&#148;) framework to measure theperformance of its business segments. Toderive SVA, a non-GAAP financial measure,for its business segments, the Firmapplies a 12% (after-tax) cost of capitalto each segment, except JPMP &#150; thisbusiness is charged a 15% (after-tax) costof capital. The capital elements andresultant capital charges provide eachbusiness with the financial framework toevaluate the trade-off between usingcapital versus its return to sharehold-ers. Capital charges are an integral partof the SVA measurement for each business.Under the Firm's model, economic capitalis either underallocated or overallocatedto the business segments, as compared withthe Firm's total common stockholders'equity. The revenue and SVA impact of this over/underallocation is reported under Support Unitsand Corporate. See Glossary of terms onpage 131 of this Annual Report for adefinition of SVA and page 44 of thisAnnual Report for more details.JPMorgan Chase's lines of businessutilize individual performance metricsunique to the respective businesses tomeasure their results versus those oftheir peers.

The InvestmentBank also commits the Firm's own capitalto proprietary investing and tradingactivities.Financial results overviewThe 2003 performance of IB was positivelyinfluenced by a low interest-rateenvironment, a more favorable equitiesmarket and an improving credit market,partially offset by continued weakness inM&A activity.In 2003, IB reported record operatingearnings of $3.7&nbsp;billion, an increase of183% compared with 2002. Revenue growth of16% far outpaced expense growth of 6%.Credit costs were negative $181&nbsp;million in2003, compared with $2.4&nbsp;billion in 2002.Return on allocated capital for the year was19%.Operating revenue of $14.4&nbsp;billionconsisted of investment banking fees foradvisory and underwriting services; capitalmarkets revenue related to market-making,trading and investing; and revenue fromcorporate lending activities.Investment banking fees of $2.9&nbsp;billionwere up 6%. While Advisory fees declined by14%, reflecting depressed levels of M&Aactivity, debt underwriting fees were up2%. This 2% increase is primarily due togrowth in high yield underwriting andstructured finance fees and reflects apartial offset of lower loan syndicationfees.

Creditportfolio revenue of $1.4&nbsp;billion was down6% the result of tightening of creditspreads in the second quarter of 2003, aswell as lower NII, which reflected lowerlevels of commercial loans. Equitiesrevenue of $1.5&nbsp;billion was up 51% fromlast year due to higher client activityand portfolio management results inderivatives and convertibles.Operating expense increased 6% from 2002,reflecting higher incentives related toimproved financial performance and theimpact of expensing stock options.Noncompensation costs were up 4% from theprior year due to increases in technologyand occupancy costs. Severance and relatedcosts of $347&nbsp;million were down 41%. Theoverhead ratio for 2003 was 59%, comparedwith 64% in 2002.Credit costs were negative $181&nbsp;million,$2.6&nbsp;billion lower than in the prior year,reflecting improvement in the overallcredit quality of the commercial portfolioand the restructuring of severalnonperforming commercial loans.Corporate credit allocationIn 2003, IB assigned to TSS pre-taxearnings and allocated capital associatedwith clients shared with TSS.

Growth inclient-related revenue may be offset bypotentially lower securities gains and NII. NII may be lowerdue to decreased spreads on investmentsecurities and lower loan volumes.

Increasedoperating expense of 7% and a lowercorporate credit allocation contributed tothe lower earnings.Operating revenue increased by 3%, withgrowth at Institutional Trust Services(&#147;ITS&#148;) of 7%. ITS revenue growth camefrom debtproduct lines, increased volume in assetservicing and the result of acquisitionswhich generated $29&nbsp;million of new revenuein 2003. Treasury Services' revenue rose6% on higher trade and commercial paymentcard revenue and increased balance-relatedearnings, including higher balancedeficiency fees resulting from the lowerinterest rate environment.

Global economicconditions rebounded in 2003, as corporateearnings improved and the creditenvironment strengthened. During 2003,global equity markets rose (as exemplifiedby the S&P 500 index, which rose by 26%,and the MSCI World index, which rose by31%), and investor activity levels increased across IMPB's retail and privatebank client bases,particularly during the second half of theyear. This global equity market recovery,on a year-over-year basis, brought 2003'saverage annual market levels broadly backin line with 2002's average. Investmentperformance in core institutional productsimproved with all major asset classes,with U.S. institutional fixed income andequities markets showing above-benchmarkresults.IMPB's operating earnings were 3% higherthan in the prior year, reflecting animproved credit portfolio, the benefits ofslightly higher revenues and managedexpense growth. Quarterly earningsincreased sequentially during the year.During the second quarter of 2003, theFirm acquired American Century RetirementPlan Services Inc., a provider of definedcontribution recordkeeping services, aspart of its strategy to grow its U.S.retail investment management business. Thebusiness was renamed JPMorgan RetirementPlan Services (&#147;RPS&#148;). Return on tangibleallocated capital was 20%.Operating revenue of $2.9&nbsp;billion was 1%higher than in the prior year. Theincrease was driven by higher Fees andcommissions and Net interest income. Thegrowth in Fees and commissions reflectedthe acquisition of RPS and increasedaverage equity market valuations in clientportfolios, partly offset by institutionalnet outflows. The growth in Net interestincome reflected higher brokerage accountbalances and spreads. The decline in allother revenue primarily reflectednonrecurring items in 2002.Operating expense increased by 3%,reflecting the acquisition of RPS, highercompensation expense, and real estate andsoftware write-offs, partly offset by thecontinued impact of expense managementprograms.The 59% decrease in credit costsreflected the improvement in the qualityof the credit portfolio and recoveries.J.P.

In response to the continuinglow&#150;interest rate environment andcompetition in the marketplace, in 2003,CFS focused its efforts on growing ormaintaining market share in its variousbusinesses, enhancing its online bankingcapabilities,disciplined expense management andmaintaining the credit quality of its loanportfolios. As a result ofthese efforts, 2003 CFS operatingearnings were a record $2.5&nbsp;billion, anincrease of 8% from 2002. Return onallocated capital was 28%, up from 27% in2002. Shareholder value added increasedby 12%.Operating revenue was $14.6&nbsp;billion in2003, an increase of 9% over 2002. Netinterest income increased 17% to $9.6billion, reflecting the positive impact ofthe lower interest rate environment onconsumer loan originations, particularlyin Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;), and lowerfunding costs. The increase was partlyoffset by reduced spreads on deposits. CHFrevenue increased by 38% over the prioryear, driven by strong operating revenue(which excludes MSR hedging revenue) and,to a lesser extent, higher MSR hedgingrevenue. Chase Cardmember Services (&#147;CCS&#148;)revenue increased by 4%, the result oflower funding costs, growth in averagereceivables and higher interchange feesearned on customer purchases. Chase AutoFinance (&#147;CAF&#148;) revenue grew 23%, drivenby record originations of almost $28billion and lower funding costs. ChaseRegional Banking (&#147;CRB&#148;) and Chase MiddleMarket (&#147;CMM&#148;) revenues decreased 9% and1%, respectively, as a result of lowerdeposit spreads from lower interest rates,partly offset by the effect ofsignificantly higher deposit volumescompared with 2002.Operating expense rose 10% to $7.3billion. The increase in expense reflectshigher business volume and highercompensation costs. Partially offsettinghigher expenses were savings achievedthrough Six Sigma and other productivityefforts. The overhead ratio increasedslightly compared with a year ago.Credit costs on a managed basis (whichincludes securitized credit cards) of $3.4billion increased by 9% compared with theprior year. While credit quality remainedstable in 2003, net charge-offs increasedby 2%. The increase in 2003 netcharge-offs was driven by a 19% increasein average managed loans.

In CAF, online applicationprocessing reached 95% dealer penetration,while consumer adoption of Chase's onlineautomobile offerings continued to grow.Business outlookIn 2004, CFS anticipates operating revenueand earnings will be lower, primarily dueto a decrease in production revenue inCHF, as refinancing activity declines fromthe record levels set in 2003. While CFSexpects the other retail businesses toreport modest revenue growth and improvedefficiencies, this growth may not offsetthe lower mortgage earnings.Chase Financial Services' business results&nbsp;Chase Home FinanceThe following table sets forth key revenuecomponents of CHF's business.CHF is the fourth largest mortgageoriginator and servicer in the UnitedStates, with more than four millioncustomers. CHF conducts business in all 50states and has approximately 17,000employees in more than 300 locationsnationwide. CHF offers an extensive arrayof residential mortgage products deliveredacross a variety of distribution channelsand customer touch points. CHF comprisesthree key businesses: Production,Servicing andPortfolio Lending. The Production businessoriginates and sells mortgages. TheServicing business manages accounts forCHF's four million customers. ThePortfolio Lending business holds forinvestment adjustable-rate first mortgageloans, home equity and manufacturedhousing loans originated and purchasedthrough the Production channels. Thesethree segments provide CHF with balance toenable it to benefit across varyingbusiness cycles. The Production segment ismost profitable when mortgage rates aredeclining and origination volume is high.Alternatively, the Servicing businesscollects more fees when rates are risingand mortgage prepayments are low.Portfolio Lending provides increasing NII,with growth in home equity andadjustable-rate first mortgage lending.The counter-cyclical(Production/Servicing) and complementary(Portfolio Lending) nature of thesebusinesses, in combination with financialrisk management, enabled CHF to producerecord earnings.The residential mortgage market had arecord year in 2003, with an estimated$3.8 trillion in industry-wideorigination volume. The strong market wasdriven by historically low interestrates, higher consumer confidence,improved housing affordability andexceptionally strong new and existinghome sales. CHF capitalized on thisenvironment, achieving record levels ofJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report39 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.loan originations and applications. CHF'sproduction market share grew from 5.8% in2002 to 7.6% in 2003, primarily due tosuccessful expansion in first mortgage andhome equity lending through growth instrategic, higher-margin distributionchannels such as retail, wholesale,telephone-based and e-commerce.Origination volume totaled a record $284billion, an increase of 82% from 2002.Home Equity volume, a strategic growtharea, increased by 71% from the prioryear. In addition, despite record levelsof loan prepayments in 2003, loansserviced increased by 10% from year-end2002 to $470&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003.CHF manages and measures its results fromtwo key perspectives: its operatingbusinesses (Production/Servicing andPortfolio Lending) and revenue generatedthrough managing the interest rate riskassociated with MSRs. The table belowreconciles management's perspective onCHF's business results to the reportedGAAP line items shown on the Consolidatedstatement of income and in the relatedNotes to consolidated financialstatements. While the operating andhedging activities are interrelated, theMSR hedging function is a risk managementactivity subject to significant volatilityas market interest rates and yield curvesfluctuate. As a result, operating businessresults are reported separately fromhedging results to gain a betterperspective on each activity.CHF achieved record financial performancein 2003, as total revenue of $4.0&nbsp;billionincreased by 38% from 2002. Recordoperating earnings of $1.3&nbsp;billionincreased by 48% from 2002.CHF'soperating revenue (excluding MSR hedging revenue) of $3.8&nbsp;billionincreased by 38% over 2002. The strongperformance was due to record productionrevenue resulting from market-sharegrowth, record margins and higher homeequity revenue. Management expects adecrease in revenue in 2004, as productionmargins are expected to decline due tolower origination volumes and increasedprice competition.In its hedging activities, CHF uses acombination of derivatives and AFSsecurities to manage changes in themarket value of MSRs. The intent is tooffset any changes in the market value ofMSRs with changes in the market value ofthe related risk management instrument.During 2003, negative MSR valuationadjustments of $785&nbsp;million were morethan offset by $1.0&nbsp;billion of aggregatederivative gains, realized gains on salesof AFS securities and net interest earnedon AFS securities. Unrealizedgains/(losses) on AFS Securities were$(144) million at December&nbsp;31, 2003, and$377&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2002. For afurther discussion of MSRs, see CriticalAccounting Estimates on page 77 and Note16 on pages 107&#150;109 of this Annual Report.Operating expense of $1.7&nbsp;billionincreased by 28% from 2002 as a result ofgrowth in origination volume as well as ahigher level of mortgage servicing.Substantial portions of CHF's expenses arevariable in nature and, accordingly,fluctuate with the overall level oforigination and servicing activity. Inaddition to increases brought on by higherbusiness volumes, expenses increased dueto higher performance-related incentives,as well as strategic investments made tofurther expand into higher-margin businesssectors, along with production-relatedrestructuring efforts initiated in thefourth quarter of 2003. These increaseswere partially offset by continued gainsin productivity and benefits realized fromSix Sigma initiatives during 2003.Credit costs of $240&nbsp;million for 2003increased by 26% from 2002 due to ahigher provision for credit losses,primarily the result of higher loanbalances. Credit quality continued to bestrong relative to 2002, as evidenced bya lower net charge-off ratio and 30&#043; daydelinquency rate.Business-related metricsJ.P.

In addition, CCSis the largest U.S. merchant acquirer (anentity that contracts with merchants tofacilitate the acceptance of transactioncards), with annual sales volume in excessof $260&nbsp;billion, through a joint venturewith First Data Merchant Services.CCS's operating results exclude the impactof credit card securitizations. CCSperiodically securitizes a portion of itscredit card portfolio by transferring apool of credit card receivables to atrust, which sells securities toinvestors. CCS receives fee revenue forcontinuing to service those receivablesand additional revenue from any interestand fees on the receivables in excess ofthe interest paid to investors, net ofcredit losses and servicing fees. CCSreports credit costs on a managed oroperating basis. Credit costson an operating basis are composed of theProvision for credit losses in theConsolidated statement of income (whichincludes a provision for credit cardreceivables in the Consolidated balancesheet) as well as the credit costsassociated with securitized credit cardloans. As the holder of the residualinterest in the securitization trust, CCSbears its share of the credit costs forsecuritized loans. In JPMorgan Chase'sConsolidated financial statements, creditcosts associated with securitized creditcard loans reduce the noninterest incomeremitted to the Firm from thesecuritization trust. This income isreported in Credit card fees, in Feesand commissions, over the life of thesecuritization.Securitization does not change CCS'sreported versus operating net income;however, it does affect the classificationof items on the Consolidated statement ofincome. The abbreviated financial information presented below is prepared on a managedbasis and includes the effect ofsecuritizations.&nbsp;Operating earnings increased by 3% over2002 to $679&nbsp;million, driven by higherrevenue, partially offset by higher creditcosts and expenses. The operatingenvironment reflected continuedcompetitive pricing, a record level ofbankruptcy filings and low receivablesgrowth. This was partly the result ofmortgage refinancing activity, whichpermitted consumers to use cash receivedin their mortgage refinancings to pay downcredit card debt. CCS was able to growearnings and originate a record number ofnew accounts by offering rewards-basedproducts, improving operating efficiency,delivering high-level customer service andimproving retention and card usage.Management believes that the shift towardsrewards-based products positions CCS tocapture consumer wallet share in a highlycompetitive, commoditized marketplace. In2003, CCS launched several new rewardsproducts, including the ChasePerfect card,the Marathon co-branded card and the GMSmall Business card.Operating revenue increased by 4% to $6.2billion. Net interest income increased by2%, reflecting lower funding costs, partlyoffset by a lower yield. The 4% growth inaverage receivables was in line withindustry trends. Noninterest revenueincreased by 6%, primarily reflectinghigher interchange revenue, partiallyoffset by higher rebate costs. Theincrease in interchange revenue reflectshigher purchase volume due to new accountgrowth and the movement towards higherspending using rewards-based products.During 2003, CCS originated 4.2&nbsp;millionnew accounts via multiple distributionchannels. CCS continuesto make progress in cross-sellingaccounts to other CFS customers (13% ofnew account originations). Thesemultiple-relationship accounts generatemore revenue and comprise 11% of theactive account base.Operating expense of $2.2&nbsp;billionincreased by 2%, reflecting disciplinedexpense management and Six Sigma andproductivity efforts. Growth in expenseswas primarily due to volume-related costs.Credit costs were $2.9&nbsp;billion, anincrease of 5% from 2002. The increase incredit costs primarily reflected 4% highernet charge-offs due to an increase inaverage outstandings.

CRB is compensated by CFS'scredit businesses for the home finance andcredit card loans it originates and doesnot retain these balances.While CRB continues to position itself forgrowth, decreased deposit spreads relatedto the low-rate environment and increasedcredit costs resulted in an 80% decline inCRB operating earnings from 2002. Thisdecrease was partly offset by an 8%increase in total average deposits.Operating revenue of $2.6&nbsp;billiondecreased by 9% compared with 2002. Netinterest income declined by 11% to $1.7billion, primarily attributable to thelower interest rate environment.Noninterest revenue decreased 6% to $927million due to lower deposit service fees,decreased debit card fees and one-timegains in 2002. CRB's revenue does notinclude funding profits earned on itsdeposit base; these amounts are includedin the results of Global Treasury.Operating expense of $2.4&nbsp;billionincreased by 7% from 2002. The increasewas primarily due to investments intechnology within the branch network; alsocontributing were higher compensationexpenses related to increased staff levelsand higher severance costs as a result ofcontinued restructuring. This increase inoperatingJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report42 Table of Contentsexpense was partly offset by Six Sigmaand other productivity efforts. CRB'soverhead ratio increased to 93% in 2003from 79% in 2002, reflecting both thedecline in revenues and an increase ofexpenses.Credit costs of $77&nbsp;million increased by$88&nbsp;million compared with 2002 primarilydriven by the release of the Allowancefor loan losses in 2002.Business-related metricsChase Middle MarketCMM is a premier provider of commercialbanking and corporate financial servicesto companies with annual sales of $10million to $1&nbsp;billion, as well as tonot-for-profit, real estate andpublic-sector entities.

NII was down 5% due to lowerspreads, partly offset by 17% higherdepositsand 3% higher loans compared with 2002.Noninterest revenue increased by 6%,primarily reflecting higher depositservice and corporate finance fees.Deposit service fees increased, as thelower interest rate environment resultedin reduced values of customers'compensating balances; consequently,customers paid incremental fees fordeposit services.Operating expense was $871&nbsp;million, anincrease of 4% compared with 2002. Theincrease in expenses was due to higherseverance costs and higherperformance-based incentives, partlyoffset by savings from Six Sigma and otherproductivity initiatives.Credit costs of $7&nbsp;million were down 90%from the prior year. This decrease wasdue to a lower required allowance and 36%lower net charge-offs, reflecting strongcredit quality.The focus for 2004 will be on generatingrevenue growth througheffective cross-selling, the delivery ofsuperior client service and the management of credit quality and expenses.Business-related metricsJ.P.

Thetechnology and procurement servicesorganizations seek to provide services tothe Firm's businesses that arecompetitive with comparable third-partyproviders in terms of price and servicequality. These units use the Firm'sglobal scale and technology to gainefficiencies through consolidation,standardization, vendor management andoutsourcing.Support Units and Corporate reflects theapplication of the Firm's managementaccounting policies at the corporatelevel. These policies allocate the costsassociated with technology, operationaland staff support services to the businesssegments, with the intent to recover allexpenditures associated with theseservices. Other items are retained withinSupport Units and Corporate based onpolicy decisions, such as the over/underallocation of economic capital, theresidual component of credit costs andtaxes. Business segment revenues arereported on a tax-equivalent basis, withthe offset reflected in Support Units andCorporate.During 2003, the Firm reviewed itsmanagement accounting policies, whichresulted in the realignment of certainrevenues and expenses from the Corporatesegment to other business segments. Thepolicy refinements ranged from updatingexpense-allocation methodologies torevising transfer pricing policies to moreclearly reflect the actual interest incomeand expense of the Firm. The impact ofthese changes was allocated among thebusiness segments; prior periods have beenrevised to reflect the currentmethodologies.For 2003, Support Units and Corporate hadoperating earnings of $44&nbsp;million,compared with an operating loss of $313million in 2002, driven primarily byincome tax benefits not allocated to thebusiness segments.In allocating the allowance (andprovision) for credit losses, eachbusiness is responsible for its creditcosts. Although the Support Units andCorporate sector has no traditional creditassets, the residual component of theallowance, which is available for lossesin any business segment, is maintained atthe corporate level. For a furtherdiscussion of the residual component, seeAllowance for credit losses on pages 64-65of this Annual Report.Average allocated capital was $2.9billion higher than 2002, reflecting areduction in risks and economic capitalallocated to the business segments.In December&nbsp;2002, JPMorgan Chase enteredinto a seven-year agreement with IBM tooutsource portions of the Firm's internaltechnology infrastructure services.Commencing April&nbsp;1, 2003, 2,800 employeeswere transferred to IBM in connection withthis agreement. The agreement is expectedto transform the Firm's technologyinfrastructure through increased costvariability, access to the best researchand innovation, and improved servicelevels. By moving from a traditionalfixed-cost approach to one with increasedcapacity and cost variability, the Firmexpects to be able to respond more quicklyto changing market conditions.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report44 Table of ContentsRisk and Capital managementRisk management at JPMorgan Chase isguided by several principles,including:Risk management and oversight begins withthe Risk Policy Committee of the Board ofDirectors, which reviews the governance ofthese activities, delegating theformulation of policy and day-to-day riskoversight and management to the Office ofthe Chairman and to two corporate risk committees: theCapital Committee and Risk ManagementCommittee.The Capital Committee, chaired by theChief Financial Officer, focuses onFirm-wide capital planning, internalcapital allocation and liquiditymanagement. The Risk Management Committee,chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, focuseson credit risk, market risk, operationalrisk, business risk, private equity riskand fiduciary risk. Both risk committeeshave decision-making authority, with majorpolicy decisions and risk exposuressubject to review by the Office of theChairman.In addition to the Risk Policy Committee,the Audit Committee of the Board ofDirectors is responsible for oversight ofguidelines and policies to govern theprocess by which risk assessment andmanagement is undertaken. In addition,the Audit Committee reviews withmanagement the system of internalcontrols and financial reporting that isrelied upon to provide reasonableassurance of compliance with the Firm'soperational risk management processes.The Firm's use of SVA, which incorporatesa risk-adjusted capital methodology as itsprimary performance measure, hasstrengthened its risk managementdiscipline by charging the businesses thecost of capital linked to the risksassociated with their respectiveactivities.For a discussion of capital allocationmethodologies, see the respective riskmanagement sections on pages 46&#150;74 ofthis Annual Report.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report45 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Capital and Liquidity managementCapital managementJPMorgan Chase's capital managementframework helps to optimize the use ofcapital by:Available versus required capitalEconomic risk capital: JPMorgan Chaseassesses capital adequacy utilizinginternal risk assessment methodologies.The Firm assigns economic capital basedprimarily on five risk factors: creditrisk, market risk, operational risk andbusiness risk for each business, andprivate equity risk, principally for JPMP.The methodologies quantify these risks andassign capital accordingly. Thesemethodologies are discussed in the riskmanagement sections of this Annual Report.A review of the Firm's risk and capitalmeasurement methodologies was completed in2003, resulting in the reallocation ofcapital among the risk categories andcertain business segments. The new capitalmeasurement methodologies did not resultin a significant change in the totalcapital allocated to the business segmentsas a whole.Prior periods have been adjusted toreflect the revised capital measurementmethodologies. For a further discussion ofthese new methodologies, see Capitalallocation for credit risk, operationalrisk and business risk, and private equityrisk on pages 52, 73 and 74, respectively,of this Annual Report. Internal capitalallocation methodologies may change in thefuture to reflect refinements of economiccapital methodologies.Capital also is assessed against businessunits for certain nonrisk factors.Businesses are assessed capital equal to100% of any goodwill and 50% for certainother intangibles generated throughacquisitions. Additionally, JPMorgan Chaseassesses an &#147;asset capital tax&#148; againstmanaged assets and some off-balance sheetinstruments. These assessments recognizethat certain minimum regulatory capitalratios must be maintained by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase also estimates theportfolio effect on required economiccapital based on correlations of riskacross risk categories. This estimateddiversification benefit leads to areduction in required economic capital forthe Firm.The total required economic capital forJPMorgan Chase as determined by its modelsand after considering the Firm's estimateddiversification benefits is then comparedwith available common stockholders' equityto evaluate overall capital utilization.The Firm's policy is to maintain anappropriate level of excess capital toprovide for growth and additionalprotection against losses.The Firm's capital in excess of that whichis internally required as of December&nbsp;31,2003, increased by $2.7&nbsp;billion overDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. The change wasprimarily due to an increase in averagecommon stockholders' equity of $1.6billion and to a $1.3&nbsp;billion reduction inaverage capital allocated to businessactivities, principally in relation tocredit risk and private equity risk.Credit risk capital decreased by $0.9billion from the prior year, primarily dueto a reduction in commercial exposures,improvement in the credit quality of thecommercial portfolio and an increase inhedging of commercial exposures usingsingle-name credit derivatives. Privateequity risk decreased primarily as aresult of the reduction in JPMP's privateequity portfolio.Regulatory capital: JPMorgan Chase'sprimary federal banking regulator, theFederal Reserve Board, establishes capitalrequirements, including well-capitalizedstandards and leverage ratios, for theconsolidated financial holding company andits state-chartered banks, includingJPMorgan Chase Bank. The Office of theComptroller of the Currency establishessimilar capital requirements and standardsfor the Firm's national bank subsidiaries,including Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A.As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the financialholding company and its bankingsubsidiaries maintained capital levelswell in excess of the minimum capitalrequirements.At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Tier 1 and Totalcapital ratios were 8.5% and 11.8%,respectively, and the Tier 1 leverageratio was 5.6%. The Capital Committeereviews the Firm's capital levels andpolicies regularly in light of changingeconomic conditions and business needs. AtDecember&nbsp;31, 2003, Total capital ofJPMorgan Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier2 capital) was $59.8&nbsp;billion, an increaseof $5.3&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2002.This increase reflected a $5.6&nbsp;billionincrease in Tier 1 capital, primarilydriven by a $3.8&nbsp;billion increase inretained earnings (net income less commonand preferred dividends) generated during theperiod, $1.1&nbsp;billion in Tier 1 trustpreferred net issuance and $1.3&nbsp;billion innet stock issuances related to employeestock-based benefit plans. This increasewas partially offset by a higher deductionfor goodwill and nonqualifyingJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report46 Table of Contentsintangible assets primarily due toan acquisition in the fourth quarter of2003. There was minimal impact to theFirm's Tier 1 and Total capital ratios dueto the adoption of FIN 46, as the FederalReserve Board provided interim regulatorycapital relief related to asset-backedcommercial paper conduits and trustpreferred vehicles. The effect of FIN 46on the Firm's leverage ratio at December31, 2003, was a reduction of approximately13 basis points as no regulatory capitalrelief was provided for leveragecalculations. The Firm revised itscalculation of risk-weighted assets duringthe third quarter of 2003; capital ratiosfor periods ended prior to June&nbsp;30, 2003,have not been recalculated. Additionalinformation regarding the Firm's capitalratios and a more detailed discussion offederal regulatory capital standards arepresented in Note 26 on pages 114-115 ofthis Annual Report.Stock repurchases: The Firm did notrepurchase any shares of its common stockduring 2003. Management expects torecommend to the Board of Directors thatthe Firm resume its share repurchaseprogram after the completion of thepending merger with Bank One.Dividends: Dividends declared in anyquarter are determined by JPMorgan Chase'sBoard of Directors. The dividend iscurrently $0.34 per share per quarter.Liquidity managementIn managing liquidity, managementconsiders a variety of liquidity riskmeasures as well as market conditions,prevailing interest rates, liquidityneeds and the desired maturity profileof its liabilities.OverviewLiquidity risk arises from the generalfunding needs of the Firm's activities andin the management of its assets andliabilities. JPMorgan Chase recognizes theimportance of sound liquidity managementas a key factor in maintaining strongcredit ratings and utilizes a liquidityframework intended to maximize liquidityaccess and minimize funding costs. Throughactive liquidity management, the Firmseeks to ensure that it will be able toreplace maturing obligations when due andfund its assets at appropriate maturitiesand rates in all market environments.Liquidity management frameworkThe Capital Committee sets the overallliquidity policy for the Firm, reviews thecontingency funding plan and recommendsbalance sheet targets for the Firm. TheLiquidity Risk Committee, reporting to theCapital Committee, identifies and monitorsliquidity issues, provides policy guidanceand maintains an evolving contingencyplan. The Balance Sheet Committee, whichalso reports to the Capital Committee,identifies and monitors key balance sheetissues, provides policy guidance andoversees adherence to policy.JPMorgan Chase utilizes liquiditymonitoring tools to help maintainappropriate levels of liquidity throughnormal and stress periods. The Firm'sliquidity analytics rely on management'sjudgment about JPMorgan Chase's ability toliquidate assets or use them as collateralfor borrowings. These analytics alsoinvolve estimates and assumptions, takinginto account credit risk management'shistorical data onthe funding of loan commitments (e.g.,commercial paper back-up facilities),liquidity commitments to SPEs, commitmentswith rating triggers and collateralposting requirements. For furtherdiscussion of SPEs and other off-balancesheet arrangements, see Off-balance sheetarrangements and contractual cashobligations on pages 49-50 as well as Note1, Note 13 and Note 14 on pages 86-87,100-103 and 103-106, respectively, of thisAnnual Report.The Firm's three primary measures of liquidity are:Each of the Firm's liquidity surpluspositions, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003,indicates that JPMorgan Chase's long-datedfunding, including core deposits, exceedsilliquid assets and that the Firm'sobligations can be met if access tofunding is temporarily impaired.An extension of the Firm's ongoingliquidity management is its contingencyfunding plan, which is intended to helpthe Firm manage through liquidity stressperiods. The plan considers temporary andlong-term stress scenarios and forecastspotential funding needs when access tounsecured funding is severely limited ornonexistent. These scenarios take intoaccount both on-and off-balance sheetexposures, evaluating access to funds bythe parent holding company, JPMorgan ChaseBank and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A.,separately.FundingCredit ratings: The cost and availabilityof unsecured financing are influenced bycredit ratings. A reduction in theseratings could adversely affect the Firm'saccess to liquidity sources, and couldincrease the cost of funding or triggeradditional collateral requirements.Critical factors in maintaining highcredit ratings include: a stable anddiverse earnings stream; strong capitalratios; strong credit quality and riskmanagement controls; diverse fundingsources; and strong liquidity monitoringprocedures.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report47 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.The credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase'sparent holding company and JPMorgan ChaseBank as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, were asfollows:Upon the announcement of the proposedmerger with Bank One, Moody's and Fitchplaced the ratings of the Firm under reviewfor possible upgrade, while S&P affirmedthe Firm's ratings.Balance sheet: The Firm's total assetsincreased to $771&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2003, from $759&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2002. The December&nbsp;31, 2003, balance sheetincludes the effect of adopting FIN 46,which added $10&nbsp;billion to total assets,including $5.8&nbsp;billion in commercial loansprimarily associated with multi-sellerasset-backed commercial paper conduits.Commercial loans declined $14.2&nbsp;billion,excluding the impact of adopting FIN 46,as a result of weaker loan demand, as wellas the Firm's ongoing efforts to reducecommercial exposure. Consumer loansincreased $11.6&nbsp;billion, led by stronggrowth in mortgage and automobile loans,driven by the favorable rate environmentthroughout 2003. Credit card loansdeclined modestly, affected by increasedsecuritization activity and higher levelsof payments from cash redeployed fromconsumer mortgage refinancings. Thesecurities portfolio declined due tochanges in positioning related tostructural interest rate risk management.The continued growth in depositscontributed to the decline in securitiessold under repurchase agreements.Sources of funds: The diversity of theFirm's funding sources enhances financialflexibility and limits dependence on anyone source, thereby minimizing the cost offunds. JPMorgan Chase has access to fundingmarkets across the globe and across a broadinvestor base. Liquidity is generated usinga variety of both short-term and long-terminstruments, including deposits, federalfunds purchased, repurchase agreements,commercial paper, bank notes, medium- andlong-term debt, capital securities andstockholders' equity. A major source ofliquidity for JPMorgan Chase Bank isprovided by its large core deposit base.For this purpose, core deposits include all U.S. domesticdeposits insured by the FDIC, up to thelegal limit of $100,000 per depositor. Inaddition to core deposits, the Firmbenefits from substantial, stable depositbalances originated by TSS through thenormal course of its business.Additional funding flexibility is providedby the Firm's ability to access therepurchase and asset securitizationmarkets. These alternatives are evaluatedon an ongoing basis to achieve theappropriate balance of secured andunsecured funding. The ability tosecuritize loans, and the associated gainson those securitizations, are principallydependent on the credit quality and yieldsof the assets securitized and are generallynot dependent on thecredit ratings of theissuing entity. Transactions between theFirm and its securitization structures arereflected in JPMorgan Chase's financialstatements; these relationships includeretained interests in securitizationtrusts, liquidity facilities and derivativetransactions. For further details, seeNotes 13 and 14 on pages 100-103 and103-106, respectively, of this Annual Report.Issuance: Corporate credit spreadsnarrowed in 2003 across industries andsectors, reflecting the market perceptionthat credit risks were improving sharplythroughout the year, as the number ofdowngrades declined, corporate balancesheet cash positions increased, andcorporate profits exceeded expectations.JPMorgan Chase's credit spreadsoutperformed relative to peer spreadsfollowing the Enron settlement, reflectingreduced headline risk and improvedearnings performance. This resulted in apositive overall shift in fixed incomeinvestor sentiment toward JPMorgan Chase,as evidenced by increased investorparticipation in debt transactions andextension of debt maturities. The Firmtook advantage of its narrowing creditspreads by issuing long-term debt andcapital securities opportunisticallythroughout the year.During 2003, JPMorgan Chase issuedapproximately $17.2&nbsp;billion of long-termdebt and capital securities. During theyear, $8.3&nbsp;billion of long-term debt andcapital securities matured or wasredeemed. In addition, in 2003 the Firmsecuritized approximately $13.3&nbsp;billion ofresidential mortgage loans, $8.8&nbsp;billionof credit card loans and $4.5&nbsp;billion ofautomobile loans, resulting in pre-taxgains on securitizations of $168&nbsp;million,$44&nbsp;million and $13&nbsp;million, respectively.For a further discussion of loansecuritizations, see Note 13 on pages100-103 of this Annual Report.During 2003, the Firm adopted FIN 46 and,as a result, deconsolidated the truststhat issue trust preferred securities.This could have significant implicationsfor the Firm's capital, because it maychange the way the Federal Reserve Boardviews the Tier 1 status of trust preferredsecurities. On July&nbsp;2, 2003, the FederalReserve Board issued a supervisory letterinstructing banks and bank holdingcompanies to continue to include trustpreferred securities in Tier 1 capital.Based on the terms of this letter and inconsultation with the Federal ReserveBoard, the Firm continues to include itstrust preferred securities in Tier 1capital. However, there can be noassurance that the Federal Reserve Boardwill continue to permit trust preferredsecurities to count as Tier 1 capital inthe future. For a further discussion, seeNote 18 on pages 110-111 of this AnnualReport.Derivatives are used in liquidity riskmanagement and funding to achieve theFirm's desired interest rate risk profile.The Firm enters into derivatives contractsto swap fixed-rate debt to floating-rateobligations and to swap floating-rate debtto fixed-rate obligations. Derivativescontracts are also used to hedge thevariability in interest rates that arisesfrom other floating-rate financialinstruments and forecasted transactions,such as the rollover of short-term assetsand liabilities.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report48 Table of ContentsOff-balance sheet arrangements andcontractual cash obligationsSpecial-purpose entitiesSpecial-purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;),special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;), orvariable-interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;), arean important part of the financialmarkets, providing market liquidity byfacilitating investors' access to specificportfolios of assets and risks. SPEs arenot operating entities; typically they areestablished for a single, discretepurpose, have a limited life and have noemployees. The basic SPE structureinvolves a company selling assets to theSPE. The SPE funds the asset purchase byselling securities to investors. Toinsulate investors from creditors of otherentities, including the seller of theassets, SPEs are often structured to bebankruptcy-remote. SPEs are critical tothe functioning of many investor markets,including, for example, the market formortgage-backed securities, otherasset-backed securities and commercialpaper. JPMorgan Chase is involved withSPEs in three broad categories oftransactions: loan securitizations(through &#147;qualifying&#148; SPEs), multi-sellerconduits, and client intermediation.Capital is held, as appropriate, againstall SPE-related transactions and relatedexposures such as derivative transactionsand lending-related commitments.The Firm has no commitments to issue itsown stock to support any SPE transaction,and its policies require that transactionswith SPEs be conducted at arm's length andreflect market pricing. Consistent withthis policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee ispermitted to invest in SPEs with which theFirm is involved where such investmentwould violate the Firm's Worldwide Rulesof Conduct. These rules prohibit employeesfrom self-dealing and prohibit employeesfrom acting on behalf of the Firm intransactions with which they or theirfamily have any significant financialinterest.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs,the Firm could be required to providefunding if the credit rating of JPMorganChase Bank were downgraded below specificlevels, primarily P-1, A-1 and F1 forMoody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch,respectively. The amount of theseliquidity commitments was $34.0&nbsp;billion atDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. If JPMorgan Chase Bankwere required to provide funding underthese commitments, the Firm could bereplaced as liquidity provider.Additionally, with respect to themulti-seller conduits and structuredcommercial loan vehicles for whichJPMorgan Chase Bank has extended liquiditycommitments, the Bank could facilitate thesale or refinancing of the assets in theSPE in order to provide liquidity.Of these liquidity commitments to SPEs,$27.7&nbsp;billion is included in the Firm'stotal Other unfunded commitments to extendcredit included in the table on thefollowing page. As a result of theconsolidation of multi-seller conduits inaccordance with FIN 46, $6.3&nbsp;billion ofthese commitments are excluded from thetable, as the underlying assets of the SPEhave been included on the Firm'sConsolidated balance sheet.The following table summarizes certainrevenue information related to VIEs withwhich the Firm has significantinvolvement, and qualifying SPEs:The revenue reported in the table aboverepresents primarily servicing fee income.The Firm also has exposure to certain VIEvehicles arising from derivativetransactions with VIEs; these transactionsare recorded at fair value on the Firm'sConsolidated balance sheet with changes infair value (i.e., mark-to-market gains andlosses) recorded in Trading revenue. SuchMTM gains and losses are not included inthe revenue amounts reported in the tableabove.For a further discussion of SPEs and theFirm's accounting for SPEs, see Note 1 onpages 86-87, Note 13 on pages 100-103,and Note 14 on pages 103-106 of thisAnnual Report.Contractual cash obligationsIn the normal course of business, the Firmenters into various contractualobligations that may require future cashpayments. Contractual obligations atDecember&nbsp;31, 2003, include Long-term debt,trust preferred capital securities,operating leases, contractual purchasesand capital expenditures and certain Otherliabilities. For a further discussionregarding Long-term debt and trustpreferred capital securities, see Note 18on pages 109-111 of this Annual Report.For a further discussion regardingoperating leases, see Note 27 on page 115of this Annual Report.The accompanying table summarizes JPMorganChase's off-balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments and significantcontractual cash obligations, by remainingmaturity, at December&nbsp;31, 2003.Contractual purchases include commitmentsfor future cash expenditures, primarilyfor services and contracts involvingcertain forward purchases of securitiesand commodities. Capital expendituresprimarily represent future cash paymentsfor real estate-related obligations andequipment. Contractual purchases andcapital expenditures at December&nbsp;31, 2003,reflect the minimum contractual obligationunder legally enforceable contracts withcontract terms that are both fixed anddeterminable. Excluded from the followingtable are a number of obligations to besettled in cash, primarily in under oneyear. These obligations are reflected onthe Firm's Consolidated balance sheet andinclude Deposits; Federal funds purchasedand securities sold under repurchaseagreements; Other borrowed funds;purchases of Debt and equity instrumentsthat settle within standard markettimeframes (e.g. regular-way); Derivativepayables that do not require physicaldelivery of the underlying instrument; andcertain purchases of instruments thatresulted in settlement failures.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report49 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase &Co.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report50 Table of ContentsCredit risk managementCredit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. The Firmis exposed to credit risk through its lending (e.g., loans and lending-relatedcommitments), trading and capital markets activities. Credit risk managementpractices are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of therisk-assessment process. Processes in place are intended to ensure that creditrisks are adequately assessed, properly approved, continually monitored andactively managed. Risk is managed at both the individual transaction andportfolio levels. The Firmassesses and manages all credit exposures, whether they arise from transactionsrecorded on- or off&#150;balance sheet.Credit risk organizationIn early 2003, the Credit Risk Policy and Global CreditManagement functions were combined to form Global Credit Risk Managementconsisting of the five primary functions listed in the organizational chartbelow.Business strategy and risk managementCommercialThe Firm's business strategy for its large corporate commercial portfolioremains primarily one of origination for distribution. The majority of theFirm's wholesale loan originations in IB continue to be distributed into themarketplace, with residual holds by the Firm averaging less than 10%. Thecommercial loan port-folio declined by 9% in 2003, reflecting a combination of continued weak loandemand, the Firm's ongoing goal of reducing commercial credit concentrationsand refinancings into more liquid capital markets. The Firm's SVA disciplinediscourages the retention of loan assets that do not generate a positive returnabove the cost of risk-adjusted capital. SVA remains a critical discipline inmaking loans and commitments, particularly when combined with other credit andcapital managementdisciplines.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report51 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.To measure commercial credit risk, the Firm estimates the likelihood of obligoror counterparty default; the amount of exposure should the obligor or thecounterparty default; and the loss severity given a default event. Based onthese factors and related market-based inputs, the Firm estimates both expectedand unexpected losses for each segment of the portfolio. Expected losses arestatistically-based estimates of credit losses over time, anticipated as aresult of obligor or counterparty default. They are used to set risk-adjustedcredit loss provisions. However, expected credit losses are not the soleindicators of risk. If losses were entirely predictable, the expected loss ratecould be factored into pricing and covered as a normal and recurring cost ofdoing business. Unexpected losses represent the potential volatility of actuallosses relative to the expected level of losses and are the basis for theFirm's credit risk capital-allocation process.In 2003, the Firm significantly modified its approach to commercial credit riskmanagement to further enhance risk management discipline, improve returns andliquidity and use capital more efficiently. Three primary initiatives werelaunched during the year: improved single-name and industry concentrationmanagement, through a revised threshold and limit structure; a revised capitalmethodology; and increased portfolio management activity utilizing creditderivatives and loan sales. The Firm manages capital and exposureconcentrations by obligor, risk rating, industry and geography. The Firm hasreduced by one-half the number of clients whose credit exposure exceeded thenarrowest definition of concentration limits during 2003, through focusedclient planning and portfolio management activities.A comprehensive review of the Firm's wholesale credit risk managementinfrastructure was completed in 2003. As a result, the Firm has commenced amulti-year initiative to reengineer specific components of the credit riskinfrastructure, including creation of a simpler infrastructure with morestandardized hardware and software platforms. The goal of the initiative is toenhance the Firm's ability to provide immediate and accurate risk and exposureinformation; actively manage credit risk in the residual portfolio; supportclient relationships; manage more quickly the allocation of economic capital;and support compliance with Basel II initiatives.ConsumerConsumer credit risks are monitored at the aggregate CFS level and within eachline of business (mortgages, credit cards, automobile finance, small businessand consumer banking).Consumer credit risk management uses sophisticated portfolio modeling, creditscoring and decision-support tools to project credit risks and establishunderwriting standards. Risk parameters are established in the early stages ofproduct development, and the cost of credit risk is an integral part of productpricing and evaluating profit dynamics. Losses generated by consumer loans aremore predictable than for commercial loans, but are subject to cyclical andseasonal factors. The frequency of loss is higher on consumer loans than oncorporate loans but the severity of losses is typically lower and moremanageable, depending on whether loans are secured or not. In addition, commonmeasures of credit quality derived from historical loss experience can be usedto predict con-sumer losses. Likewise, underwriting principles and philosophies are commonamong lenders focusing on borrowers of similar credit quality. For thesereasons, Consumer Credit Risk Management focuses on trends and concentrationsat the portfolio level, where problems can be remedied through changes inunderwriting policies and adherence to portfolio guidelines. Consumer CreditRisk Management also monitors key risk attributes, including borrower creditquality, loan performance (as measured by delinquency) and losses (expectedversus actual). The monthly and quarterly analysis of trends around theseattributes is monitored against business expectations and industry benchmarks.Capital allocation for credit riskUnexpected credit losses drive the allocation of credit risk capital byportfolio segment.In the commercial portfolio, capital allocations are differentiated by riskrating, loss severity, maturity, correlations and assumed exposure at default.In 2003, the Firm revised its methodology for the assessment of credit riskcapital allocated to the commercial credit portfolio, more closely aligningcapital with current market conditions. Specifically, the new approach employsestimates of default likelihood that are derived from current market parametersand is intended to capture the impact of both defaults and declines in marketvalue due to credit deterioration. This approach is intended to reflect moreaccuratelycurrent risk conditions, as well as to enhance the management of commercialcredit risk by encouraging the utilization of the growing market in creditderivatives and secondary market loan sales. See the Capital management sectionon pages 46&#150;47 of this Annual Report.Within the consumer businesses, capital allocations are differentiated byproduct and product segment. For the consumer portfolio, consumer products areplaced into categories with homogenous credit characteristics, from whichdefault rates and charge-offs can be estimated. Credit risk capital isallocated based on the unexpected loss inherent in those categories.Commercial and consumer credit portfolioJPMorgan Chase's total credit exposure (which includes $34.9&nbsp;billion ofsecuritized credit cards) was $730.9&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003, a 2%increase from year-end 2002. The increase reflected a change in the portfolio'scomposition: a $41.5&nbsp;billion increase in consumer exposure, partially offset bya $30.2&nbsp;billion decrease in commercial exposure.Managed consumer loans increased by $15.7&nbsp;billion, primarily resulting fromhigher levels of residential mortgage and automobile originations, whilelending-related commitments increased by $25.8&nbsp;billion, primarily in the homefinance and credit card businesses.Commercial exposure decreased by 7% to $382.7&nbsp;billion as of year-end 2003, theresult of an $8.5&nbsp;billion decrease in loans and a $22.4&nbsp;billion decrease inlending-related commitments. The decrease in loans outstanding reflected weakerdemand, as well as the Firm's ongoing credit management activities, including$5.2&nbsp;billion in loan and commitment sales. This was partially offsetJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report52 Table of Contentsby a $5.8&nbsp;billion increase related to VIEs consolidated in accordance with FIN 46.The decrease in lending-related commitments was due to an overall contractionin lending demand and reflected a $6.3&nbsp;billion decline due to the adoption ofFIN 46. For further discussion of FIN 46, see Note 14 on pages 103&#150;106 of thisAnnual Report.The Firm also views its credit exposure on an &#147;Economic&#148; basis, which is thebasis upon which it allocates credit capital to the lines of business. Theprincipal difference between the Firm's credit exposure on a reported basis andEconomic credit exposure relates to the way the Firm views its credit exposureto derivative receivables and lending-related commitments.For derivative receivables, the Firm measures its Economic credit exposureusing the Average exposure (&#147;AVG&#148;) metric. This is a measure of the expectedMTM value of the Firm's derivative receivables at future time periods,including the benefit of collateral. The three-year average of the AVG metricis the Firm's Economic measure of derivative risk since three years is theaverage remaining life of the derivatives portfolio; it was $34&nbsp;billion as ofDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. For more information, see the Derivative contracts sectionof this Annual Report.The following table reconciles Derivative receivables on a MTM basis with theFirm's Economic credit exposure basis, a non-GAAP financial measure.Reconciliation ofDerivative Receivables to Economic Credit ExposureFor commercial lending-related commitments, the Firm measures its Economiccredit exposure using a &#147;loan equivalent&#148; amount for each commitment, ratherthan the contractual amount of the lending-related commitment. The contractualamount represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty drawdown the commitment and subsequently default. However, most of thesecommitments expire without a default occurring or without being drawn. As aresult, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm'sview, representative of the Firm's actual future credit exposure or fundingrequirements. In determining the Firm's Economic credit exposure to commerciallending-related commitments, the Firm has established a &#147;loan-equivalent&#148;amount for each commitment. The loan-equivalent amount represents the portionof the unused commitment or other contingent exposure that is likely, based onaverage portfolio historical experience, to become outstanding in the event ofa default by the obligor. It is this amount that, in management's view,represents the Firm's Economic credit exposure to the obligor. The aggregateamount of its Economic credit exposure associated with commerciallending-related commitments was $106.9&nbsp;billion in 2003, compared with $115.5billion in 2002.The following table reconciles commercial lending&#150;related commitments on a GAAPbasis with the Firm's Economic credit exposure basis, a non-GAAP financialmeasure.Reconciliation ofCommercial Lending-Related Commitments to Economic Credit ExposureJ.P.

Morgan Chase & Co.The following table presents JPMorgan Chase's credit portfolio as of December31, 2003 and 2002:Commercial and consumer credit portfolioAs of December&nbsp;31, 2003, total Economic credit exposure was $572.4&nbsp;billion,compared with $548.0&nbsp;billion as of year-end 2002. Economic credit exposure for2003 was $572.4&nbsp;billion compared with 2003 credit exposure of $730.9&nbsp;billion.The Firm's allocated credit capital (including the benefit from creditderivative hedges) decreased significantly during 2003, to$10.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003, from $15.4&nbsp;billion at year-end 2002. The$5.1&nbsp;billion decrease was related to lower exposure in the commercialportfolio, hedging and loan sale activities, and significantly improved creditquality in the loan portfolio.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report54 Table of ContentsCommercial credit portfolioThe following table summarizes the maturity and ratings profiles of thecommercial portfolio as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. The ratings scale isbased on the Firm's internal risk ratings, and is presented on anS&P&#150;equivalent basis.At December&nbsp;31, 2003, 83% of the total commercial credit exposure of $383billion was considered investment-grade, an improvement from 80% at year-end2002. There was improvement across all components of credit exposure, mostsignificantlyin loans, as commercial criticized exposure declined by 47%, while the totalcommercial loan balance declined by 9%.Under the Firm's Economic view of credit exposure, the portion of the portfoliothat was deemed investment-grade improved to 80% as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, from74% at year-end 2002. In addition to the improved credit quality of loans andlending-related commitments, the investment-grade component of Derivativereceivables improved to 91% at year-end 2003 from 85% at the end of 2002.Commercial exposureCommercial exposure &#150; selected industry concentrationsDuring 2003, the Firm undertook a thorough analysis of industry riskcorrelations. As a result, the Firm developed a new industry structure,intended to provide stronger linkages between exposures with common riskattributes. The Firm expects these changes to enhance its ability to manageindustry risks consistently across regions and lines of business. Theimplementationof the new industry structure resulted in shifts in credit exposure, withincreases in some industries due to consolidation and decreases in others as aresult of realignments. In managing industry risk, the Firm recognizescustomers that have multiple industry affiliations in each industry category.However, the following table ranks exposures only by a customer's primaryindustry affiliation to prevent double counting.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report55 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.The industry distribution of the Firm's commercial credit exposure (loans,derivative receivables and lending-related commitments) under the new industrystructure, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, was as follows:Selected industry discussionPresented below is a discussion of several industries to which the Firm hassignificant exposure and which it continues tomonitor because of actual or potential credit concerns.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report56 Table of ContentsCommercial criticized exposureExposures deemed criticized generally represent a ratings profile similar to arating of CCC&#043;/Caa1 and lower, as defined by Standard & Poor's/Moody's. As ofyear-end 2003, the total $8.9&nbsp;billion in criticized exposure represented 2% oftotal commercial credit exposure and was down $7.7&nbsp;billion, or 47%, fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. The significant decrease was due to improved economicconditions, restructurings and capital markets refinancings during the year, inparticular in the Telecom services, Media and Utilities industries.The top five industries shown above total 50% of the total commercialcriticized exposure at December&nbsp;31, 2003. No industry below the top five islarger than 5% of the total.Enron-related exposureThe Firm's exposure to Enron and Enron-related entities was reduced by 11%during the year, from $688&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2002, to $609&nbsp;million atDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. The reduction was primarily due to the maturation of $50million of debtor-in-possession financing and repayments on secured exposures.At December&nbsp;31, 2003, secured exposure of $270&nbsp;million is performing and isreported on an amortized cost basis.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report57 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Country exposureThe Firm has a comprehensive process formeasuring and managing its countryexposures and risk. Exposures to a countryinclude all credit-related lending,trading and investment activities, whethercross-border or locally funded. Inaddition to monitoring country exposures,the Firm uses stress tests to measure andmanage the risk of extreme loss associatedwith sovereign crises.The table below presents the Firm'sexposure to selected countries. Theselection of countries is based on themateriality of the Firm's exposure and itsview of actual or potentially adversecredit conditions. Exposure amounts areadjusted for credit enhancements (e.g.,guarantees and letters of credit) providedby third parties located outside thecountry if the enhancements fully coverthe country risk, as well as thecommercial risk. Inaddition, the benefit of collateral,credit derivative hedges and other shortcredit or equity trading positions arereflected. Total exposure includesexposure to both government andprivate-sector entities in a country.The slight decrease in exposure to Brazilover the prior year-end was due toreductions in loans. The decline inMexican exposure when compared with theprior year was primarily due to loanmaturities and reductions in counterpartyexposure on derivatives. The reduction inSouth Korea was due to a combination ofloan maturities and trading activities.Hong Kong's exposure declined due to lowercounterparty exposure onderivatives. The increase in Russianexposure was due to cross-border and localtrading positions and short-term lending.Selected country exposure&nbsp;Derivative contractsIn the normal course of business, the Firmutilizes derivative instruments to meetthe needs of customers, to generaterevenues through trading activities, tomanage exposure to fluctuations ininterest rates, currencies and othermarkets and to manage its own credit risk.The Firm uses the same credit riskmanagement procedures to assess andapprove potential creditexposures when entering into derivativetransactions as those used fortraditional lending.The following table summarizes theaggregate notional amounts and thereported derivative receivables (i.e., theMTM or fair value of derivative contractsafter taking into account the effects oflegally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the datesindicated:Notional amounts and derivative receivables MTMJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report58 Table of ContentsThe $34 trillion of notional principal ofthe Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2003,significantly exceeds the possible creditlosses that could arise from suchtransactions. For most derivativetransactions, the notional principalamount does not change hands; it is simplyused as a reference to calculate payments.In terms of current credit risk exposure,the appropriate measure of risk is the MTMvalue of the contract. The MTM exposurerepresents the cost to replace thecontracts at current market rates shouldthe counterparty default. When JPMorganChase has more than one transactionoutstanding with a counterparty, and alegally enforceable master nettingagreement exists with the counterparty,the MTM exposure, less collateral held,represents, in the Firm's view, theappropriate measure of current credit riskwith that counterparty as of the reportingdate. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the MTM valueof derivative receivables (after takinginto account the effects of legallyenforceable master netting agreements) was$84&nbsp;billion. Further, after taking intoaccount $36&nbsp;billion of collateral held bythe Firm, the net current MTM creditexposure was $48&nbsp;billion.While useful as a current view of creditexposure, the net MTM value of thederivative receivables does not capturethe potential future variability of thatcredit exposure. To capture the potentialfuture variability of credit exposure,the Firm calculates, on aclient-by-client basis, three measures ofpotential derivatives-related creditloss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent(&#147;DRE&#148;) and Average exposure (&#147;AVG&#148;).This last measure is used as the basisfor the Firm's Economic credit exposureas defined on page 53 of this AnnualReport. These measures all incorporatenetting and collateral benefits whereapplicable.Peak exposure to a counterparty is anextreme measure of exposurecalculated at a 97.5% confidence level.However, the total potential future creditrisk embedded in the Firm's derivativesportfolio is not the simple sum of allPeak client credit risks. This is because,at the portfolio level, credit risk isreduced by the fact that when offsettingtransactions are done with separatecounterparties, only one of the two tradescan generate a credit loss even if bothcounterparties were to defaultsimultaneously. The Firm refers to thiseffect as market diversification, and theMarket-Diversified Peak (&#147;MDP&#148;) measure isa portfolio aggregation of counterpartyPeak measures, representing the maximumlosses at the 97.5% confidence level thatwould occur if all counterpartiesdefaulted under any one given marketscenario and timeframe.Derivative Risk Equivalent exposure is ameasure that expresses the riskiness ofderivative exposure on a basis intended tobe equivalent to the riskiness of loanexposures. This is done by equating theunexpected loss in a derivativecounterparty exposure (which takes into consideration boththe loss volatility and the credit rating of thecounterparty) with the unexpected lossin a loan exposure (which takes into consideration only the creditrating of thecounterparty). DRE is a less extrememeasure of the potential credit loss thanPeak, and is the primary measure used bythe Firm for credit approval of derivativetransactions.Finally, as described on page 53 of thisAnnual Report, Average exposure is ameasure of the expected MTM value of theFirm's derivative receivables at futuretime periods. The three-year average ofthe AVG is the basis of the Firm'sEconomic credit exposure, while AVGexposure over the total life of thederivative contract is used as theprimary metric for pricing purposes andis used to calculate credit capital andthe Credit Valuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;).The chart below shows the exposureprofiles to derivatives over the next 10years as calculated by the MDP, DRE andAVG metrics. All three measures generallyshow declining exposure after the firstyear, if no new trades were added to theportfolio.The MTM value of the Firm's derivativereceivables incorporates an adjustment toreflect the credit quality ofcounterparties. This is called CVA and was$635&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003,compared with $1.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2002. The CVA is based on the Firm's AVGto a counterparty, and on thecounterparty's credit spread in thecredit derivatives market. The primarycomponents of changes in CVA are creditspreads, new deal activity or unwinds, andchanges in the underlying marketenvironment. The CVA decrease in 2003 wasprimarily due to the dramatic reduction incredit spreads during the year. For adiscussion of the impact of CVA on Tradingrevenue, see portfolio management activityon pages 60-61 of this Annual Report.The Firm believes that active riskmanagement is essential to controllingthe dynamic credit risk in thederivatives portfolio. The Firm hedgesits exposure to changes in CVA byentering into credit derivativetransactions, as well as interest rate,foreign exchange, equity and commodityderivatives transactions.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report59 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.The table below summarizes the ratingsprofile, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, of theFirm's balance sheet derivative receivablesMTM, net of cash and other highly liquidcollateral:Ratings profile of derivative receivables MTMThe Firm actively pursues the use ofcollateral agreements to mitigatecounterparty credit risk in derivatives.The percentage of the Firm's derivativestransactions subject to collateralagreements increased to 78% on December31, 2003, from 67% on December&nbsp;31, 2002.The increase of collateralizedtransactions was driven largely by newcollateral agreements. The Firm held $36billion of collateral as of December&nbsp;31,2003, compared with $30&nbsp;billion as ofDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. The Firm posted $27billion of collateral at year-end 2003,compared with $19&nbsp;billion at the end of2002.Certain derivative and collateralagreements include provisions that requireboth the Firm and the counterparty, uponspecified downgrades in their respectivecredit ratings, to post collateral for thebenefit of the other party. The impact onrequired collateral of a single-notchratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank,from its current rating of AA- to A&#043;,would have been an additional $1.3&nbsp;billionof collateral as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. Theimpact of a six-notch ratings downgrade toJPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- to BBB-)would have been $3.7&nbsp;billion of additionalcollateral from levels as of December&nbsp;31,2003. The amount of additional collateralrequired upon downgrade moves in tandemwith the mark-to-market value of thederivatives portfolio and ranged (withrespect to a six-notch downgrade) from$3.4&nbsp;billion to $4.2&nbsp;billion throughout2003, as the level of U.S. interest rateschanged. Certain derivatives contractsalso provide for termination of thecontract, generally upon JPMorgan ChaseBank being downgraded, at thethen-existing MTM value of the derivativereceivables.Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the notionalamounts of credit derivatives protectionbought and sold at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and2002:Credit derivative positionsJPMorgan Chase has limited counterpartyexposure as a result of credit derivativestransactions. Of the $84&nbsp;billion of totalderivative receivables at December&nbsp;31,2003, approximately $3&nbsp;billion, or 4%, wasassociated with credit derivatives, beforethe benefit of collateral. The use ofcredit derivatives to manage exposures doesnot reduce the reported level of assets onthe balance sheet or the level of reportedoff&#150;balance sheet commitments.Portfolio management activityIn managing its commercial creditexposure, the Firm purchases single-nameand portfolio credit derivatives to hedgeits exposures. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003,the notional outstanding amount ofprotection purchased via single-name andportfolio credit derivatives was $35billion and $2&nbsp;billion, respectively. TheFirm also diversifies its exposures byproviding (i.e., selling) small amounts ofcredit protection, which increasesexposure to industries or clients wherethe Firm has little or no client-relatedexposure. This activity is not material tothe Firm's overall credit exposure; creditprotection sold totaled $67&nbsp;million innotional exposure at December&nbsp;31, 2003.Use of single-name and portfolio credit derivativesThe credit derivatives used by JPMorganChase for its portfolio managementactivities do not qualify for hedgeaccounting under SFAS 133. Thesederivatives are marked to market in Tradingrevenue. The MTM value incorporates boththe cost of hedge premiums and changes invalue due to movement in spreads and creditevents, whereas the loans andlending-related commitments being hedgedare accounted for on an accrual basis inNet interest income and assessed forimpairment in the Provision for creditJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report60 Table of Contentslosses. This asymmetry in accountingtreatment between loans andlending-related commitments and the creditderivatives utilized in the portfoliomanagement activities causes earningsvolatility that is not representative ofthe true changes in value of the Firm'soverall credit exposure. The MTM treatmentof both the Firm's credit derivativehedges (&#147;short&#148; credit positions) and theCVA, which reflects the credit quality ofderivatives counterparty exposure (&#147;long&#148;credit positions), provides some naturaloffset. Additionally, the Firm activelymanages its commercial credit exposurethrough loan sales. During 2003, the Firm sold$5.2&nbsp;billion of loans and commitments, ofwhich $1.3&nbsp;billion was criticized.The 2003 portfolio management activityresulted in $191&nbsp;million of lossesincluded in Trading revenue. These lossesincluded $746&nbsp;million related to creditderivatives that were used to hedge theFirm's credit exposure, of whichapproximately $504&nbsp;million was associatedwith credit derivatives used to hedgeaccrual lending activities and theremainder primarily hedged the credit riskof MTM derivative receivables. The losseswere generally driven by an overall globaltightening of credit spreads. The $746million loss was largely offset by $555million of trading revenue gains primarilyrelated to the decrease in the MTM valueof the CVA due to credit spreadtightening. During 2003, the quarterlyportfolio management Trading revenueresults ranged from a net loss of $12million in the third quarter to a net lossof $119&nbsp;million in the second quarter.Dealer/client activityJPMorgan Chase's dealer activity in creditderivatives is client-driven. The businessacts as a market-maker in single-namecredit derivatives and also structuresmore complex transactions for clients'investment or risk management purposes.The credit derivatives trading functionoperates within the same framework asother market-making desks. Risk limits areestablished and closely monitored.As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the totalnotional amounts of protection purchasedand sold by the dealer business were $264billion and $276&nbsp;billion, respectively.The mismatch between these notionalamounts is attributable to the Firmselling protection on large, diversified,predominantly investment-grade portfolios(including the most senior tranches) andthen hedging these positions by buyingprotection on the more subordinatedtranches of the same portfolios. Inaddition, the Firm may use securities tohedge certain derivative positions.Consequently, while there is a mismatch innotional amounts of credit derivatives,the Firm believes the risk positions arelargely matched.Consumer credit portfolioThe Firm's managed consumer loan portfoliototaled $171.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2003, an increase of 10% from 2002.Consumer lending&#150;related commitmentsincreased by 17% to $176.9&nbsp;billion atDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. The following tablepresents a summary of consumer creditexposure on a managed basis:Consumer portfolioJPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolioconsists primarily of 1&#150;4 familyresidential mortgages, credit cards andautomobile financings. The consumerportfolio is predominantly U.S.-based. Thefollowing pie graph provides a summary ofthe consumer portfolio by loan type atyear-end 2003 and each loan type's netcharge-off rate.The Firm's largest component, 1&#150;4 familyresidential mortgage loans is primarilysecured by first mortgages, and at December 31, 2003comprised 43% of the total consumerportfolio. The risk of these loans is theprobability the consumer will default andthat the value of the home will beinsufficient to cover the mortgage pluscarrying costs. Mortgage loans for 1&#150;4family residences at December&nbsp;31, 2003,increased by 10% compared with last yearto $54.5&nbsp;billion. Home equity loans andhome equity lines of credit totaled $19.3billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003, an increaseJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report61 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.of $4.6&nbsp;billion, or 31%, from 2002. Theseloans and lines are secured by first andsecond mortgages. The risks are similar tothose of first mortgages; however, lossseverity can increase when the Firm is in asecond-lien position. As of December&nbsp;31,2003, 88% of home equity loans and lines ofcredit were secured by second liens.Borrowers with home equity lines of creditare approved for a line of credit for up to10&nbsp;years. The Firm has a future fundingliability in situations where the borrowerdoes not make use of the line of creditimmediately but has the right to draw downthe commitment at any time. As of December31, 2003, outstandings under home equitylines were $16.6&nbsp;billion andunused commitments were $23.4&nbsp;billion(included in the $28.8&nbsp;billion of 1&#150;4family residential mortgage lending-relatedcommitments). The business actively managesthe unused portion of these commitments andfreezes a commitment when the borrowerbecomes delinquent. These accounts are thensubject to proactive default management,with the objective of minimizing potentiallosses.The Firm analyzes its credit cardportfolio on a managed basis, whichincludes credit card receivables on theConsolidated balance sheet and those thathave been securitized. Credit cardcustomers are initially approved for aspecific revolving credit line. For openaccounts (those in good standing and ableto transact), the difference between theapproved line and the balance outstandingin the customer's account is referred toas &#147;open-to-buy.&#148; The Firm is exposed tochanges in the customer's credit standingand therefore must calculate the aggregatesize of this unused exposure and managethe potential credit risk. The size of thecredit line and resulting open-to-buybalance is adjusted by the Firm based onthe borrower's payment and general creditperformance. Managed credit cardreceivables increased by $1.3&nbsp;billion, or2%, during 2003. The managed netcharge-off rate of 5.87% was unchangedfrom 2002.Automobile financings grew by 15% toapproximately $38.7&nbsp;billion, while the netcharge-off rate improved from 0.57% in2002 to 0.45% in 2003.The following chart presents the geographical concentration of the U.S.consumer loans by region for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002.The following table presents the geographical concentration ofconsumer loans by product for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002.Consumer loans by geographic region (a) J.P.

Morgan Chase & Co.Nonperforming assets decreased by $1.7billion, or 35%, during the year endedDecember&nbsp;31, 2003, to $3.1&nbsp;billion. Thedecrease was due to activity in thecommercial portfolio: total reductions,including repayments, loan sales and netcharge-offs exceeded new additions,resulting in net reductions of $1.7billion. By contrast, there werecommercial net additions during 2002. Adecline in exposure to the Telecomservices, Utilities and Media industriesaccounted for more than half of theoverall $1.7&nbsp;billion decrease.CommercialCommercial nonperforming loans decreasedby 45%, to $2.0&nbsp;billion as of December31, 2003, from $3.7&nbsp;billion at year-end2002. Over the same period, nonperformingcommercial loans as a percentage of totalcommercial loans fell to 2.42% from4.01%. Commercial loan net charge-offs in2003 were $816&nbsp;million, compared with$1.9&nbsp;billion in 2002, the result ofimproved credit quality in the portfolioand increased recoveries resulting fromrestructurings. There were no netcharge-offs of commercial lending&#150;relatedcommitments in 2003, compared with $212million in 2002. The average annual netcharge-off rate for commercial loansimproved significantly, to 0.91% in 2003from 1.93% in 2002.Commercial net charge-offs in 2004 areexpected to decline, but at a slowerpace than in the second half of 2003.ConsumerThe $21&nbsp;million decrease in consumernonperforming loans reflected improvedcredit quality in the portfolio. While netcharge-offs increased by $92&nbsp;millionduring the year reflecting a 10% growth in the portfolio, the average annual netcharge-off rate declined to 1.96% from2.30% during 2002.In 2004, the amount of gross charge-offsis expected to increase due to growth inoutstandings, but net charge-off rates areexpected to remain stable.Allowance for credit lossesJPMorgan Chase's Allowance for creditlosses is intended to cover probablecredit losses, including losses where theasset is not specifically identified orthe size of the loss has not beendetermined. At least quarterly, the Firm'sRisk Management Committee reviews theAllowance for credit losses relative tothe risk profile of the Firm's creditportfolio and current economic conditions.The allowance is adjusted based on thatreview if, in management's judgment,changes are warranted. The allowanceincludes specific and expected losscomponents and a residual component. Forfurther discussion of the components ofthe Allowance for credit losses, seeCritical accounting estimates used by theFirm on pages 75&#150;76 and Note 12 on page100 of this Annual Report. At December&nbsp;31,2003, management deemed the allowance forcredit losses to be appropriate to absorblosses that currently may exist but arenot yet identifiable.Summary of changes in the allowance&nbsp; Table of ContentsCredit costsLoansThe commercial specific loss componentof the allowance was $917&nbsp;million atDecember&nbsp;31, 2003, a decrease of 43%from year-end 2002. The decrease wasattributable to the improvement in thecredit quality of the commercial loanportfolio, as well as the reduction inthe size of the portfolio.The commercial expected loss component ofthe allowance was $454&nbsp;million at December31, 2003, a decrease of 26% from year-end2002. The decrease reflected animprovement in the average quality of theloan portfolio, as well as the improvingcredit environment, which affected inputsto the expected loss model.The consumer expected loss component ofthe allowance was $2.3&nbsp;billion at December31, 2003, a decrease of 4% from year-end2002. Although the consumer managed loanportfolio increased by 10%, the businessesthat drove the increase, Home Finance andAuto Finance, have collateralized productswith lower expected loss rates.The residual component of the allowancewas $895&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003.The residual component, whichincorporates management's judgment,addresses uncertainties that are notconsidered in the formula-basedcommercial specific and expectedcomponents of the allowance for creditlosses.The $121&nbsp;million increase addresseduncertainties in the economic environmentand concentrations in the commercial loanportfolio that existed during the firsthalf of 2003. In the second half of theyear, as commercial credit qualitycontinued to improve and the commercialallowance declined further, the residualcomponent was reduced as well. At December31, 2003, the residual componentrepresented approximately 20% of the totalallowance for loan losses, within theFirm's target range of between 10% and20%. The Firm anticipates that if thecurrent positive trend in economicconditions and credit quality continues,the commercial and residual componentswill continue to be reduced.Lending-related commitmentsTo provide for the risk of loss inherentin the credit-extension process,management also computes specific andexpected loss components as well as aresidual component for commerciallending&#150;related commitments. This iscomputed using a methodology similar tothat used for the commercial loanportfolio, modified for expectedmaturities and probabilities of drawdown.The allowance decreased by 11% to $324million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, due toimprovement in the criticized portion ofthe Firm's lending-related commitments.&nbsp; Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P.

Itstrives to make the Firm's market riskprofile transparent to senior management,the Board of Directors and regulators.The chart below depicts the MRMorganizational structure and describesthe responsibilities of the groupswithin MRM.MRM works in partnership with thebusiness segments, which are expected tomaintain strong risk discipline at alllevels. Forexample, risk-taking businesses haveMiddle Office functions that actindependently from trading personnel andare responsible forverifying risk exposures they take. Weeklymeetings are held between MRM and theheads of risk-taking businesses, todiscuss and decide on risk exposures inthe context of the market environment andclient flows.Key terms:&nbsp;&nbsp; Table of ContentsThere are also groups that report to theChief Financial Officer with someresponsibility for market risk-relatedactivities. For example, within theFinance area, the valuation controlfunctions are responsible for ensuring theaccuracy of the valuations of positionsthat expose the Firm to market risk.Positions that expose the Firm to marketrisk are classified into two categories.Trading risk includes positions held aspart of a business whose strategy is totrade, make markets or take positions forthe Firm's own trading account; gains andlosses in these positions are reported inTrading revenue. Nontrading risk includesmortgage banking positions held forlonger-term investment and positions usedto manage the Firm's asset/liabilityexposures. In most cases, unrealized gainsand losses in these positions areaccounted for at fair value, with thegains and losses reported in Net income orOther comprehensive income.Tools used to measure risksBecause no single measure can reflect allaspects of market risk, the Firm usesseveral measures, both statistical andnonstatistical, including:Value-at-RiskJPMorgan Chase's statistical risk measure,VAR, gauges the potential loss fromadverse market moves in an ordinary marketenvironment and provides a consistentcross-business measure ofrisk profiles and levels of riskdiversification. VAR is used to comparerisks across businesses, to monitor limitsand to allocate economic capital to thebusiness segments. VAR provides risktransparency in a normal tradingenvironment.Each business day, the Firm undertakes acomprehensive VAR calculation thatincludes both trading and nontradingactivities. JPMorgan Chase's VARcalculation is highly granular, comprisingmore than 1.5&nbsp;million positions and240,000 pricing series (e.g., securitiesprices, interest rates, foreign exchangerates). For a substantial portion of itsexposure, the Firm has implementedfull-revaluation VAR, which, managementbelieves, generates the most accurateresults.To calculate VAR, the Firm useshistorical simulation, which measuresrisk across instruments and portfolios ina consistent, comparable way. Thisapproach assumes that historical changesin market value are representative offuture changes. The simulation is basedon market data for the previous 12months.The Firm calculates VAR using a one-daytime horizon and a 99% confidence level.This means the Firm would expect toincur losses greater than that predictedby VAR estimates only once in every 100trading days, or about 2.5 times a year.All statistical models involve a degree ofuncertainty, depending on the assumptionsthey employ. The Firm prefers historicalsimulation, because it involves fewerassumptions about the distribution ofportfolio losses than parameter-basedmethodologies. In addition, the Firmregularly assesses the quality of themarket data, since their accuracy iscritical to computing VAR. Nevertheless,because VAR is based on historical marketdata, it may not accurately reflect futurerisk during environments in which marketvolatility is changing. In addition, theVAR measure on any particular day may notbe indicative of future risk levels, sincepositions and market conditions may bothchange over time.While VAR is a valuable tool forevaluating relative risks and aggregatingrisks across businesses, it only measuresthe potential volatility of dailyrevenues. Profitability and risk levelsover longer time periods &#150; a fiscalquarter or a year &#150; may be only looselyrelated to the average value of VAR overthose periods. First, while VAR measurespotential fluctuations around averagedaily revenue, the average itself couldreflect significant gains or losses; forexample, from client revenues thataccompany risk-taking activities. Second,large trading revenues may result frompositions taken over longer periods oftime. For example, a business may maintainan exposure to rising or falling interestrates over a period of weeks or months. Ifthe market exhibits a long-term trend overthat time, the business could experiencelarge gains or losses, even though revenuevolatility on each individual day may havebeen small.VAR BacktestingTo evaluate the soundness of its VARmodel, the Firm conducts daily backtestingof VAR against actual financial results,based on daily market risk&#150;relatedrevenue. Market risk&#150;related revenue isdefined as the daily change in value ofthe mark-to-market trading portfolios plusany trading-related net interest income,brokerage commissions, underwriting feesor other revenue. The Firm's definition ofmarket risk&#150;related revenue is consistentwith the Federal Reserve Board'simplementation of the Basel Committee'smarket risk capital rules. The histogrambelow illustrates the Firm'sdaily market risk&#150;related revenue fortrading businesses for 2003. The chartshows that the Firm posted positive dailymarket risk&#150;related revenue on 235 out of260&nbsp;days in 2003, with 170&nbsp;days exceeding$25&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained on 25days; nine of those days were in the thirdquarter, primarily driven by poor overalltrading results. The largest daily tradingloss during the year was $100&nbsp;million.&nbsp; Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.The inset in the histogram examines the 25days on which the Firm posted tradinglosses and depicts the amount by which VARwas greater than the actual loss on eachday. There was one day on which tradinglosses exceeded VAR by approximately 10%,a performance statistically consistentwith the Firm's 99% confidence level.During the third quarter, there was anadditional dayon which the Firm's losses exceeded VAR;these losses were attributable tocertain positions in the mortgagebanking business, which were thenincluded in the Firm's tradingportfolio, but which are now included inthe nontrading portfolio with othermortgage banking positions.Economic-value stress testingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due tounlikely events in normal markets, stresstesting captures the Firm's exposure tounlikely but plausible events in abnormalmarkets. Stress testing is equallyimportant as VAR in measuring andcontrolling risk. Stress testing enhancesthe understanding of the Firm's riskprofile and loss potential and is used formonitoring limits, cross-business riskmeasurement and economic capitalallocation.Economic-value stress tests measure thepotential change in the value of theFirm's portfolios. Applying economic-valuestress tests helps the Firm understand howthe economic value of its balance sheet(not the amounts reported under GAAP)would change under certain scenarios. TheFirm conducts economic-value stress testsfor both its trading and its nontradingactivities, using the same scenarios forboth.The Firm stress tests its portfolios atleast once a month using multiplescenarios. Several macroeconomicevent-related scenarios are evaluatedacross the Firm, with shocks to roughly10,000 marketprices specified for each scenario.Additional scenarios focus on the riskspredominant in individual businesssegments and include scenarios that focuson the potential for adverse moves incomplex portfolios.Scenarios are continually reviewed andupdated to reflect changes in the Firm'srisk profile and economic events.Stress-test results, trends andexplanations are provided each month tothe Firm's senior management and to thelines of business, to help them bettermeasure and manage risks and to understandevent risk-sensitive positions.The Firm's stress-test methodology assumesthat, during an actual stress event, nomanagement action would be taken to changethe risk profile of portfolios. Thisassumption captures the decreasedliquidity that often occurs with abnormalmarkets and results, in the Firm's view,in a conservative stress-test result.It is important to note that VAR resultscannot be directly correlated tostress-test loss results for threereasons. First, stress-test losses arecalculated at varying dates each month,while VAR isJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report68 Table of Contentsperformed daily and disclosed at theperiod-end date. Second, VAR and stresstests are two distinct risk measurementsyielding very different loss potentials.Thus, although the same trading portfoliosare used for both tests, VAR is based on adistribution of one-day historical lossesmeasured over the most recent one year; bycontrast, stress testing subjects theportfolio to more extreme, larger movesover a longer time horizon (e.g., 2-3weeks). Third, as VAR and stress tests aredistinct risk measurements, the impact ofportfolio diversification can varygreatly. For VAR, markets can change inpatterns over a one-year time horizon,moving from highly correlated to less so;in stress testing, the focus is on asingle event and the associatedcorrelations in an extreme marketsituation. As a result, while VAR over agiven time horizon can be lowered by adiversification benefit in the portfolio,this benefit would not necessarilymanifest itself in stress-test scenarios,which assume large, coherent moves acrossall markets.Net interest income stress testingThe VAR and stress-test measures describedabove illustrate the total economicsensitivity of the Firm's balance sheet tochanges in market variables. The effect ofinterest rate exposure on reported Netincome is also critical. The Firm conductssimulations of Net interest income for itsnontrading activities under a variety ofinterest rate scenarios, which areconsistent with the scenarios used foreconomic-value stress testing.Net interest income stress tests measurethe potential change in the Firm's NIIover the next 12&nbsp;months. These stresstests highlight exposures to variousinterest rate-sensitive factors, such asrates(e.g., the prime lending rate), pricingstrategies on deposits and changes inproduct mix. These stress tests also takeinto account forecasted balance sheetchanges, such as asset sales andsecuritizations, as well as prepaymentand reinvestment behavior.RIFLEIn addition to VAR, JPMorgan Chase employsthe Risk identification for largeexposures (&#147;RIFLE&#148;) methodology as anotherstatistical risk measure. The Firmrequires that all market risk-takingbusinesses self-assess their risks tounusual and specific events. Individualswho manage risk positions, particularlycomplex positions, identify potentialworst-case losses that could arise from anunusual or specific event, such as apotential tax change, and estimate theprobabilities of such losses. Through theFirm's RIFLE system, this information isthen directed to the appropriate level ofmanagement, thereby permitting the Firm toidentify further earnings vulnerabilitiesnot adequately covered by VAR and stresstesting.Nonstatistical risk measuresNonstatistical risk measures other thanstress testing include net open positions,basis point values, option sensitivities,position concentrations and positionturnover. These measures provideadditional information on an exposure'ssize and the direction in which it ismoving. Nonstatistical measures are usedfor monitoring limits, one-off approvalsand tactical controls.The table below shows both trading and nontrading VAR by risk type, togetherwith the Corporate total. Details of the VAR exposures are discussed in theTrading Risk and Nontrading Risk sections below.VAR by risk typeJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report69 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Trading RiskMajor risksInterest rates: Interest rate risk (whichincludes credit spread risk) involves thepotential decline in net income orfinancial condition due to adverse changesin market interest rates, which may resultin changes to NII, securities valuations,and other interest-sensitive revenues andexpenses.Foreign exchange, equities and commodities:These risks involve the potential declinein net income or financial condition due toadverse changes in foreign exchange,equities or commodities markets, whetherdue to proprietary positions taken by theFirm, ordue to a decrease in the level of clientactivity.Hedge fund investments: The Firm invests innumerous hedge funds that have variousstrategic goals, investment strategies,industry concentrations, portfolio sizesand management styles. Fund investments arepassive long-term investments. Individualhedge funds may have exposure to interestrate, foreign exchange, equity andcommodity risk within their portfolio riskstructures.Trading VARThe largest contributor to trading VAR wasinterest rate risk. Before portfoliodiversification, interest rate riskaccounted for roughly 60% of the averageTrading Portfolio VAR. The diversificationeffect, which on average reduced the dailyaverage Trading Portfolio VAR by $38million in 2003, reflects the fact that thelargest losses for different positions andrisks do not typically occur at the sametime. The risk of a portfolio of positionsis therefore usually less than the sum ofthe risks of the positions themselves. Thedegree of diversification is determinedboth by the extent to which differentmarket variables tend to move together, andby the extent to which different businesseshave similar positions.The increase in year-end VAR was driven byan increase in the VAR for equities risk,which was attributable to a significantincrease in customer-driven business inequity options. In general, over the courseof a year, VAR exposures can varysignificantly as trading positions changeand market volatility fluctuates.Economic-value stress testingThe following table represents theworst-case potential economic-valuestress-test loss (pre-tax) in the Firm'strading portfolio as predicted bystress-test scenarios:Trading economic value stress-test loss results &#151; pre-taxThe potential stress-test loss as ofDecember&nbsp;4, 2003, is the result of the&#147;Equity Market Collapse&#148; stress scenario,which is broadly modeled on the events ofOctober&nbsp;1987. Under this scenario, globalequity markets suffer a sharp reversalafter a long sustained rally; equity pricesdecline globally; volatilities forequities, interest rates and creditproducts increase dramatically for shortmaturities and less so for longermaturities; sovereign bond yields declinemoderately; and swap spreads and creditspreads widen moderately.Nontrading RiskMajor risk &#151; Interest ratesThe execution of the Firm's core businessstrategies, the delivery of products andservices to its customers, and thediscretionary positions the Firm undertakesto risk-manage structural exposures giverise to interest rate risk in itsnontrading activities.This exposure can result from a variety offactors, including differences in thetiming between the maturity or repricing ofassets, liabilities and off-balance sheetinstruments. Changes in the level and shapeof interest rate curves may also createinterest rate risk, since the repricingcharacteristics of the Firm's assets do notnecessarily match those of its liabilities.The Firm is also exposed to basis risk,which is the difference in the repricingcharacteristics of two floating-rateindices, such as the prime rate and 3-monthLIBOR. In addition, some of the Firm'sproducts have embedded optionality that mayhave an impact on pricing and balancelevels.The Firm manages exposure in its structuralinterest rate activities on a consolidated,corporate-wide basis. Business unitstransfer their interest rate risk to GlobalTreasury through a transfer pricing system,which takes into account the elements ofinterest rate exposure that can be hedgedin financial markets. These elementsinclude current balance and contractualrates of interest, contractual principalpayment schedules, expected prepaymentexperience, interest rate reset dates andmaturities and rate indices used forre-pricing. All transfer pricingassumptions are reviewed on a semiannualbasis and must be approved by the Firm'sCapital Committee.The Firm's mortgage banking activities alsogive rise to complex interest rate risks.The interest rate exposure from the Firm'smortgage banking activities is a result ofoption and basis risks. Option risk arisesfrom prepayment features in mortgages andMSRs, and from the probability of newlyoriginated mortgage commitments actuallyclosing. Basis risk results from differentrelative movements between mortgage ratesand other interest rates. These risks aremanaged through hedging programs specificto the different mortgage bankingactivities. Potential changes in the marketvalue of MSRs and increased amortizationlevels of MSRs are managed via a riskmanagement program that attempts to offsetchanges in the market value of MSRs withchanges in the market value of derivativesand investment securities. A similarapproach is implemented to manage theinterest rate and option risks associatedwith the Firm's mortgage originationbusiness.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report70 Table of ContentsNontrading VARFor nontrading activities that involvemarket risk, VAR measures the amount ofpotential change in their economic value;however, it is not a measure of reportedrevenues, since those activities are notmarked to market through earnings.The increase in average, maximum andDecember&nbsp;31 nontrading portfolio VAR wasprimarily attributable to the increase inmarket volatility during the 2003 thirdquarter, and to the rise in interest ratesin the second half of 2003, which increasedthe sensitivity of mortgage instruments tothe basis risk between mortgage rates andother interest rates.Economic-value stress testingThe Firm conducts both economic-value andNII stress tests on its nontradingactivities. Economic-value stress testsmeasure the potential change in the valueof these portfolios under the samescenarios used to evaluate the tradingportfolios.The following table represents thepotential worst-case economic-valuestress-test loss (pre-tax) in the Firm'snontrading portfolio as predicted bystress-test scenarios:Nontrading economic-value stress-test loss results &#151; pre-taxThe potential stress-test loss as ofDecember&nbsp;4, 2003, is the result of the&#147;Credit Crunch&#148; stress scenario, which isbroadly based on the events of 1997-98.Under that scenario, political instabilityin emerging markets leads to a flight toquality; sovereign bond yields declinemoderately; the U.S. dollar declinesagainst the euro and Japanese yen; creditspreads widen sharply; mortgage spreadswiden; and equity prices declinemoderately.Net interest income stress testingThe following table shows the change in theFirm's NII over the next 12&nbsp;months thatwould result from uniform increases ordecreases of 100 basis points in allinterest rates. It also shows the largestdecline in the Firm's NII under the samestress-test scenarios utilized for thetrading portfolio. At year-end 2003,JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NIIstress-test loss was estimated at $160million, primarily the result of increasedfunding costs.Nontrading NII stress-test loss results &#151; pre-taxNonstatistical measuresThe Firm also calculates exposures todirectional interest rate changes and tochanges in the spread between the swapcurve and other basis risks. At year-end,the market value of the Firm's nontradingpositions did not have a significantexposure to increases or decreases ininterest rates. However, the Firm'snon-trading positions maintain an exposureto the spread between mortgage rates andswap rates; at year-end the Firm wasexposed to a widening of this spread.Capital allocation for market riskThe Firm allocates market risk capitalguided by the principle thatcapital should reflect the extent to whichrisks are present in businesses. DailyVAR, monthly stress-test results and otherfactors determine appropriate capitalcharges for major business segments. TheVAR measure captures a large number ofone-day price moves, while stress testscapture a smaller number of very largeprice moves. The Firm allocates marketrisk capital to each business segmentaccording to a formula that weights thatsegment's VAR and stress-test exposures.Risk monitoring and controlLimitsMarket risk is primarily controlled througha series of limits. The sizes of the limitsreflect the Firm's risk appetite afterextensive analyses of the marketenvironment and business strategy. Theanalyses examine factors such as marketvolatility, product liquidity, businesstrack record, and management experience anddepth.The Firm maintains different levels oflimits. Corporate-level limits encompassVAR calculations and stress-test lossadvisories. Similarly, business-segmentlevels include limits on VAR calculations,nonstatistical measurements and P&L lossadvisories. Businesses are responsible foradhering to established limits, againstwhich exposures are monitored and reporteddaily. An exceeded limit is reportedimmediately to senior management, and theaffected business unit must takeappropriate action to comply with thelimit. If the business cannot do thiswithin an acceptable timeframe, seniormanagement is consulted on the appropriateaction.MRM regularly reviews and updates risklimits, and the Firm's Risk ManagementCommittee reviews and approves risklimits at least twice a year. MRM furthercontrols the Firm's exposure byspecifically designating approvedfinancial instruments for each businessunit.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report71 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Qualitative reviewMRM also performs periodic reviews of bothbusinesses and products with exposure tomarket risk in order to assess the abilityof the businesses to control market risk.The business management's strategy, marketconditions, product details andeffectiveness of risk controls arereviewed. Specific recommendations forimprovements are made to management.Model reviewMany of the Firm's financial instrumentscannot be valued based on quoted marketprices but are instead valued usingpricing models. Such models are used formanagement of risk positions, such asreporting risk against limits, and forvaluation. The Firm reviews the models ituses to assess model appropriateness andconsistency across businesses. The modelreviews consider anumber of issues: appropriateness of themodel, assessing the extent to which itaccurately reflects the characteristics ofthe transaction and captures itssignificant risks; independence andreliability of data sources;appropriateness and adequacy of numericalalgorithms; and sensitivity to inputparameters or other assumptions whichcannot be priced from the market.Reviews are conducted for new or changedmodels, as well as previously acceptedmodels. Re-reviews assess whether therehave been any material changes to theaccepted models; whether there have beenany changes in the product or market thatmay impact the model's validity; andwhether there are theoretical orcompetitive developments that may requirereassessment of the model's adequacy. Fora summary of valuations based on models,see Critical accounting estimates used bythe Firm on pages 76-77 of this AnnualReport.&nbsp;Operational risk managementOperational risk is the risk of lossresulting from inadequate or failedprocesses or systems, human factors, orexternal events.OverviewOperational risk is inherent in each ofthe Firm's businesses and supportactivities. Operational risk can manifestitself in various ways, including errors,business interruptions, inappropriatebehavior of employees and vendors that donot perform in accordance withoutsourcing arrangements. These eventscan potentially result in financiallosses and other damage to the Firm,including reputational harm.To monitor and control operational risk,the Firm maintains a system ofcomprehensive policies and a controlframework designed to provide a sound andwell controlled operational environment.The goal is to keep operational risk atappropriate levels, in light of the Firm'sfinancial strength, the characteristics ofits businesses, the markets in which itoperates, and the competitive andregulatory environment to which it issubject.Notwithstanding these control measures,the Firm incurs operational losses. TheFirm's approach to operational riskmanagement is intended to mitigate suchlosses.Operational risk management practicesThroughout 2003, JPMorgan Chase continuedto execute a multi-year plan, begun in2001, for an integrated approach thatemphasizes active management ofoperational risk throughout the Firm. Theobjective of this effort is to supplementthe traditional control-based approach tooperational risk with risk measures, toolsand disciplines that are risk-specific,consistently applied and utilizedFirm-wide. Key themes for this effort aretransparency of information, escalation ofkey issues and accountability for issueresolution. Ultimate responsibility forthe Firm's operational risk managementpractices resides with the Chief RiskOfficer. The components are:Governance structure: The governancestructure provides the framework for theFirm's operational risk managementactivities. Primary responsibility formanaging operational risk rests withbusiness managers. These individuals areresponsible for establishing andmaintaining appropriate internal controlprocedures for their respectivebusinesses.The Operational Risk Committee, whichmeets quarterly, is composed of senioroperational risk and finance managers fromeach of the businesses. In addition, eachof the businesses must maintain businesscontrol committees to oversee theiroperational risk management practices.Self-assessment process: In 2003, JPMorganChase continued to refine its Firm-wideself-assessment process. The goal of theprocess was for each business to identifythe key operational risks specific to itsenvironment and assess the degree to whichit maintained appropriate controls. Actionplans were developed for control issuesidentified, and businesses are to be heldaccountable for tracking and resolvingthese issues on a timely basis.Self-assessments were completed by thebusinesses through the use of Horizon, asoftware application developed by theFirm. With the aid of Horizon, allbusinesses were required to performsemiannual self-assessments in 2003. Goingforward, the Firm will utilize theself-assessment process as a dynamic riskmanagement tool.Operational risk-event monitoring: TheFirm has a process for reportingoperational risk-event data, permittinganalyses of errors and losses as well astrends. Such analyses, performed both at aline-of-business level and by risk eventtype, enable identification of root causesassociated with risk events faced by thebusinesses. Where available, the internaldata can be supplemented with externaldata for comparative analysis withindustry patterns. The data reported willenable the Firm to back-test againstself-assessment results.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report72 Table of ContentsIntegrated reporting: The Firm ispresently designing an operational riskarchitecture model to integrate the aboveindividual components into a unified,web-based tool. When fully implemented,this model will enable the Firm to enhanceits reporting and analysis of operationalrisk data, leading to improved riskmanagement and financial performance.Audit alignment: In addition to conductingindependent internal audits, the Firm'sinternal audit group provided guidance onthe design and implementation of theoperational risk framework. This guidancehas helped further the Firm-wideimplementation of the framework, which inturn has led to a stronger overall controlenvironment. The internal audit grouputilizes the business self-assessmentresults to help focus its internal auditson operational control issues. The groupalso reviews the effectiveness andaccuracy of the business self-assessmentprocess during the conduct of its audits.Operational Risk CategoriesFor purposes of analysis and aggregation,the Firm breaks operational risk eventsdown into five primary categories:Compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Section&nbsp;404The Firm intends to use, as much aspossible, its existing corporategovernance and operational risk managementpractices to satisfy the requirements ofSection&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Actregarding internal control over financialreporting. The Firm is currently in the processof evaluating the requirements of Section 404 and of implementing additional procedures intoits existing practices. TheFirm intends to be in fullcompliance with the requirements of theAct when they become effective in 2004.For a further discussion on the Act, seepage 79 of this Annual Report.Capital allocation for operational and business riskDuring 2003, the Firm implemented a newrisk-based capital allocation methodologywhich estimates operational and businessrisk independently, on a bottoms-upbasis, and allocates capital to eachcomponent. Implementation of the newmethodology in 2003 resulted in anoverall lower amount of capital allocatedto the lines of business with respect tooperational and business risks.The operational risk capital model isbased on actual losses and potentialscenario-based stress losses, withadjustments to the capital calculation toreflect changes in the quality of thecontrol environment and with a potentialoffset for the use of risk-transferproducts. The Firm believes the model isconsistent with the proposed Basel IIAccord and expects to propose it eventuallyfor qualification under the AdvancedMeasurement Approach for operational risk.Business risk is defined as the riskassociated with volatility in the Firm'searnings due to factors not captured byother parts of its economic-capitalframework. Such volatility can arise fromineffective design or execution ofbusiness strategies, volatile economic orfinancial market activity, changing clientexpectations and demands, andrestructuring to adjust for changes in thecompetitive environment. For businessrisk, capital is allocated to eachbusiness based on historical revenuevolatility and measures of fixed andvariable expenses. Earnings volatilityarising from other risk factors, such ascredit, market, or operational risk, isexcluded from the measurement of businessrisk capital, as those factors arecaptured under their respective riskcapital models.Reputation and Fiduciary riskA firm's success depends not only on itsprudent management of credit, market,operational and business risks, butequally on the maintenance of itsreputation among many constituents &#151; clients, investors, regulators, as wellas the general public &#151; for businesspractices of the highest quality.Attention to its reputation has alwaysbeen a key aspect of the Firm's practices,and maintenance of reputation is theresponsibility of everyone at the Firm.JPMorgan Chase bolsters this individualresponsibility in many ways: the WorldwideRules of Conduct, training, policies andoversight functions that approvetransactions. These oversight functionsinclude a Conflicts Office, which examinestransactions with the potential to createconflicts of interest or role for theFirm.In addition, the Firm maintains aFiduciary Risk Management Committee(&#147;FRMC&#148;) to oversee fiduciary-relatedrisks that may produce significant lossesor reputational damage, and that are notcovered elsewhere by the corporate riskmanagement oversight structure. Theprimary goal of the fiduciary riskmanagement function is to ensure that abusiness, in providing investment or riskmanagement products or services, performsat the appropriate standard relative toits relationship with a client, whether itbe fiduciary or nonfiduciary in nature. Aparticular focus of the FRMC is thepolicies and practices that address abusiness's responsibilities to a client,including the policies and practices thataddress client suitability determination,disclosure obligations and performanceexpectations with respect to theinvestment and risk management products orservices being provided. In this way, theFRMC provides oversight of the Firm'sefforts to measure, monitor and controlthe risks that may arise in the deliveryof such products or services to clients,as well as those stemming from itsfiduciary responsibilities undertaken onbehalf of employees.The Firm has an additional structure toaccount for potential adverse effects onits reputation from transactions withclients, especially complex derivativesand structured finance transactions. Thisstructure, implemented in 2002, reinforcesthe Firm's procedures for examiningtransactions in terms of appropriateness,ethical issues and reputational risk, andit intensifies the Firm'sJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report73 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.scrutiny of the purpose and effect of itstransactions from the client's point ofview, with the goal that thesetransactions are not used to misleadinvestors or others. The structureoperates at three levels: as part of everybusiness's transaction approval process;through review by regional Policy ReviewCommittees; and through oversight by thePolicy Review Office.Business transaction approvalPrimary responsibility for adherence tothe policies and procedures designed toaddress reputation risk lies with thebusiness units conducting the transactionsin question. The Firm's transactionapproval process requires review andsign-off from, among others, internallegal/compliance, conflicts, tax andaccounting policy groups. Transactionsinvolving an SPE established by the Firmreceive particular scrutiny and mustcomply with a Special-Purpose VehiclePolicy, designed to ensure that every suchentity is properly approved, documented,monitored and controlled.Regional policy review committeesBusiness units are also required to submitto regional Policy Review Committeesproposed transactions that may heightenreputationrisk &#151; particularly a client's motivationand its intended financial disclosure ofthe transaction. The committees approve,reject or require further clarificationon or changes to the transactions. Themembers of these committees are seniorrepresentatives of the business andsupport units in the region. Thecommittees may escalate transactionreview to the Policy Review Office.Policy Review OfficeThe Policy Review Office is the mostsenior approval level for clienttransactions involving reputation riskissues. The mandate of the Office is toopine on specific transactions brought bythe Regional Committees and considerchanges in policies or practices relatingto reputation risk. The head of the officeconsults with the Firm's most seniorexecutives on specific topics and providesregular updates. Aside from governance andguidance on specific transactions, theobjective of the policy review process isto reinforce a culture, through a &#147;casestudy&#148; approach, that ensures that allemployees, regardless of seniority,understand the basic principles ofreputation risk control and can recognizeand address issues as they arise.&nbsp;Private equity risk managementRisk managementJPMP employs processes for riskmeasurement and control of private equityrisk that are similar to those used forother businesses within the Firm. Theprocesses are coordinated with the Firm'soverall approach to market andconcentration risk. Private equity risk isinitially monitored through the use ofindustry and geographic limits.Additionally, to manage the pace of newinvestments, a ceiling on the amount ofannual private equity investment activityhas been established.JPMP's public equity holdings create asignificant exposure to general declinesin the equity markets. To gauge thatrisk, VAR and stress-test exposures arecalculated in the same way as they arefor the Firm's trading and nontradingportfolios. JPMP management undertakesfrequent reviews of its public securityholdings as part of a disciplinedapproach to sales and hedging issues.Hedging programs are limited but areconsidered whenpractical and as circumstances dictate.Over time, the Firm may change the natureand type of hedges it enters into, aswell as close hedging positionsaltogether.Capital allocation for private equity riskInternal capital is allocated to JPMP'spublic equities portfolio based on stressscenarios which reflect the potentialloss inherent in the portfolio in theevent of a large equity market decline.Capital is also allocated for liquidityrisk, which results from the contractualsales restrictions to which some holdingsare subject. For private equities,capital is allocated based on a long-termequity market stress scenario that isconsistent with the investment timehorizonsassociated with these holdings. For theseinvestments, additional capital isallocated against the risk of anunexpectedly large number of write-offsor write-downs. The Firm refined itsmethodology for measuring private equityrisk during the second quarter of 2003.It now assigns a moderately higher amountof capital for the risk in the privateequity portfolio, most of which isassigned to JPMP.&nbsp;Critical accounting estimates used by the FirmThe Firm's accounting policies and use ofestimates are integral to understandingthe reported results. The Firm's mostcomplex accounting estimates requiremanagement's judgment to ascertain thevaluation of assets and liabilities. TheFirm has established detailed policies andcontrol procedures intended to ensurevaluation methods, including any judgmentsmade as part of such methods, are wellcontrolled, independently reviewed andapplied consistently from period toperiod.In addition, the policies and procedures areintended to ensure that the process forchanging methodologies occurs in anappropriate manner. The Firm believes itsestimates for determining the valuationof its assets and liabilities areappropriate.The following is a brief description ofthe Firm's critical accounting estimatesinvolving significant management valuationjudgments.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report74 Table of ContentsAllowance for Credit LossesJPMorgan Chase's Allowance for creditlosses covers the commercial and consumerloan portfolios as well as the Firm'sportfolio of commercial lending-relatedcommitments. The allowance for loan lossesis intended to adjust the value of theFirm's loan assets for probable creditlosses as of the balance sheet date inaccordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles. Management alsocomputes an allowance for lending-relatedcommercial commitments using a methodologysimilar to that used for the commercialloan portfolio. For a further discussionof the methodologies used in establishingthe Firm's Allowance for credit losses,see Note 12 on page 100 of this AnnualReport.Commercial loans and lending-related commitmentsThe methodology for calculating both theAllowance for loan losses and theAllowance for lending-related commitmentsinvolves significant judgment. First andforemost, it involves the earlyidentification of credits that aredeteriorating. Second, it involvesmanagement judgment to derive lossfactors.The Firm uses a risk rating system todetermine the credit quality of its loans.Commercial loans are reviewed forinformation affecting the obligor'sability to fulfill its obligations. Inassessing the risk rating of a particularloan, among the factors considered includethe obligor's debt capacity and financialflexibility, the level of the obligor'searnings, the amount and sources ofrepayment, the level and nature ofcontingencies, management strength, andthe industry and geography in which theobligor operates. These factors are basedon an evaluation of historical informationand current information as well assubjective assessment and interpretation.Emphasizing one factor over another orconsidering additional factors that may berelevant in determining the risk rating ofa particular loan, but which are notcurrently an explicit part of the Firm'smethodology, could impact the risk ratingassigned by the Firm to that loan.Management also applies its judgment toderive loss factors associated with eachcredit facility. These loss factors aredetermined by facility structure,collateral and type of obligor. Whereverpossible, the Firm uses independent,verifiable data or the Firm's ownhistorical loss experience in its modelsfor estimating these loss factors. Manyfactors can affect management's estimatesof specific loss and expected loss,including volatility of defaultprobabilities, rating migrations and lossseverity. For example, judgment isrequired to determine how many years ofdata to include when estimating thepossible severity of the loss. If a fullcredit cycle is not captured in the data,then estimates may be inaccurate.Likewise, judgment is applied to determinewhether the loss-severity factor should becalculated as an average over the entirecredit cycle or whether to apply theloss-severity factor implied at aparticular point in the credit cycle. Theapplication of different loss-severityfactors would change the amount of theallowance for credit lossesdetermined appropriate by the Firm.Similarly, there are judgments as to whichexternal data on default probabilitiesshould be used, and when they should beused. Choosing data that are notreflective of the Firm's specific loanportfolio characteristics could affectloss estimates.As noted above, the Firm's allowance forloan losses is sensitive to the riskrating assigned to a loan. Assuming aone-notch downgrade in the Firm's internalrisk ratings for all its commercial loans,the allowance for loan losses for thecommercial portfolio would increase byapproximately $470&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,2003. Furthermore, assuming a 10% increasein the loss severity on all downgradednon-criticized loans, the allowance forcommercial loans would increase byapproximately $50&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,2003. These sensitivity analyses arehypothetical and should be used withcaution. The purpose of these analyses isto provide an indication of the impactrisk ratings and loss severity have on theestimate of the allowance for loan lossesfor commercial loans. It is not intendedto imply management's expectation offuture deterioration in risk ratings orchanges in loss severity. Given theprocess the Firm follows in determiningthe risk ratings of its loans andassessing loss severity, managementbelieves the risk ratings and lossseverities currently assigned tocommercial loans are appropriate.Furthermore, the likelihood of aone-notch downgrade for all commercialloans within a short timeframe isremote.Consumer loansThe consumer portfolio is segmented intothree main business lines: Chase HomeFinance, Chase Cardmember Services andChase Auto Finance. For each majorportfolio segment within each line ofbusiness, there are three primary factorsthat are considered in determining theexpected loss component of the allowancefor loan losses: period-end outstandings,expected loss factor and average life. Thevarious components of these factors, suchas collateral, prepayment rates, creditscore distributions, collections and thehistorical loss experience of a businesssegment, differ across business lines. Forexample, credit card revolving credit hassignificantly higher charge-off ratiosthan fixed mortgage credit.Determination of each factor is basedprimarily on statistical data andmacroeconomic assumptions.Residual componentManagement's judgments are also appliedwhen considering uncertainties that relateto current macroeconomic and politicalconditions, the impact of currencydevaluation on cross-border exposures,changes in underwriting standards,unexpected correlations within theportfolio or other factors. For example,judgment as to political developments in aparticular country will affectmanagement's assessment of potential lossin the credits that have exposure to thatcountry. A separate allowance component,the residual component, is maintained tocover these uncertainties, at December&nbsp;31,2003, in theJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report75 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.commercial portfolio. It is anticipatedthat the residual component will rangebetween 10% and 20% of the totalallowance for credit losses.Fair value of financial instrumentsA portion of JPMorgan Chase's assets andliabilities are carried at fair value,including trading assets and liabilities,AFS securities and private equityinvestments. Held-for-sale loans andmortgage servicing rights are carried atthe lower of fair value or cost. AtDecember&nbsp;31, 2003, approximately $346billion of the Firm's assets wererecorded at fair value.Fair value of a financial instrument isdefined as the amount at which theinstrument could be exchanged in a currenttransaction between willing parties, otherthan in a forced or liquidation sale. Themajority of the Firm's assets reported atfair value are based on quoted marketprices or on internally developed modelsthat are based on independently sourcedmarket parameters, including interest rateyield curves, option volatilities andcurrency rates.The valuation process takes intoconsideration factors such as liquidityand concentration concerns and, for thederivative portfolio, counterparty creditrisk. See the discussion of CVA on page59 of this Annual Report. Managementapplies judgment in determining thefactors used in the valuation process.For example, there is often limitedmarket data to rely on when estimatingthe fair value of a large or agedposition. Similarly, judgment must beapplied in estimating prices for lessreadily observable external parameters.Finally, other factors such as modelassumptions, market dislocations andunexpected correlations can affectestimates of fair value. Imprecision inestimating these factors can impact theamount of revenue or loss recorded for aparticular position.Trading and available-for-sale portfoliosSubstantially all of the Firm's securitiesheld for trading and investment purposes(&#147;long&#148; positions) and securities that theFirm has sold to other parties but doesnot own (&#147;short&#148; positions) arevalued based on quoted market prices.However, certain securities are lessactively traded and, therefore, are notalways able to be valued based on quotedmarket prices. The determination of theirfair value requires management judgment,as this determination may requirebenchmarking to similar instruments oranalyzing default and recovery rates.As few derivative contracts are listed onan exchange, the majority of the Firm'sderivative positions are valued usinginternally developed models that use astheir basis readily observable marketparameters &#151; that is, parameters that areactively quoted and can be validated toexternal sources, includingindustry-pricing services. Certainderivatives, however, are valued based onmodels with significant unobservablemarket parameters &#151; that is, parametersthat may be estimated and are, therefore,subject to management judgment tosubstantiate the model valuation. Theseinstruments are normally either lessactively traded or trade activity isone-way. Examples include long-datedinterest rate or currency swaps, whereswap rates may be unobservable for longermaturities; and certain credit products,where correlation and recovery rates areunobservable.Management judgment includes recordingfair value adjustments (i.e.,reductions) to model valuations toaccount for parameter uncertainty whenvaluing complex or less actively tradedderivative transactions.The table below summarizes the Firm'strading and AFS portfolios by valuationmethodology at December&nbsp;31, 2003:To ensure that the valuations areappropriate, the Firm has various controlsin place. These include: an independentreview and approval of valuation models;detailed review and explanation for profitand loss analyzed daily and over time;decomposing the model valuations forcertain structured derivative instrumentsinto their components and benchmarkingvaluations, where possible, to similarproducts; and validating valuationestimates through actual cash settlement.As markets and products develop and thepricing for certain derivative productsbecomesmore transparent, the Firm refines itsvaluation methodologies. The ValuationControl Group within the Finance area isresponsible for reviewing the accuracy ofthe valuations of positions taken withinthe Investment Bank.For a discussion of market riskmanagement, including the model reviewprocess, see Market Risk Management onpages 66-72 of this Annual Report. Forfurther details regarding the Firm'svaluation methodologies, see Note 31 onpages 120-123 of this Annual Report.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report76 Table of ContentsLoans held-for-saleThe fair value of loans in theheld-for-sale portfolio is generallybased on observable market prices ofsimilar instruments, including bonds,credit derivatives and loans with similarcharacteristics. If market prices are notavailable, fair value is based on theestimated cash flows, adjusted for creditrisk that is discounted using a rateappropriate for each maturity thatincorporates the effects of interest ratechanges.Private equity investmentsValuation of private investments held byJPMP requires significant managementjudgment due to the absence of quotedmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidityand long-term nature of such assets.Private investments are initially valuedbased on cost. The carrying values ofprivate investments are adjusted from costto reflect both positive and negativechanges evidenced by financing events withthird-party capital providers. Inaddition, these investments are subject toongoing impairment reviews by JPMP'ssenior investment professionals. A varietyof factors are reviewed and monitored toassess impairment including, but notlimited to, operating performance andfuture expectations, industry valuationsof comparable public companies, changes inmarket outlook and the third-partyfinancing environment over time. TheValuation Control Group within the Financearea is responsible for reviewing theaccuracy of thecarrying values of private investmentsheld by JPMP. For additional informationabout private equity investments, seethe Private equity risk managementdiscussion on page 74 and Note 15 onpage 106 of this Annual Report.MSRs and certain other retained interestsMSRs and certain other retained interestsfrom securitization activities do nottrade in an active, open market withreadily observable prices. For example,sales of MSRs do occur, but the preciseterms and conditions are typically notreadily available. Accordingly, the Firmestimates the fair value of MSRs andcertain other retained interests using adiscounted future cash flow model. Themodel considers portfolio characteristics,contractually specified servicing fees andprepayment assumptions, delinquency rates,late charges, other ancillary revenues,costs to service and other economicfactors. The Firm compares its fair valueestimates and assumptions to observablemarket data where available, to recentmarket activity and to actual portfolioexperience. Management believes that thefair values and related assumptions arecomparable to those used by other marketparticipants. For a further discussion ofthe most significant assumptions used tovalue these retained interests, as well asthe applicable stress tests for thoseassumptions, see Notes 13 and 16 on pages100-103 and 107-109, respectively, of thisAnnual Report.&nbsp;Nonexchange-traded commodity contracts at fair valueIn the normal course of business, JPMorganChase trades nonex-change-traded commoditycontracts. To determine the fair value ofthese contracts, the Firm uses variousfair value estimation techniques, whichare primarily based on internal modelswith significant observable marketparameters. The Firm's nonex-change-traded commodity contracts areprimarily energy-related contracts. Thefollowing table summarizes the changes infair value for nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts for the year endedDecember&nbsp;31, 2003:The following table indicates the schedule of maturities of nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts at December&nbsp;31, 2003:J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report77 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Accounting and reporting developmentsAccounting for stock-based compensationEffective January&nbsp;1, 2003, JPMorgan Chaseadopted SFAS 123, which establishes theaccounting for stock-based compensationand requires that all such transactions,including stock options, be accounted forat fair value and be recognized inearnings. Awards outstanding as ofDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, if not subsequentlymodified, continue to be accounted forunder APB 25. For a further discussion onthe adoption of SFAS 123, see Note 7 onpages 93-95 of this Annual Report.Consolidation of variable interest entitiesIn January&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued FIN 46.Entities that would be assessed forconsolidation under FIN 46 are typicallyreferred to as Special-Purpose Entities(&#147;SPEs&#148;), although non-SPE-type entitiesmay also be subject to the guidance. FIN46 requires a variable interest entity(&#147;VIE&#148;) to be consolidated by a company ifthat company is subject to a majority ofthe risk of loss from the variableinterest entity's activities or entitledto receive a majority of the entity'sresidual returns, or both. EffectiveFebruary&nbsp;1, 2003, the Firm implemented FIN46 for VIEs created or modified afterJanuary&nbsp;31, 2003, in which the Firm has aninterest.Effective July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Firm adoptedthe provisions of FIN 46 for all VIEsoriginated prior to February&nbsp;1, 2003,excluding certain investments made byJPMP. The FASB provided a specificdeferral for nonregistered investmentcompanies until the proposed Statement ofPosition on the clarification of the scopeof the Investment Company Audit Guide isfinalized, which is expected to occur inmid-2004. The Firm has deferredconsolidation of $2.7&nbsp;billion ofadditional assets related to JPMP as ofDecember&nbsp;31, 2003. For further detailsregarding FIN 46, refer to Note 14 onpages 103-106 of this Annual Report.In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued arevision to FIN 46 (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;) to addressvarious technical corrections andimplementation issues that have arisensince its issuance. The provisions of FIN46R are effective for financial periodsending after March&nbsp;15, 2004, thus the Firmwill implement the new provisionseffective March&nbsp;31, 2004. As FIN 46R wasrecently issued and contains provisionsthat the accounting profession continuesto analyze, the Firm's assessment of theimpact of FIN 46R on all VIEs with which itis involved is ongoing. However, at thistime and based on management's currentinterpretation, the Firm does not believethat the implementation of FIN 46R willhave a material impact on the Firm'sConsolidated financial statements,earnings or capital resources.Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equityIn May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150,which establishesstandards for how an issuer classifies andmeasures in its statement of financialposition certain financial instrumentswith characteristics of both liabilitiesand equity. It requires that an issuerclassi-fy a financial instrument that is withinits scope as a liability (or an asset insome circumstances), because thatfinancial instrument embodies anobligation of the issuer. Initially, SFAS150 was effective for all financialinstruments entered into or modified afterMay&nbsp;31, 2003, and was otherwise effectivebeginning July&nbsp;1, 2003. In November&nbsp;2003,the FASB deferred the effective date ofthe statement with respect to mandatorilyredeemable financial instruments ofcertain nonpublic entities and for certainmandatorily redeemable noncontrollinginterests. The implementation of SFAS 150did not have a material impact on theFirm's Consolidated financial statements.Derivative instruments and hedging activitiesIn April&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149,which amends and clarifies the accountingfor derivative instruments, includingcertain derivative instruments embedded inother contracts, and for hedgingactivities under SFAS 133. Specifically,SFAS 149 clarifies the circumstances underwhich a contract with an initial netinvestment meets the characteristics of aderivative, and when a derivative containsa financing component that warrantsspecial reporting in the Consolidatedstatement of cash flows. SFAS 149 isgenerally effective for contracts enteredinto or modified after June&nbsp;30, 2003;implementation did not have a materialeffect on the Firm's Consolidatedfinancial statements in 2003.Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activitiesIn June&nbsp;2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146,which establishes new accounting for costsassociated with exit or disposalactivities initiated after December&nbsp;31,2002. SFAS 146 requires a liability for acost associated with an exit or disposalactivity to be recorded when thatliability is incurred and can be measuredat fair value. Under the previous rules,if management approved an exit plan in onequarter, the costs of that plan generallywould have been recorded in the samequarter even if the costs were notincurred until a later quarter. Incontrast, under SFAS 146, some costs mayqualify for immediate recognition, whileother costs may be incurred over one ormore quarters. The impact of SFAS 146 willgenerally be to spread out the timing ofthe recognition of costs associated withexit or disposal activities.Impairment of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securitiesIn November&nbsp;2003, the Emerging Issues TaskForce (&#147;EITF&#148;) reached a consensus oncertain additional quantitative andqualitative disclosure requirements inconnection with its deliberations of Issue03-1, the impairment model foravailable-for-sale and held-to-maturitysecurities under SFAS 115. See Note 9 onpage 97 of this Annual Report which setsforth the disclosures now required.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report78 Table of ContentsGoodwill and other intangible assetsEffective January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Firmadopted SFAS 142 which establishes theaccounting for intangible assets (otherthan those acquired in a businesscombination). It also addresses theaccounting for goodwill and otherintangible assets subsequent to anacquisition. For a further discussion onthe adoption of SFAS 142, see Note 16 onpage 107 of this Annual Report.Accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transferIn December&nbsp;2003, the AICPA issuedStatement of Position 03-3 (&#147;SOP 03-3&#148;),Accounting for Certain Loans or DebtSecurities Acquired in a Transfer. SOP03-3 provides guidance on the accountingfor differences between contractual andexpected cash flows from the purchaser'sinitial investment in loans or debtsecurities acquired in a transfer, ifthose differences are attributable, atleast in part, to credit quality. Amongother things, SOP 03-3: (1)&nbsp;prohibits therecognition of the excess of contractualcash flows over expected cash flows as anadjustment of yield, loss accrual orvaluation allowance at the time ofpurchase; (2)&nbsp;requires that subsequentincreases in expected cash flows berecognized prospectively through anadjustment of yield; and (3)&nbsp;requires thatsubsequent decreases in expected cashflows be recognized as an impairment. Inaddition, SOP 03-3 prohibits the creationor carrying over of a valuation allowancein the initial accounting of all loanswithin its scope that are acquired in atransfer. SOP 03-3 becomes effective forloans or debt securities acquired infiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,2004.Accounting for trading derivativesIn October&nbsp;2002, the EITF concluded onIssue 02-3, which, effective January&nbsp;1,2003, precludes mark-to-market accountingfor energy-related contracts that do notmeet the definition of a derivative underSFAS 133 (i.e., transportation, storage orcapacity contracts). The Firm implementedthis provision of Issue 02-3 effectiveJanuary&nbsp;1, 2003; implementation did nothave a material effect on the Firm'sConsolidated statement of income. InNovember&nbsp;2002, as part of the discussionof Issue 02-3, the FASB staff furtherconfirmed their view that an entity shouldnot recognize profit at the inception of atrade involving a derivative financialinstrument in the absence of: (a)&nbsp;quotedmarket prices in an active market, (b)observable prices of other current markettransactions or (c)&nbsp;other observable datasupporting a valuation technique. Thisclarification did not have a materialimpact on the Firm's Consolidatedstatements of income in 2002 and 2003. TheFASB intends in 2004 to continue to focuson issues relating to the fair value offinancial instruments.Accounting for interest rate lock commitments (&#147;IRLCs&#148;)IRLCs associated with mortgages(commitments to extend credit at specifiedinterest rates) are currently accountedfor as derivative instruments inaccordance with SFAS 149. IRLCs arerecorded at fair value, with changes infair value recorded in the incomestatement.In October&nbsp;2003, the FASB added a newproject to its agenda toclarify SFAS 133, with respect to theinformation that should be used todetermine the fair value of IRLCs that areaccounted for as derivatives, and whetherloan commitments should be reported asassets by the issuer of that commitment(i.e., the lender). In December&nbsp;2003, theSEC prescribed guidance that IRLCs weredeemed to be written options from thestandpoint of the mortgage lender and, asa result, should be recorded as aliability at inception and remain aliability until the loan is funded. Thisguidance will be effective for IRLCsentered into with potential borrowersafter March&nbsp;31, 2004. This guidance willimpact the timing of revenue recognitionrelated to IRLCs. Further, the impact ofthis guidance on the Firm's currentpractice will be influenced by the volumeof new IRLCs, the volume of loan sales andthe changes in market interest ratesduring the period. The Firm is currentlyassessing the impact of this guidance onits results of operations and hedgingstrategies.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn June&nbsp;2003, the Securities and ExchangeCommission adopted final rules underSection&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002 (&#147;Section&nbsp;404&#148;). Commencing with its2004 annual report, JPMorgan Chase will berequired to include a report of managementon the Firm's internal control overfinancial reporting. The internal controlreport must include a statement ofmanagement's responsibility forestablishing and maintaining adequateinternal control over financial reportingfor the Firm; of management's assessmentof the effectiveness of the Firm'sinternal control over financial reportingas of year-end; of the framework used bymanagement to evaluate the effectivenessof the Firm's internal control overfinancial reporting; and that the Firm'sindependent accounting firm has issued anattestation report on management'sassessment of the Firm's internal controlover financial reporting, which report isalso required to be filed as part of theAnnual Report.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report79 Table of ContentsManagement's discussion and analysisJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.Comparison between 2002 and 2001JPMorgan Chase's 2002 net income was $1.7billion, relatively flat when comparedwith the prior year. Net income per diluted sharewas $0.80 in 2002, unchanged from 2001.Total revenues for 2002 of $29.6&nbsp;billionwere up by only 1% from 2001. The consumerbusinesses of the Firm contributed to thehigher revenue, benefiting primarily fromthe gradual reduction in interest rates in2002. Mortgage originations at Chase HomeFinance in high-margin sectors likeretail, wholesale, telephone-based ande-commerce reached $113&nbsp;billion, 30% abovethe level reached in 2001. Thisexceptional growth, however, was partlyoffset by the sluggishness in thewholesale businesses, primarily IB, due tothe continued slowdown in marketactivities, a reflection of the weakeconomic environment and diminishedinvestor confidence.From a business-segment point of view, therevenue results were mixed in 2002. CFSrevenue of $13.4&nbsp;billion grew by 24% over2001, reflecting high volumes across allconsumer credit businesses and significantgains in Chase Home Finance from thehedging of MSRs, partially offset by thenegative impact of lower interest rates ondeposits. TSS reported modest revenuegrowth, as strong gains in TreasuryServices and Institutional Trust Services,attributable mostly to new businesses,were offset by a decline in InvestorServices, which suffered from the lowervalue of assets held under custody. Theseincreases were offset by declines in theFirm's wholesale businesses. In IB,revenue declined 15%, driven by thereduction in capital markets and lendingrevenue, as well as in Investment bankingfees. The reduction in capital marketsrevenue was primarily attributable tolower portfolio management revenue relatedto both fixed income and equitiestransactions. IMPB's revenue in 2002declined 11% from 2001, reflecting thedepreciation in the equities market andinstitutional outflows across allasset classes. JPMP recognized privateequity losses of $733&nbsp;million in 2002,compared with losses of $1.2&nbsp;billion in2001, as a result of lower levels ofwrite-downs and write-offs, particularlyin the Technology and Telecommunicationssectors.The Firm's total noninterest expense was$22.8&nbsp;billion in 2002, down 4% from 2001,with both years incurring several largecharges. In 2002, the costs associatedwith merger and restructuring initiativeswere $1.2&nbsp;billion, versus $2.5&nbsp;billion in2001. In addition, in 2002, the Firmrecorded a $1.3&nbsp;billion charge inconnection with the settlement of itsEnron-related surety litigation and theestablishment of a reserve related tocertain material litigation, proceedingsand investigations, as well as a $98million charge for unoccupied excess realestate. Excluding the impact of thesecharges in both years, the Firm'sfull-year 2002 noninterest expense of$20.2&nbsp;billion was lower than that of 2001.Severance and related costs from expensemanagement initiatives, approximately 70%of which were in IB, added $890&nbsp;million tononinterest expense for 2002. Thesecharges were more than offset by thecontinued focus on expenses, which keptspending levels low, and by the adoptionin 2002 of SFAS 142, which eliminated theamortization of goodwill.All business segments reportedlower-to-flat noninterest expenses,except CFS, where higher business volumesresulted in expense growth. IB and IMPBreduced headcount in response to lowermarket activity levels. At TSS, tightexpense management in 2002 allowed forinvestments while keeping expense levels essentiallyflat with 2001.The Provision for credit losses increasedto $4.3&nbsp;billion in 2002, up 36% from theprior year. This was principallyattributable to troubled commercialcredits in the Telecommunications andCable sectors and the impact of theProvidian acquisition in 2002, partiallyoffset by a decrease in the consumerprovision, reflecting the effect ofcredit card securitizations.Income tax expense in 2002 was $856million, compared with $847&nbsp;million in2001. The effective tax rate was 34% in2002, versus 33% in 2001. The increase inthe effective tax rate was principallyattributable to the level of incomeearned in certain state and local taxjurisdictions in 2002.J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. / 2003 Annual Report80
