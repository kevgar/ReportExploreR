(&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;), a financial holding company incorporatedunder Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largestbanking institutions in the United States of America (&#147;U.S.&#148;), with operations worldwide. The Firmis a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and businesses, financialtransaction processing and asset management. For a discussion of the Firm's business segmentinformation, see Note 25 on pages 172-175 of this Form 10-Q.The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform toaccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;).Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelinesprescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The unaudited consolidated financial statements preparedin conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingentassets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion ofmanagement, all normal recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of thisinterim financial information. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read inconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto includedin JPMorgan Chase's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, as filed withthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;2008 Annual Report&#148;).Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.NOTE 2 &#151; BUSINESS CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS Decrease in common stock dividendOn February&nbsp;23, 2009, the Board of Directors reduced the Firm'squarterly common stock dividend from $0.38 to $0.05 per share, effective with the dividend paidon April&nbsp;30, 2009.Acquisition of the banking operations of Washington Mutual BankRefer to Note 2 on pages 123-124 and 127 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report for a discussion ofJPMorgan Chase's acquisition of the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank (&#147;WashingtonMutual&#148;) on September&nbsp;25, 2008, including its purchase price and the allocation of the purchaseprice to net assets acquired and the resulting extraordinary gain. The acquisition was accountedfor under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP for business combinations.The final total purchase price to complete the acquisition was $1.9&nbsp;billion, which was allocated tothe Washington Mutual assets acquired and liabilities assumed using their fair values as ofSeptember&nbsp;25, 2008. As the result of the final refinement of the purchase price allocation duringthe third quarter of 2009, the Firm recognized a $76 million increase in the extraordinary gain. The final summary computation of the purchase price and the allocation of the purchaseprice to the net assets of Washington Mutual are presented below.102 Table of ContentsThe following condensed statement of net assets acquired reflects the final value assigned to theWashington Mutual net assets as of September&nbsp;25, 2008.103 Table of ContentsMerger with The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.Refer to Note 2 on pages 125-127 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report for a discussion of themerger on May&nbsp;30, 2008, of a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase with The Bear StearnsCompanies Inc. (&#147;Bear Stearns&#148;). The merger was accounted for under the purchase method ofaccounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP for business combinations. The final total purchase priceto complete the merger was $1.5&nbsp;billion, which was allocated to the Bear Stearns assets acquiredand liabilities assumed using their fair values as of April&nbsp;8, 2008, and May&nbsp;30, 2008. The finalsummary computation of the purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price to the netassets of Bear Stearns are presented below.104 Table of ContentsCondensed statement of net assets acquiredThe following reflects the final value assigned to the Bear Stearns net assets as of May&nbsp;30, 2008.Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflecting the Bear Stearns merger andWashington Mutual transactionThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presents the results ofoperations of the Firm as they may have appeared for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30,2008, if the Bear Stearns merger and the Washington Mutual transaction had been completed onJanuary&nbsp;1, 2008.105 Table of ContentsThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only,and it does not indicate the financial results of the combined company had the companies actuallybeen combined as of January&nbsp;1, 2008; nor is it indicative of the results of operations in futureperiods. Included in the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the three and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, were pro forma adjustments to reflect the results of operations ofBear Stearns, and Washington Mutual's banking operations, considering the purchase accounting,valuation and accounting conformity adjustments related to each transaction. For the WashingtonMutual transaction, the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to report interest-earningsassets acquired and interest-bearing liabilities assumed at current interest rates is reflected.Valuation adjustments and the adjustment to conform allowance methodologies in the WashingtonMutual transaction, and valuation and accounting conformity adjustments related to the Bear Stearnsmerger, are reflected in the results for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008.Purchase of remaining interest in Highbridge Capital ManagementOn July&nbsp;1, 2009, JPMorgan Chase completed its purchase of the remaining interest in HighbridgeCapital Management, LLC, which resulted in a $220&nbsp;million adjustment to capital surplus.Issuance of common stockOn June&nbsp;5, 2009, the Firm issued $5.8&nbsp;billion, or 163&nbsp;million shares, of common stock. The commonstock was issued to satisfy a regulatory condition requiring the Firm to demonstrate it couldaccess the equity capital markets in order to be eligible to redeem the Series&nbsp;K preferred stockheld by the U.S. Treasury. The proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporatepurposes.Subsequent eventsThe Firm has performed an evaluation of events that have occurred subsequent to September&nbsp;30, 2009,and through November&nbsp;9, 2009 (the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q). There have been nomaterial subsequent events that occurred during such period that would require disclosure in thisForm&nbsp;10-Q, or would be required to be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of orfor the three- and nine-month periods ending September&nbsp;30, 2009.NOTE 3 &#151; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase's valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities andlending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy, see Note 4 onpages 129-143 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.During the first nine months of 2009, there were no material changes made to the Firm's valuationmodels.For a further discussion of the accounting for trading assets and liabilities, and private equityinvestments, see Note 6 on pages 146-148 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.106 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the financial instruments carried at fair value as of September&nbsp;30,2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008, by major product category and by the fair value hierarchy.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis107 Table of Contents108 Table of Contents109 Table of ContentsChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts for the three and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and 2008 (including changes in fair value), for financialinstruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When a determinationis made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on thesignificance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated toexternal sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fairvalue due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firmrisk manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities andderivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as theselevel 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in thefollowing tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to suchlevel 3 instruments.110 Table of Contents111 Table of Contents112 Table of Contents113 Table of Contents114 Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value ona nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basisbut are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there isevidence of impairment). The following tables present assets and liabilities carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheets as well as off-balance sheet instruments by caption and level withinthe fair value hierarchy (as described above) as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008, forwhich a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded during the reporting period.Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of financial instruments for which a fairvalue adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and 2008, related to financial instruments held at those dates.In the above table, loans predominantly include: (1)&nbsp;write-downs of delinquent mortgage and homeequity loans where impairment is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral; and (2)&nbsp;thechange in fair value for leveraged lending and warehouse loans carried on the balance sheet at thelower of cost or fair value. Accounts payable and other liabilities predominantly include thechange in fair value for unfunded lending-related commitments within the leveraged lendingportfolio.115 Table of ContentsLevel 3 analysisConsolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 6% of totalFirm assets at September&nbsp;30, 2009. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assetsduring the quarter.For the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009Level 3assets were $130.0&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2009,reflecting a decrease of $11.7&nbsp;billion inthe third quarter of 2009. The decline was largely due to a $9.2&nbsp;billion decrease in derivativereceivables, predominantly due to the tightening of credit spreads. In addition, mortgage servicingrights (&#147;MSRs&#148;) decreased by $937&nbsp;million due to market, interest rates and other changes affectingthe Firm's estimate of future prepayments, partially offset by sales in Retail Financial Services(&#147;RFS&#148;) of originated loans for which servicing rights were retained.For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009Level 3assets decreased by $4.6&nbsp;billion in the first nine months of 2009, due to the following:Gains and LossesIncluded in the tables for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009Included in the tables for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008Included in the tables for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009116 Table of ContentsIncluded in the tables for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008Mortgage-related exposures carried at fair valueThe following table provides a summary of the Firm's mortgage-related exposures, including theimpact of risk management activities. These exposures include all mortgage-related securities andloans carried at fair value regardless of their classification withinthe fair value hierarchy, and that are carried at fair value throughearnings or at the lower of cost or fair value; the table excludes mortgage-related securities heldin the available-for-sale portfolio, which are reported on page 118 of this Form 10-Q.117 Table of ContentsResidential mortgagesPrime mortgage &#151; Of the $4.0&nbsp;billion of prime mortgage exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2009,approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion relates to first-lien mortgages predominantly classified in level 3. Theremaining $2.2&nbsp;billion relates to securities of $1.5&nbsp;billion where $160&nbsp;million was classified inlevel 2 and $1.4&nbsp;billion was classified in level 3; and $686&nbsp;million of forward purchasecommitments, reported in derivative receivables, which were classified in level 3. Prime mortgagesecurities are largely rated BBB and below.Alt-A mortgage &#151; Of the $3.4&nbsp;billion of Alt-A mortgage exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2009,approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion relates to first-lien mortgages classified in level 3. The remaining$894&nbsp;million relates to securities, which are largely rated BB&#043; and below, where $337&nbsp;million wasclassified in level 2, and $557&nbsp;million was classified in level 3.Subprime mortgage &#151; Of the $646&nbsp;million of subprime mortgage exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2009, $445million relates to securities, predominantly rated BB&#043; and below, where $17&nbsp;million was classifiedin level 2, and $428&nbsp;million was classified in level 3. The remaining $201&nbsp;million relates tofirst-lien mortgages classified in level 3.Non-U.S. residential mortgagesOf the $1.8&nbsp;billion of non-U.S. residential mortgage exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2009, $1.0&nbsp;billionrelates to securities, largely rated &#147;AAA,&#148; where $603&nbsp;million was classified in level 2, and $443million was classified in level 3. The remaining $717&nbsp;million relates to first-lien mortgagesclassified in level 3.Commercial mortgagesOf the $5.4&nbsp;billion of commercial mortgage exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2009, $3.0&nbsp;billion relates tofirst-lien mortgages, largely in the U.S., classified in level 3. The remaining $2.4&nbsp;billionrelates to securities, which are largely rated &#147;AA&#148; and above, where $506&nbsp;million was classified inlevel 2, and $1.9&nbsp;billion was classified in level 3.The following table presents mortgage-related activities within the available-for-sale securitiesportfolio.Exposures in the table above include $235.6&nbsp;billion and $140.1&nbsp;billion of mortgage-backed andmortgage-related securities classified as available-for-sale on the Firm's Consolidated BalanceSheets at September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008. These investments are used as part of theFirm's centralized risk management of structural interest rate risk (i.e., the sensitivity of theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets to changes in interest rates). Changes in the Firm's structuralinterest rate position, as well as changes in the overall interest rate environment, arecontinually monitored, resulting in periodic repositioning of securities classified asavailable-for-sale. Given that this portfolio is primarily used to manage the Firm's structuralinterest rate risk, predominantly all of these securities are either backed by U.S. governmentagencies, backed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises or rated &#147;AAA.&#148;For additional information on investment securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, see Note11 on pages 136&#151;141 of this Form 10-Q.118 Table of ContentsCredit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuationadjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are notlimited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm's own creditworthiness. Themarket's view of the Firm's credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the creditdefault swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, seeNote 4 on pages 129&#150;143 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity,as reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respectiveperiods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments (including financialinstruments not carried at fair value)U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value ofcertain financial instruments, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate theirfair value. Financial instruments within the scope of these disclosure requirements are included inthe following table. Additionally, certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instrumentsare excluded from the scope. Accordingly, the fair value disclosures required provide only apartial estimate of the fair value of JPMorgan Chase. For example, the Firm has developed long-termrelationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts, commonlyreferred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships. In the opinion ofmanagement, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fairvalue is not disclosed in this Note.Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair valueCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheetsare carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generallynegligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks; deposits with banks,federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements; securities borrowed withshort-dated maturities; short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable; commercial paper;federal funds purchased, and securities loaned or sold, under repurchase agreements withshort-dated maturities; other borrowed funds (excluding advances from Federal Home Loan Banks);accounts payable; and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value fordeposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money marketdeposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of theseinstruments is not allowed.119 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial assets andliabilities.The majority of the Firm's unfunded lending-related commitments are not carried at fair valueon a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. Theestimated fair values of the Firm's wholesale lending-related commitments at September&nbsp;30, 2009,and December&nbsp;31, 2008, were liabilities of $1.7&nbsp;billion and $7.5&nbsp;billion, respectively. The Firmdoes not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firmcan reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower prior notice or, in some cases,without notice as permitted by law.120 Table of ContentsTrading assets and liabilities average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.NOTE 4 &#151; FAIR VALUE OPTION For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which fair value elections have beenmade, including the determination of instrument-specific credit risk for these items and the basisfor those elections, see Note 5 on pages 144&#151;146 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements ofIncome for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009 and 2008, for items for which thefair value election was made. The profit and loss information presented below only includes thefinancial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk managementinstruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.121 Table of Contents122 Table of ContentsDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balanceoutstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregateremaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31,2008, for loans and long-term debt for which the fair value option has been elected. The loans wereclassified in trading assets &#151; debt and equity instruments or in loans.NOTE 5 &#151; DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Derivative instruments enable end-users to transform or mitigate exposure to credit or marketrisks. Counterparties to a derivative contract seek to obtain risks and rewards similar to thosethat could be obtained from purchasing or selling a related cash instrument without having toexchange the full purchase or sales price upfront. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives forcustomers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage risks of market exposures. The majority ofthe Firm's derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes.Trading DerivativesThe Firm transacts in a variety of derivatives in its trading portfolios to meet the needs ofcustomers (both dealers and clients) and to generate revenue through this trading activity. TheFirm makes markets in derivatives for its customers (collectively, &#147;client derivatives&#148;), seekingto mitigate or transform interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. TheFirm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into otherderivative transactions or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially orfully offset the exposure fromclient derivatives. The Firm also seeks to earn a spread between the client derivatives andoffsetting positions, and from the remaining open risk positions. For more information abouttrading derivatives, see the trading derivatives gains and losses table on page 129 of this Form10-Q.Risk Management DerivativesThe Firm manages its market exposures using various derivative instruments.Interest rate contracts are used to minimize fluctuations in earnings that are caused by changes ininterest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value asinterest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result ofvariable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of therepayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at currentmarket rates. Gains or losses123 Table of Contentson the derivative instruments that are related to such assets andliabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability in earnings. The Firm generallyuses interest rate swaps, forwards and futures to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuationson earnings.Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated withcertain foreign currency&#151;denominated (i.e., non-U.S.) assets and liabilities and forecastedtransactions, as well as the Firm's net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or brancheswhose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreigncurrencies, the U.S. dollar&#151;equivalent values of the foreign currency&#151;denominated assets andliabilities or forecasted revenue or expense increase or decrease. Gains or losses on thederivative instruments related to these foreign currency&#151;denominated assets or liabilities, orforecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.Gold forward contracts are used to manage the price risk of gold inventory in the Firm'scommodities portfolio. Gains or losses on the gold forwards are expected to substantially offsetthe depreciation or appreciation of the inventory as a result of gold price changes. Also in thecommodities portfolio, electricity and natural gas futures and forwards contracts are used tomanage price risk associated with energy-related tolling and load-serving contracts andinvestments.The Firm uses credit derivatives to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans andlending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referencedin the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligationwhen due. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see the discussion in the Creditderivatives section on pages 130&#150;131 of this Form 10-Q.For more information about risk management derivatives, see the risk management derivatives gainsand losses table on page 129 of this Form 10-Q.Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008.124 Table of ContentsWhile the notional amounts disclosed above indicate the volume of the Firm's derivativeactivity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possible losses thatcould arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount does notchange hands; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.Accounting for DerivativesAll free-standing derivatives are required to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets atfair value. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not thecontract has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are notdesignated as hedges are marked to market through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages126&#150;131 of this Form 10-Q provide additional information on the amount of and reporting forderivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. For further discussion of derivatives embedded instructured notes, see Notes 4 and 5 on pages 129&#150;143 and 144&#150;146, respectively, of JPMorganChase's 2008 Annual Report.Derivatives designated as hedgesThe Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes &#151;typically interest rate, foreign exchange and gold derivatives, as described above. JPMorgan Chasedoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the Firm's risk management activities involvingderivatives. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased credit defaultswaps used to manage the credit risk of loans and commitments, because of the difficulties inqualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accountingto certain interest rate derivatives used for risk management purposes, or to commodity derivativesused to manage the price risk of tolling and load-serving contracts.To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the riskassociated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as ahedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation mustidentify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability and type of risk to be hedged,and how the effectiveness of the derivative will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. Toassess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, as well asnonstatistical methodsincluding dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the changein the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The extent to which a derivative has been, andis expected to continue to be, effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows ofthe hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. Any hedge ineffectiveness(i.e., the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does notexactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk) must bereported in current-period earnings. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effectiveat hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and netinvestment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-termdebt, available-for-sale (&#147;AFS&#148;) securities and gold inventory. For qualifying fair value hedges,the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the riskbeing hedged, are recognized in earnings. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the fairvalue adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedgeditem and is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment.JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows fromfloating-rate financial instruments and forecasted transactions, primarily the rollover ofshort-term assets and liabilities, and foreign currency&#151;denominated revenue and expense. Forqualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of thederivative is recorded in other comprehensive income/(loss) (&#147;OCI&#148;) and recognized in theConsolidated Statements of Income when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. Derivative amountsaffecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item &#151;primarily interest income, interest expense, noninterest revenue and compensation expense. Theineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. If the hedgerelationship is terminated, then the value of the derivative recorded in accumulated othercomprehensive income/(loss) (&#147;AOCI&#148;) is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedgedaffect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction isnot expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative valuesrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.JPMorgan Chase uses foreign currency hedges to protect the value of the Firm's net investments incertain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Forqualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in thetranslation adjustments account within AOCI.125 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative fair values that are reflected on theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, by accounting designation (e.g.,whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.Free-standing derivatives(a)Derivative receivables and payables mark-to-marketThe following table summarizes the fair values of derivative receivables and payables by contracttype after netting adjustments as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008.126 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives and hedged items on the income statement and on other comprehensiveincomeThe following table summarizes the total pretax impact of JPMorgan Chase's derivative-relatedactivities on the Firm's Consolidated Statements of Income and Other Comprehensive Income for thethree and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009, by accounting designation.The tables that follow reflect more detailed information regarding the derivative-relatedincome statement impact by accounting designation for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30,2009.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedgeaccounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and therelated hedged items for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009. The Firm includesgains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in theConsolidated Statements of Income.127 Table of ContentsCash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedgeaccounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the threeand nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedgingderivative in the same line item as the offsetting change in cash flows on the hedged item in theConsolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, the Firm expects that $119&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin AOCI at September&nbsp;30, 2009, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. Themaximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and suchtransactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in netinvestment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on suchderivatives for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009.128 Table of ContentsRisk management derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedging instruments)The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated inhedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the three andnine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009. These derivatives are risk management instruments used tomitigate or transform the risk of market exposures arising from banking activities other thantrading activities, which are discussed separately below.Trading derivative gains and lossesThe Firm has elected to present derivative gains and losses related to its trading activitiestogether with the cash instruments with which they are risk managed. All amounts are recorded inprincipal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2009.Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresIn addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivativesexpose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk &#151; the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meettheir payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by theFirm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. The amount of derivativereceivables reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is the fair value of the derivativecontracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateralheld by the Firm. These amounts represent the cost to the Firm to replace the contracts atthen-current market rates should the counterparty default. However, in management's view, theappropriate measure of current credit risk should take into consideration other, additional liquidsecurities held as collateral by the Firm, which is disclosed in the table below.While derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm toliquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securitiescollateral with counterparties as the mark-to-market (&#147;MTM&#148;) moves in the counterparties' favor, orupon specified downgrades in the Firm's and its subsidiaries' respective credit ratings. AtSeptember&nbsp;30, 2009, the impact of a single-notch and six-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase& Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., would have required $1.5&nbsp;billionand $4.4&nbsp;billion, respectively, of additional collateral to be posted by the Firm. Certainderivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade ofeither the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. At September30, 2009, the impact of single-notch and six-notch ratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase & Co. andits subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., related to contracts with terminationtriggers would have required the Firm to settle trades with a fair value of $0.3&nbsp;million and $5.2billion, respectively. The aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingentcollateral or termination features triggered upon a downgrade was $25.9&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2009, for which the Firm has posted collateral of $24.2&nbsp;billion in the normal course of business.129 Table of ContentsThe following table shows the current credit risk of derivative receivables after nettingadjustments and collateral received, and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables afternetting adjustments and collateral posted, as of September&nbsp;30, 2009.In addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the table above, the Firm receives anddelivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions, which is available as securityagainst potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in theFirm's or client's favor, respectively. The Firm and its counterparties also hold collateralrelated to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted, andcollateral that the Firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of thereporting date. At September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Firm received $18.3&nbsp;billion and delivered $6.0&nbsp;billionof such additional collateral. These amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables andpayables in the table above, because, at an individual counterparty level, the collateral exceededthe fair value exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2009.Credit derivativesCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associatedwith the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (theprotection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Creditderivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, asthe protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entityexperiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or arestructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but hasthe risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a creditevent.The Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and usesthese derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker in thedealer/client business, the Firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives bypurchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet theneeds of customers. As a seller of protection, the Firm's exposure to a given reference entity maybe offset partially, or entirely, with a contract to purchase protection from another counterpartyon the same or similar reference entity. Second, the Firm uses credit derivatives to mitigatecredit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial creditlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) as well as to manage its exposure to residentialand commercial mortgages.For a further discussion of credit derivatives, including a description of the different types usedby the Firm, see Note 32 on pages 202&#150;205 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.The following table presents a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008.Upon a credit event, the Firm as seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage ofthe full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on thecontracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time ofsettlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasingprotection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. As such, other purchasedprotection referenced in the following table includes credit derivatives bought on related, but notidentical, reference positions; these include indices, portfolio coverage and other referencepoints. The Firm does not use notional amounts as the primary measure of risk management for creditderivatives, because notional does not take into account the probability of occurrence of a creditevent, recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges.130 Table of ContentsTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notes&nbsp;The following table summarizes the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008, where JPMorgan Chase is theseller of protection.

Trading securities are discussed in Note 3 on pages106&#150;121 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and credit losses that were recognizedin income from AFS securities.&nbsp;The amortized costs and estimated fair values of AFS and HTM securities were as follows forthe dates indicated.&nbsp;136 Table of ContentsSecurities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for AFS securities by agingcategory at September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008.&nbsp;137 Table of ContentsOther-than-temporary impairmentIn April&nbsp;2009, the FASB amended the other-than-temporary impairment (&#147;OTTI&#148;) model for debtsecurities. The impairment model for equity securities was not affected. Under the new guidance,OTTI loss must be recognized in earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt security,or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt securitybefore recovery of its amortized cost basis. However, even if an investor does not expect to sell adebt security, it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit lossexists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the creditloss is recognized in income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded inOCI. The guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of credit losses,as well as factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an investment is notother-than-temporarily impaired. JPMorgan Chase early adopted the new guidance effective for theperiod ending March&nbsp;31, 2009. The Firm did not record a transition adjustment for securities heldat March&nbsp;31, 2009, which were previously considered other-than-temporarily impaired, as the Firmintended to sell the securities for which it had previously recognizedother-than-temporary impairments.AFS securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed as part of the Firm's ongoing assessmentof OTTI. When the Firm intends to sell AFS securities, it recognizes an impairment loss equal tothe full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of those securities.When the Firm does not intend to sell AFS equity or debt securities in an unrealized loss position,potential OTTI is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent towhich the market value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to theindustry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of asecurity; payment structure of the security; changes to the rating of the security by a ratingagency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security afterthe balance sheet date. For debt securities, the Firm estimates cash flows over the remaining livesof the underlying collateral to assess whether credit losses exist and, where applicable forpurchased or retained beneficial interests in securitized assets, to determine if any adversechanges in cash flows have occurred. The Firm's cash flow estimates take into account expectationsof relevant market and economic data as of the end of the reporting period &#151; including, forexample, for securities issued in a securitization, underlying loan-level data, and structuralfeatures of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization orother forms of credit enhancement. The Firm compares the losses projected for the underlyingcollateral (&#147;pool losses&#148;) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structureto determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a creditloss on the AFS debt security exists. The Firm also performs other analyses to support its cashflow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios. For debt securities, the Firmconsiders a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary when the Firm does not expect torecover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Firm also considers an OTTI to haveoccurred when there is an adverse change in cash flows to beneficial interests in securitizationsthat are rated below &#147;AA&#148; at acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settledin such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment. Forequity securities, the Firm considers the above factors, as well as the Firm's intent and abilityto retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery inmarket value, and whether evidence exists to support a realizable value equal to or greater thanthe carrying value. The Firm considers a decline in fair value of AFS equity securities to beother-than-temporary if it is probable that the Firm will not recover its amortized cost basis.The following table presents credit losses that are included in the securities gains and lossestable above.&nbsp;138 Table of ContentsChanges in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that wererecognized in income during the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009, related to debtsecurities that the Firm does not intend to sell.During 2009, the Firm continued to increase the size of its AFS securities portfolio. Overall, unrealized losses have decreased since December31, 2008, due primarily to overall market spread and market liquidity, which resulted in increasedpricing across asset classes. As of September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Firm does not intend to sell thesecurities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required tosell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for thesecurities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, theFirm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarilyimpaired as of September&nbsp;30, 2009.Following is a description of the Firm's main security investments and the key assumptions used inits estimate of the present value of the cash flows most likely to be collected from theseinvestments.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; U.S. government agenciesAs of September&nbsp;30, 2009, gross unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities related to U.S.agencies were $144&nbsp;million, of which $17&nbsp;million related to securities that have been in anunrealized loss position for longer than 12&nbsp;months. These mortgage-backed securities do not haveany credit losses, given the explicit and implicit guarantees provided by the U.S. federalgovernment.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; Prime and Alt-A non-agencyAs of September&nbsp;30, 2009, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residentialmortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers were $1.2&nbsp;billion, of which $1.1&nbsp;billionrelated to securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for longer than 12&nbsp;months.Overall losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2008, due to increased market stabilization,resulting from increased demand for higher-yielding asset classes and new U.S. government programs.Approximately one-third of these positions are currently rated &#147;AAA.&#148; Approximately half of theamortized cost of the investments in prime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities have experienceddowngrades, and approximately one-third of the amortized cost of investments in prime and Alt-Amortgage-backed securities are currently rated below investment-grade. Despite the downgradesexperienced, the portfolio generally continues to possess credit enhancement levels sufficient tosupport the Firm's investment. However, the Firm has recognized $84&nbsp;million of OTTI losses inearnings for securities that have experienced increased delinquency rates associated with specificcollateral types and origination dates. In analyzing prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backedsecurities for potential credit losses, the key inputs to the Firm's cash flow projections wereestimated peak-to-trough home price declines of up to 40% and an unemployment rate of 10%. TheFirm's cash flow projections assumed liquidation rates of 75% to 100% and loss severities of 45% to55%, depending on the underlying collateral type and seasoning.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; SubprimeAs of September&nbsp;30, 2009, there were no gross unrealized losses related to subprime residentialmortgage-backed securities (&#147;RMBS&#148;) in an unrealized loss position. During the three and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Firm recorded losses of zero and $7&nbsp;million, respectively, onsubprime RMBS based on the Firm's intent to sell such securities. In addition, the Firm realized again of $1&nbsp;million and a loss of $27&nbsp;million, respectively, on sales of subprime RMBS during thethree and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009.139 Table of ContentsMortgage-backed securities &#151; CommercialAs of September&nbsp;30, 2009, gross unrealized losses related to commercial mortgage-backed securitieswere $77&nbsp;million, of which $73&nbsp;million related to securities that have been in an unrealized lossposition for longer than 12&nbsp;months. The Firm's commercial mortgage-backedsecurities are rated &#147;AAA,&#148; &#147;AA,&#148; &#147;A&#148; and &#147;BBB&#148; and possess, on average, 28% subordination (a formof credit enhancement for the benefit of senior securities, expressed here as the percentage ofpool losses that can occur before a senior asset-backed security will incur its first dollar ofprincipal loss). In considering whether potential credit-related losses exist, the Firm conducted ascenario analysis, using high levels of delinquencies and losses over the near term, followed bylower levels over the long term. Specific assumptions included: (i)&nbsp;default of all loans more than60&nbsp;days delinquent; (ii)&nbsp;additional default rates for the remaining portfolio forecasted to be upto 8% in the near term and 2% in the long term; and (iii)&nbsp;loss severity assumptions ranging from45% in the near term to 40% in later years.Asset-backed securities &#151; Credit card receivablesAs of September&nbsp;30, 2009, gross unrealized losses related to credit card receivables asset-backedsecurities were $77&nbsp;million, of which $76&nbsp;million of the losses related to securities that were inan unrealized loss position for longer than 12&nbsp;months. Of the $77&nbsp;million of unrealized lossesrelated to credit card&#151;related asset-backed securities, $68&nbsp;million relates to purchased creditcard&#151;related asset-backed securities, and $9&nbsp;million related to retained interests in the Firm'sown credit card receivable securitizations. The credit card&#151;related asset-backed securitiesinclude &#147;AAA,&#148; &#147;AA,&#148; &#147;A&#148; and &#147;BBB&#148; ratings. One of the key metrics the Firm reviews for creditcard&#151;related asset-backed securities is each trust's excess spread &#151; which is the creditenhancement resulting from cash that remains each month after payments are made to investors forprincipal and interest and to servicers for servicing fees, and after credit losses are allocated.The average excess spread for the issuing trusts in which the Firm holds interests ranges from 3%to 9%. The Firm uses internal models to project the cash flows that affect excess spread. Forretained interests, the Firm uses its own underlying loan data as well as available marketbenchmarks. For purchased investments, the Firm uses available market benchmarks and trends tosupport the assumptions used in the projections. In analyzing potential credit losses, the primaryassumptions are underlying charge-off rates, ranging from 8% to 16% (charge-off rates considerunderlying assumptions such as unemployment rates and roll rates), payment rates of 11% to 23%, andportfolio yields of 16% to 26%.Asset-backed securities &#151; Collateralized debt and loan obligationsAs of September&nbsp;30, 2009, gross unrealized losses related to collateralized debt and loanobligations were $529&nbsp;million, of which $514&nbsp;million related to securities that were in anunrealized loss position for longer than 12&nbsp;months. Overall losses have decreased since December31, 2008, mainly as a result of an increase in high-yield markets, lower default forecasts andspread tightening across various asset classes. Substantially all of these securities are rated&#147;AAA&#148; and &#147;AA&#148; and have an average of 28% credit enhancement. Credit enhancement in collateralizedloan obligations (&#147;CLOs&#148;) is mainly composed of overcollateralization &#151; the excess of the paramount of collateral over the par amount of securities. The key assumptions considered in analyzingpotential credit losses were underlying loan and debt security defaults and loss severity. Based oncurrent default trends, the Firm assumed collateral default rates of 12% for three months, 6% forthe next 24&nbsp;months and 4% thereafter. Further, loss severities were assumed to be 50% for loans and80% for debt securities. Losses on collateral were estimated to occur approximately 24&nbsp;months afterdefault.140 Table of ContentsContractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2009, ofJPMorgan Chase's AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.&nbsp;141 Table of ContentsNOTE 12 &#151; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 onpages 162&#150;163 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report. For further information regarding securitiesborrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, seeNote 4 on pages 121&#150;123 of this Form 10-Q.The following table details the components of collateralized financings.&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchaseagreements and other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by thesecured party are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.At September&nbsp;30, 2009, the Firm received securities as collateral that could be repledged,delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of approximately $631.1&nbsp;billion. This collateral wasgenerally obtained under resale or securities-borrowing agreements. Of these securities,approximately $496.1&nbsp;billion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used, generally as collateralunder repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales.NOTE 13 &#151; LOANS The accounting for a loan is based on whether it is originated or purchased, and whether the loanis used in an investing or trading strategy. The measurement framework for loans in theConsolidated Financial Statements is one of the following:For adetailed discussion of accounting policies relating to loans, see Note 14 on pages 163&#150;166of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages121&#150;123 of this Form 10-Q for furtherinformation on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note3 on pages 106&#150;121 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value andclassified as trading assets.142 Table of ContentsThe composition of the Firm's aggregate loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was asfollows.&nbsp;143 Table of ContentsThe following table reflects information about the Firm's loan sales.&nbsp;Purchased credit-impaired loansIn connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans that itdeemed to be credit-impaired. For a detailed discussion of purchased credit-impaired loans,including accounting policies, see Note 14 on pages 163&#150;166 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 AnnualReport.Purchased credit-impaired loans are reported in loans on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.During the third quarter of 2009, an allowance for loan losses of $1.1&nbsp;billion was recorded fornon-option ARM prime mortgage pool loans. This allowance for loan losses is reported as a reductionof the carrying amount of the loans in the table below. The outstanding balance and the carryingamount of the purchased credit-impaired consumer loans were as follows.&nbsp;The accretable yield represents the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over thefair value of the purchased credit-impaired loans. This amount is not reported on the Firm'sConsolidated Balance Sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over theexpected lives of the underlying loans. For variable rate loans, expected future cash flows wereinitially based on the rate in effect at acquisition; expected future cash flows are recalculatedas rates change over the lives of the loans.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for purchased credit-impaired consumerloans for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2009.Accretable yield activity&nbsp;Other impaired loansImpaired loans predominantly include wholesale nonaccrual loans and all loans, other than purchasedcredit-impaired loans, restructured in troubled debt restructurings. A loan with an insignificantdelay or an insignificant shortfall in the amount of payments expected to be collected is notconsidered to be impaired, particularly if the Firm expects to collect all amounts due, includinginterest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period ofdelay. Troubled debtrestructurings may be returned to accrual status if certain criteria are met; however, such loansmust continue to be reported as impaired loans, unless the loan was restructured at a then-currentmarket rate of interest. For additional detailed discussion of impaired loans, including types ofimpaired loans, certain troubled debt restructurings and accounting policies relating to theinterest income on these loans, see Note 14 on pages 163&#150;166 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 AnnualReport.144 Table of ContentsThe tables below set forth information about JPMorgan Chase's impaired loans, excluding creditcard loans, which are discussed below. The Firm primarily uses the discounted cash flow method forvaluing impaired loans.&nbsp;Included in the table above are consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, that have beenmodified in a troubled debt restructuring, with balances of approximately $3.0&nbsp;billion and $1.8billion as of September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively. Of the consumer loansmodified in troubled debt restructurings, $734&nbsp;million and $853&nbsp;million were classified asnonperforming at September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008, respectively. As of September&nbsp;30, 2009,wholesale loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings were approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion. For adetailed discussion of the modification of the terms of credit card loan agreements, see Note 14 onpages 163&#150;166 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report. At September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31,2008, the Firm modified $4.6&nbsp;billion and $2.4&nbsp;billion,respectively, of on&#150;balance sheet creditcard loans outstanding.During 2009, the Firm reviewed its real estate portfolio to identify homeownersmost in need of assistance, opened new regional counseling centers, hired additional loancounselors, introduced new financing alternatives, proactively reached out to borrowers to offerprequalified modifications, and commenced a new process to independently review each loan beforemoving it into the foreclosure process. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, the U.S.Treasury introduced the Making Home Affordable (&#147;MHA&#148;)programs, which are designed toassist eligible homeowners by modifying the terms of their mortgages. The Firm is participating inthe MHA programs while continuing to expand its other loss-mitigation efforts for financiallydistressed borrowers who do not qualify for the MHA programs. The MHA programs and the Firm's otherloss-mitigation programs for financially troubled borrowers generally represent variousconcessions such as term extensions, rate reductions and deferral ofprincipal payments that would have been requiredunder the terms of the original agreement. Under these programs, borrowers must make three payments during a90-day trial modification period and be successfully re-underwritten with income verificationbefore their loan could be contractually modified. Upon contractual modification, retained loans areaccounted for as troubled debt restructurings. For purchased credit-impaired loans, the impact ofthe modification is incorporated into the Firm's quarterly assessment of whether a probable and/orsignificant change in estimated future cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to beaccounted for and reported as purchased credit-impaired loans.145 Table of ContentsNOTE 14 &#151; ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and a formula-based component.The asset-specific component relates to risk-rated loans considered to be impaired and all loansrestructured in troubled debt restructurings (except for certain purchased credit-impaired loans).An allowance is established when the loan's discounted cash flows (or collateral value orobservable market price) are lower than its carrying value. To compute the asset-specific componentof the allowance, larger loans are evaluated individually, while smaller loans are evaluated aspools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. Risk-ratedloans (primarily wholesale loans) arepooled by risk rating, while scored loans (i.e., consumer loans) are pooled by product type. An allowance for loan losseswill also be recorded for purchased credit-impaired loans if there are probable credit-relateddecreases in expected future cash flows. Any required allowance would be measured based on thepresent value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's (or pool's) effective interest rate.The formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation and covers performing wholesaleloans and consumer loans, except for loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings andpurchased credit-impaired loans. For risk-rated loans, the statisticalcalculation is the product of an estimated probability of default (&#147;PD&#148;) and an estimated lossgiven default (&#147;LGD&#148;). These factors are differentiated by risk rating and expected maturity. Inassessing the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the obligor's debtcapacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor's earnings, the amount and sources forrepayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry andgeography in which the obligor operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical andcurrent information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Emphasizing one factorover another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned by the Firm tothat loan. PD estimates are based on observable external data, primarily credit-rating agencydefault statistics. LGD estimates are based on a study of actual credit losses over more than onecredit cycle.For scored loans, the statistical calculation is performed on pools of loanswith similar risk characteristics (e.g., product type) and generally computed as the product ofactual outstandings, an expected-loss factor and an estimated-loss coverage period. Expected-lossfactors are statistically derived and consider historical factors such as loss frequency andseverity. In developing loss frequency and severity assumptions, the Firm considers known andanticipated changes in the economic environment, including changes in housing prices, unemploymentrates and other risk indicators. A nationally recognized home price index measure is used todevelop loss severity estimates on defaulted home loans at the MSA level. These loss severityestimates are regularly validated by actual losses recognized on defaulted loans, market-specificreal estate appraisals and property sales activity. Real estate appraisals are updated when theloan is charged-off, annually thereafter, and at the time of the final foreclosure sale.Forecasting methods are used to estimate expected-loss factors, including credit loss forecastingmodels and vintage-based loss forecasting.Management applies judgment within an established framework to adjust the results of applying thestatistical calculation described above. Where adjustments are made to the statistical calculationfor the risk-rated portfolios, the determination of the appropriate point within the range is basedon management's quantitative and qualitative assessment of the quality of underwriting standards;relevant internal factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio; and externalfactors, such as current macroeconomic and political conditions that have occurred but are not yetreflected in the loss factors. Factors related to unemployment, housing prices, and bothconcentrated and deteriorating industries are also incorporated into the calculation, whererelevant. Adjustments to the statistical calculation for the scored loan portfolios areaccomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment.The specific ranges and the determination of the appropriate point within the range are based onmanagement's view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic and political conditions,the quality of underwriting standards, and other relevant internal and external factors affectingthe credit quality of the portfolio.Management establishes an asset-specific allowance for lending-related commitments that areconsidered impaired and computes a formula-based allowance for performing wholesale lending-relatedcommitments. These are computed using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loanportfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown.For further discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, seeNote 15 on pages 166&#151;168 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.146 Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for loan losses.&nbsp;The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for lending-related commitments.NOTE15 &#151; LOAN SECURITIZATIONS For a discussion of the accounting policies relating to loan securitizations, see Note 16 on pages168&#150;176 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report. JPMorgan Chase securitizes and sells a variety ofloans, including residential mortgage, credit card, automobile, student, and commercial (primarilyrelated to real estate) loans. JPMorgan Chase&#151;sponsored securitizations use special-purposeentities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) as part of the securitization process. These SPEs are structured to meet thedefinition of a qualifying special-purpose entity (&#147;QSPE&#148;) (for a further discussion, see Note 1 onpage 122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report); accordingly, the assets and liabilities ofsecuritization-related QSPEs are not reflected on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets (exceptfor retained interests, as described below). The primary purposes of these securitization vehiclesare to meet investor needs and to generate liquidity for the Firm through the sale of loans to theQSPEs, which are financed through the issuance of fixed- or floating-rate asset-backed securities.147 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in JPMorganChase&#151;sponsored securitization entities, for which sale accounting was achieved and to which theFirm has continuing involvement, at September&nbsp;30, 2009, and December&nbsp;31, 2008. Continuinginvolvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior or subordinated interests, recourse orguarantee arrangements, and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm's onlycontinuing involvement is servicing the loans.&nbsp;148 Table of ContentsSecuritization activity by major product typeThe following discussion describes the nature of the Firm's securitization activities by majorproduct type.Credit card securitizationsOverviewThe Card Services (&#147;CS&#148;) business securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans, primarilythrough the Chase Issuance Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;). The Firm's primary continuing involvement aftersecuritization includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller's interest in thereceivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.CS maintains servicing responsibilities for all credit card securitizations that it sponsors. Asservicer and transferor, the Firm receives contractual servicing fees based on the securitized loanbalance plus excess servicing fees, which are recorded in credit card income as discussed in Note 6on page 132 of this Form 10-Q. The Firm acquired the seller's interest in the Washington MutualMaster Trust (the &#147;WMM Trust&#148;) and became its sponsor in connection with the Washington Mutualtransaction. For further discussion of credit card securitizations,see Note 16 on pages 169&#150;170of JPMorgan Chase's 2008 Annual Report.Actions taken in the second quarter of 2009During the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2009, the overall performance of the Firm's credit cardsecuritization trusts declined, primarily due to the increase in credit losses incurred on theunderlying credit card receivables.Trust: The Chase Issuance Trust (the Firm's primary issuance trust), which holds prime qualitycredit card receivables, maintained positive excess spread, a key metric for evaluating theperformance of a card trust, through the first nine months of 2009. However, given marketuncertainty concerning projected credit costs in the credit card industry, and to mitigate anyfurther deterioration in the performance of the Trust, the Firm took certain actions, as permittedby the Trust agreements, to enhance the performance of the Trust. On May&nbsp;12, 2009, the Firmincreased the required credit enhancement level for each tranche of outstanding notes issued by theTrust, by increasing the minimum required amount of subordinated notes and the funding requirementsfor the Trust's cash escrow accounts. On June&nbsp;1, 2009, the Firm began designating as &#147;discountreceivables&#148; a percentage of new credit card receivables for inclusion in the Trust, therebyrequiring collections of such discounted receivables to be applied as finance charge collections inthe Trust, which is expected to increase the excess spread for the Trust. The Firm expects todiscontinue designating a percentage of new receivables as discount receivables on July&nbsp;1, 2010.Also, during the second quarter of 2009, the Firm exchanged $3.5&nbsp;billion of its undivided seller'sinterest in the Trust for $3.5&nbsp;billion of zero-coupon subordinated securities issued by the Trustand retained by the Firm. The issuance of the zero-coupon securities by the Trust is also expectedto increase the excess spread for the Trust. These actions resulted in the addition ofapproximately $40&nbsp;billion of risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes, which decreasedthe Firm's Tier 1 capital ratio by approximately 40 basis points, but did not have a materialimpact on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets or results of operations.WMM Trust: At the time of the acquisition of the Washington Mutual banking operations, the assetsof the WMM Trust comprised Washington Mutual subprime credit card receivables. The quality of theassets in the WMM Trust was much lower than the quality of the credit card receivables thatJPMorgan Chase has historically securitized in the public markets.In order to more closely conform the WMM Trust to the overall quality typical of a JPMorganChase&#151;sponsored credit card securitization master trust, during the fourth quarter of 2008 theFirm randomly removed $6.2&nbsp;billion of credit card loans held by the WMM Trust and replaced themwith $5.8&nbsp;billion of higher-quality receivables from the Firm's portfolio.However, as a result of continued deterioration during 2009 in the credit quality of the remainingWashington Mutual&#151;originated assets in the WMM Trust, the performance of the portfolio indicatedthat an early amortization event was likely to occur unless additional actions were taken. On May15, 2009, JPMorgan Chase, as seller and servicer, and the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee,amended the pooling and servicing agreement to permit non-random removals of credit card accounts.On May&nbsp;19, 2009, the Firm removed all remaining credit card receivables originated by WashingtonMutual. Following this removal, the WMM Trust collateral was entirely composed of receivablesoriginated by JPMorgan Chase. As a result of the actions taken by the Firm, the assets andliabilities of the WMM Trust were consolidated on the balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase. As a result,the Firm has recorded, during the second quarter of 2009, additional assets with an initial fairvalue of $6.0&nbsp;billion additional liabilities with an initial fair value of $6.1&nbsp;billion and apretax loss of approximately $64&nbsp;million.Retained interests in nonconsolidated credit card securitizationsThe following is a description of the Firm's retained interests in credit card securitizations thatwere not consolidated at the dates presented. Accordingly, the Firm's retained interests in the WMMTrust are included in the amounts reported at December&nbsp;31, 2008, but no longer included atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2009, due to the second quarter actions noted above. For further informationregarding the WMM Trust assets and liabilities, see Note 16 on pages 156&#151;161 of this Form 10-Q.149
