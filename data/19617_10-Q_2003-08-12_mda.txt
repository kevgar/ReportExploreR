&nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEW&nbsp;Financial Highlights &#151; Reported Basis: Reported net income for J.P. MorganChase & Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;) was$1.8&nbsp;billion, or $0.89 per share, in the second quarter of 2003, compared withnet income of $1.4&nbsp;billion, or $0.69 per share, in the first quarter of 2003,and net income of $1.0&nbsp;billion, or $0.50 per share, in the second quarter of2002. For the first six months of 2003, reported net income was $3.2&nbsp;billion,or $1.57 per share, compared with $2.0&nbsp;billion, or $0.99 per share, in the sameperiod last year.Total revenue of $9.0&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2003 was 7% higher thanin the 2003 first quarter and 19% higher than in the second quarter of 2002.The increase, when compared with the first quarter of this year, was driven byrecord revenues at Chase Financial Services, particularly at Chase HomeFinance, and higher revenues at the Investment Bank, reflecting strong fixedincome results and increased investment banking fees. For the first half of2003, total revenue of $17.4&nbsp;billion was 15% higher than in the same periodlast year.Total noninterest expense was $5.8&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2003, 5%higher than in the 2003 first quarter and 12% over the second quarter of 2002,driven by a $100&nbsp;million addition to the previously-established litigationreserve relating to Enron, higher performance-related incentive accruals andincreased severance and related costs, including a $128&nbsp;million charge forvacant excess real estate. On a year-to-date basis, total expense of $11.4billion in 2003 was 8% higher than last year.The provision for credit losses for the 2003 second quarter of $435&nbsp;million wasdown 41% compared with the 2003 first quarter and down 47% compared with the2002 second quarter. The provision this quarter was less than total netcharge-offs of $614&nbsp;million, reflecting continued improvement in the quality ofthe commercial loan portfolio. Fewer new problem credits were added thisquarter; commercial nonperforming assets and criticized exposure levelsdeclined 9% and 12%, respectively, from March&nbsp;31, 2003. Consumer credit qualityremained stable.Summary of Segment Results: In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on areported basis, management utilizes &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of itsbusiness segments. &#147;Operating basis&#148; excludes the impact of merger andrestructuring costs and special items. In the first and second quarters of2003, there was no difference between reported results and results on anoperating basis, as there were no special items in 2003 and all restructuringcosts are now included within reported results. On an operating basis, earningswere $1.8&nbsp;billion, or $0.89 per share, in the second quarter of 2003 comparedwith $1.4&nbsp;billion, or $0.69 per share, in the first quarter of2003 and $1.2&nbsp;billion, or $0.58 per share, in the second quarter of 2002. For the six monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2003, earnings on an operating basis were $3.2&nbsp;billion, or $1.57per share, versus $2.3&nbsp;billion, or $1.15 per share, for the six months endedJune&nbsp;30, 2002. For additional information and a reconciliation between theFirm's reported and operating results, see pages 32-34 of this Form 10-Q.Segment results this quarter reflect the revised internal management reportingpolicies relating to allocating economic risk capital and other items describedin detail in Capital Management on pages 49-50, and Support Units andCorporate on pages 48-49 of this Form 10-Q, and in the Firm's Form 8-K dated July&nbsp;11, 2003. Allprior periods have been restated.25 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Total assets as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, were $803&nbsp;billion, compared with $759&nbsp;billionas of December&nbsp;31, 2002, and $741&nbsp;billion atJune&nbsp;30, 2002. JPMorgan Chase's Tier 1 Capital ratio was 8.7% at June&nbsp;30, 2003,compared with 8.2% at December&nbsp;31, 2002, and 8.8% at June&nbsp;30, 2002.Enron Settlement: On July&nbsp;28, 2003, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced that ithad entered into agreements with the Securities and Exchange Commission(&#147;SEC&#148;), the Office of the District Attorney for New York County, the FederalReserve Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department resolvingmatters relating to its involvement with commodity prepay transactionsinvolving Enron Corporation and its affiliates. In connection with the SECsettlement, the SEC alleged that the Firm aided and abetted a securities fraudby Enron. JPMorgan Chase neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations, butconsented to the order sought by the SEC enjoining the company from futureviolations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and requiring itto pay a total of $135&nbsp;million, consisting of $65&nbsp;million of disgorgement ofrevenues, $5&nbsp;million of interest, and $65&nbsp;million of penalties. The agreementwith the District Attorney's Office provided that neither JPMorgan Chase norany of its officers or employees will be prosecuted by the District Attorney'sOffice, and that the Firm will pay a total of $27.5&nbsp;million, consisting of26 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)$25&nbsp;million in penalties and $2.5&nbsp;million in reimbursement of expenses of theDistrict Attorney's Office. The Firm has also committed to take certainmeasures to improve its handling of structured finance transactions. Theagreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York StateBanking Department, a formal written agreement, requires JPMorgan Chase toadopt programs acceptable to the Federal Reserve and the Banking Department forenhancing the Firm's management of credit risk and legal and reputational risk,particularly in relation to its participation in structured financetransactions.As noted above, in the second quarter of 2003, JPMorgan Chase added $100million to its Enron litigation reserve to reflect the cost of the settlements.No additional charge was taken in connection with these settlements.Business Outlook: Results for the first half of the year were driven by strongtrading revenues in the Investment Bank and record mortgage originations atChase Home Finance. In addition, credit quality improved: criticized commercialexposure declined by 23% over the past six months, nonperforming commercialassets were 18% lower than at December&nbsp;31, 2002, and consumer charge-off ratiosimproved across almost all consumer products when compared with the secondquarter of 2002. Over the remainder of the year, the Firm expects commercialcredit quality to improve, and consumer credit quality to remain stable. TheFirm anticipates lower earnings per share in the second half of 2003, primarilythe result of moderating trading, treasury and mortgage business revenues in arising interest rate environment.&nbsp;RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&nbsp;The following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations on a reported basis.&nbsp;Investment banking feesThe table below provides the components of Investment banking fees:&nbsp;Investment banking fees were $779&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003, $616million in the first quarter of 2003 and $785&nbsp;million in the second quarter of2002. For the first six months of 2003, investment banking fees of $1.4&nbsp;billionwere down 9% from the same period last year. See the Investment Bank segmentfor a discussion of investment banking fees on pages 36-38 of this Form 10-Q.Trading revenueThe table below provides the components of Trading revenue:&nbsp;27 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Trading revenue of $1.5&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2003 represented thehighest trading results since the first quarter of 2001. The increase from thefirst quarter of 2003 reflected strong growth in fixed income, interest ratederivatives and foreign exchange trading. The results reflected higher clientactivity and strong performance from the Firm's proprietary risk-takingpositions. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, trading revenue of $2.7billion was up 33% from the same period last year. Fixed income and otherresults of $2.3&nbsp;billion were up 45% as a result of strong interest rate andcredit markets trading. Trading revenue, on a reported basis, excludes theimpact of Net interest income related to the Investment Bank's tradingactivities, which is recorded in Net interest income. However, the Firmincludes these revenues in trading for segment reporting purposes to betterassess the profitability of the Investment Bank's trading business. Foradditional information on trading revenue, see the Investment Bank segmentdiscussion on pages 36-38 of this Form 10-Q.Fees and commissionsFees and commissions of $2.5&nbsp;billion for the second quarter of 2003 decreased5% and 14% from the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002,respectively. For the first six months of 2003, fees and commissions fell 7%from the comparable period in 2002. The table below provides the significantcomponents of fees and commissions:&nbsp;Investment management, custody and processing servicesFees from investment management, custody and processing services remainedrelatively stable in comparison with the first quarter of 2003 but were down 9%from the second quarter of 2002. For the first half of 2003, the decrease was10% versus the same period last year. The investment management fee componentof this category declined 8% from the immediately preceding quarter and 16%from the second quarter of 2002. The decrease from the first quarter was partlyattributable to the loss of performance fees in the Investment Bank related toa sub-advised fund in Europe, following the expiration of the managementagreement in April&nbsp;2003. The declines from the second quarter and first sixmonths of 2002 were principally driven by the lower value of equity-relatedassets under management, institutional outflows and the loss of performancefees related to the expiration of the management agreement.Custody and processing services fees were up 14% versus the first quarter of2003 and remained relatively stable compared with the second quarter of 2002.The growth from the previous quarter was primarily due to a higher level ofcross-border securities transactions, to new business pertaining to debtissuances and to the seasonal increase in securities lending volume related todividend payments on non-U.S. companies' equity securities. Incomparison with the first half of 2002, fees were down 5%, driven by thedepressed values of securities under custody, the lingering slowdown incross-border investment flows and lower securities lending volume. Foradditional information on investment management, see the Investment Management& Private Banking segment discussion on pages 40-41 of this Form 10-Q. Foradditional information on custody and processing services, see Treasury &Securities Services on pages 38-39 of this Form 10-Q.Credit card revenueCredit card revenue was relatively flat in comparison with the first quarter of2003 and rose 4% from the second quarter of 2002. On a year-to-date basis,credit card revenue increased 11% over the same period in 2002. The increasesover the same periods last year were attributable to the higher level ofservicing fees associated with the $6.4&nbsp;billion and $8.2&nbsp;billion growth in theaverage securitized credit card portfolio from the second quarter and firsthalf of 2002, respectively. For a further discussion of credit card revenue, seethe Chase Cardmember Services discussion on pages 46-47 of this Form 10-Q.Brokerage and investment servicesIn the second quarter of 2003, brokerage and investment services increased 16%from the first quarter of 2003 and declined 4% from the 2002 second quarter. Ona year-to-date basis, these fees declined 6% compared with the same period lastyear. The increase from the immediately preceding quarter stemmed from theimproved performance of the equities market. The declines from the secondquarter of 2002 and the first six months of 2002 were driven by the narrowerspreads on equity brokerage transactions at the Investment Bank.28 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Mortgage servicing feesMortgage servicing fees for the second quarter of 2003 declined considerablyfrom both the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002 due tohigher amortization of mortgage servicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;) and MSR valuationadjustments in excess of derivative gains. The higher amortization andvaluation adjustments were the result of a continued decline in interest ratesover the period. However, these declines were more than offset by the resultsof the economic hedges recorded in securities gains. These same factorsresulted in lower fees for the first half of 2003 compared with the same periodin 2002. At June&nbsp;30, 2003, the balance of mortgages serviced at Chase HomeFinance stood at $437&nbsp;billion compared with $432&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003, and$436&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2002. For a further discussion of these fees, see theChase Home Finance discussion on pages 45-46 of this Form 10-Q.Other lending-related service feesIn the second quarter of 2003, other lending-related service fees wererelatively stable compared with both the first quarter of 2003 and the secondquarter of 2002. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, other lending-relatedservice fees declined 3% versus last year's same period. These results wereattributable to lower loan commitment fees and other lending-related services,partly offset by higher standby letter-of-credit fees due to new business.Deposit service feesDeposit service fees in the second quarter of 2003 were flat compared with thefirst quarter of 2003 but increased 4% from the second quarter of 2002. Theincrease from the second quarter of 2002 resulted from the lower interest rateenvironment, which reduced the value of customers' compensating depositbalances; as a consequence, customers paid incremental fees for depositservices. These increases were partly offset by lower balance-deficiency fees,as many customers at Chase Regional Banking increased their account balances bytransferring cash from brokerage accounts to more stable bank deposit accounts,in response to the uncertain market environment. On a year-to-date basis,deposit service fees remained stable.Other feesOther fees of $252&nbsp;million rose 3% from both the first quarter of 2003 and thesecond quarter of 2002. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, other feesincreased 4% compared with the same period last year. The increases in otherfees pertained to several processing-related service fees.Private equity gains (losses)Private equity losses were $29&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003, comparedwith losses of $221&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and $125&nbsp;million inthe second quarter of 2002. For the first half of the year, private equitylosses were $250&nbsp;million, versus losses of $363&nbsp;million for the same period ayear ago. For a discussion of private equity gains (losses), see the JPMorganPartners (&#147;JPMP&#148;) segment results on pages 42-43 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gainsIn the second quarter of 2003, securities gains of $768&nbsp;million were $283million higher than in the first quarter of 2003 and were$644&nbsp;million higher than in the second quarter of 2002. During the first sixmonths of 2003, securities gains of $1.3&nbsp;billion were up substantially fromgains of $238&nbsp;million in the same period last year. The 2003 second quarterresults included $312&nbsp;million of gains realized from the sales activities ofChase Home Finance's investment securities portfolio, related to hedging theeconomic value of MSRs. This compared with gains of $96&nbsp;million and $16&nbsp;millionin the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002, respectively. Forthe first half of 2003, Chase Home Finance had gains of $408&nbsp;millioncompared with gains of $3&nbsp;million for the first half of 2002.Other revenue&nbsp;29 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Residential mortgage origination and sales activities of $439&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2003 increased 16% and 201% from the first quarter of 2003and the second quarter of 2002, respectively. The increases were reflective ofthe record level of loan applications and originations, which have beenconsistently strong over the past four quarters. For additional information onmortgage-related revenue, see the Chase Financial Services segment discussionon pages 44-48 and Notes 8 and 9 of this Form 10-Q.All other revenue of $58&nbsp;million fell 44% from the 2003 first quarter and 60%from the second quarter of 2002. The second quarter of 2003 reflected areduction in the net results of the corporate and bank-owned life insurancepolicies. Thefirst quarter of 2003 reflected a gain of $27&nbsp;million on the sale of anonstrategic asset management business, partly offset by the recognition ofcertain nonoperating charges at American Century Companies, Inc. (&#147;AmericanCentury&#148;) that reduced equity income. The Firm has a 44% interest in AmericanCentury. The decline of 21% in the first six months of 2003 compared with thefirst half of 2002 primarily reflected lower net results of thecorporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by write-downs in 2002 of certain LatinAmerican investments totaling $57&nbsp;million.Net interest incomeNet interest income of $3.1&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2003 decreased$152&nbsp;million from the first quarter of 2003 but increased $181&nbsp;million from thesame period a year ago. The decline from the first quarter reflected the lowervolume of average trading assets. The increase from last year's second quarterwas primarily attributable to lower funding costs and slightly higher volumesof trading assets. The increase from the 2002 second quarter was also due tolower interest rates, which resulted in a greater volume of, and wider spreadson, consumer loans, particularly mortgages and automobile loans. Theseincreases were partially offset by lower net interest income on deposits. Forthe six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, net interest income of $6.3&nbsp;billionincreased 8% compared with the same period last year, due to lower overallfunding costs and increased mortgage and automobile loans. Trading-related netinterest income was $479&nbsp;million in the second quarter of this year, down $204million from the first quarter of 2003 but up$74&nbsp;million from the second quarter of 2002.On an aggregate basis, the Firm's total average interest-earning assets for thesecond quarter of 2003 were $571.2&nbsp;billion, compared with $598.2&nbsp;billion in thefirst quarter of 2003. The net interest yield on these assets, on a fullytaxable-equivalent basis, was 2.16% in the 2003 second quarter, three basispoints lower than in the first quarter of 2003.NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal Noninterest expense for the quarter was $5.8&nbsp;billion, up 5% from thefirst quarter of 2003 and 12% from the second quarter of 2002. For the sixmonths ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, total Noninterest expense of $11.4&nbsp;billion was up8% compared with the same period last year. The second quarter of 2003 includeda $100&nbsp;million addition to the previously established Enron-related litigationreserve. Relative to the prior year, the increases in the second quarter andthe first half reflected higher Compensation expense due to performance-drivenincentive accruals and increased stock-based compensation and pension costs.Total severance and other related costs for the Firm were $210&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2003, $171&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and $162million in the second quarter of last year. Severance and other related costsincluded the charges associated with vacant excess real estate of$128&nbsp;million and $78&nbsp;million in the second and first quarters of this year,respectively; there were no such charges for the first six months of 2002.The following table presents the components of Noninterest expense:&nbsp;30 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Compensation expenseCompensation expense in the second quarter of 2003 was $3.2&nbsp;billion, up 2% fromthe first quarter of 2003 and 17% from the second quarter of 2002. For the sixmonths ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, compensation expense of $6.4&nbsp;billion was 15% higherthan in the same period last year. The increase from the immediately precedingquarter was due to higher performance-related incentive accruals; this waspartially offset by lower severance-related costs and the transfer, at thestart of the 2003 second quarter, of approximately 2,800 employees to IBM inconnection with a technology infrastructure outsourcing agreement. Theoutsourcing agreement resulted in a shift from compensation to technologyexpenses. The increases in Compensation expense in the second quarter and firsthalf of 2003 were attributable to an increase in performance-related incentiveaccruals of $628&nbsp;million and $995&nbsp;million, respectively, and pension and otherpostretirement benefit costs of $26&nbsp;million and $31&nbsp;million, respectively. Theincentive increases included higher stock-based compensation costs of $62million and $157&nbsp;million for the second quarter and first half of 2003,respectively. Higher stock-based compensation resulted from the adoption ofSFAS 123 on January&nbsp;1, 2003, the impact of the reversal in 2002of previously accrued expenses related to certain forfeitable keyemployee stock awards granted in prior years, partially offset byreduced costs in 2003 related to thevesting of prior year awards and net forfeitures. The higher pension and otherpostretirement benefit costs were primarily due to changes in actuarialassumptions related to the expected returns on plan assets and the amortizationof unrecognized losses on plan assets. Severance-related costs in the secondquarter of 2003 were $52&nbsp;million, compared with $76&nbsp;million in the firstquarter of 2003 and $119&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002.Occupancy expenseOccupancy expense of $543&nbsp;million in the 2003 second quarter increased $47million from the first quarter of 2003 and$178&nbsp;million from the second quarter of 2002. The increase from the priorperiod reflected charges of $128&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003, versuscharges of $78&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003, to provide for anticipatedlosses on subletting unoccupied excess real estate. The increases from thesecond quarter and first half of 2002 were due to the aforementioned charges,additional leased space in midtown Manhattan, higher real estate taxes in NewYork and the costs of enhanced safety measures. JPMorgan Chase will continue toevaluate its current and projected space requirements. There is no assurancethat the Firm will be able to dispose of its excess premises or that it willnot incur additional charges in connection with such dispositions.Technology and communications expenseIn the second quarter of 2003, Technology and communications expense was $732million, up 15% from the first quarter of 2003 and 16% from the second quarterof 2002. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, Technology and communicationsexpense was $1.4&nbsp;billion, up 6% versus the same period last year. Theseincreases were due primarily to a shift in expenses from Compensation expenseand Other expense into Technology and communications expense, as a result ofthe technology infrastructure outsourcing agreement with IBM. The impact ontotal expenses as a result of this agreement is expected to be small in 2003.Other expenseIn the second quarter of 2003, Other expense declined slightly from the firstquarter of 2003 reflecting a shift in consultant costs within Professionalservices expense to Technology and communications expense as a result of approximately1,000 system consultants moving to IBM in connection with the outsourcingagreement. Also contributing to the decline in Other expense was the absence ofcosts in the Investment Bank related to a sub-advised fund in Europe as aresult of the expiration of the management agreement in April&nbsp;2003.These were offset by higher expenses associated with the growth in mortgage,credit card, securities processing and underwriting businesses.In comparison with the second quarter and first half of last year, Otherexpense was relatively unchanged as higher expenses related to businessprocessing, credit card marketing campaigns, and Enron-related legal costs,were offset by expense management initiatives. The first quarter of 2002 alsoincluded $78&nbsp;million of Sumitomo settlement costs, and the second quarter of2002 had higher amortization of intangibles. The following table presents thecomponents of other expense:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Management currently anticipates that Noninterest expense for full-year 2003will be higher than for full-year 2002 (excluding from 2002 the impact oflitigation and merger charges), driven primarily by increased incentives.Surety settlement and litigation reserveIncluded in the second quarter of 2003 was a $100&nbsp;million addition to theEnron-related litigation reserve. No such charges were recorded in the firstquarter of 2003 or in the first half of 2002.Merger and restructuring costsAll costs related to the restructuring of businesses announced after January&nbsp;1,2002, were recorded in their related expense categories. In contrast, lastyear's merger and restructuring charges of $229&nbsp;million in the second quarterand $484&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002, were viewed bymanagement as nonoperating expenses or &#147;special items.&#148; Refer to thediscussion of compensation and occupancy expenses above for a description ofrestructuring costs incurred in 2003, and to page 21 and Note 6 on page 78 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Provision for credit lossesThe 2003 second quarter Provision for credit losses of $435&nbsp;million was $308million lower than in the 2003 first quarter and$386&nbsp;million lower than in the 2002 second quarter. The provision for creditlosses for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, was $396&nbsp;million lower than forthe prior period last year. The declines from the prior periods primarilyreflected continued improvement in the quality of the commercial loanportfolio. Consumer credit quality also remained stable. See pages 52-64 ofthis Form 10-Q for a discussion of charge-offs associated with the commercialand consumer loan portfolios, and pages 63-64 of this Form 10-Q for adiscussion of the Allowance for credit losses.Income tax expenseIn the second quarter of 2003, JPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of$940&nbsp;million, compared with $722&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and $531million in the second quarter of 2002. For the first six months of 2003,JPMorgan Chase recorded Income tax expense of $1.7&nbsp;billion, compared with $1.0billion for the first six months of 2002. The effective tax rates were 34% forall periods.RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING BASISThe Firm prepares its Consolidated financial statements using U.S. GAAP. TheConsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP appearon pages 3-6 of this Form 10-Q. That presentation, which is referred to as&#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm'sresults that can be consistently tracked from year to year and enables acomparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financialstatements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementlooks at results on an &#147;operating basis,&#148; which is a non-GAAP financialmeasure, to assess each of its lines of business and to measure overall Firmresults against targeted goals. The definition of operating basis starts withthe reported U.S. GAAP results and then excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations. JPMorgan Chase periodically securitizes a portion of itscredit card portfolio by selling a pool of credit card receivables to a trust,which issues securities to investors. When credit card receivables aresecuritized, the Firm ceases to accrue the related interest and credit costs;instead, the Firm receives fee revenue for continuing to service thosereceivables and additional revenue from any interest and fees on thereceivables in excess of the interest paid to investors, net of credit lossesand servicing fees. As a result, securitization does not change JPMorganChase's reported or operating net income; however, it does affect theclassification of items in the Consolidated statement of income.The Firm also reports credit costs on a &#147;managed&#148; or &#147;operating&#148; basis. Creditcosts on an operating basis are composed of the Provision for credit losses inthe Consolidated statement of income (which includes a provision for creditcard receivables on the Consolidated balance sheet) as well as the credit costsassociated with securitized credit card loans. As the holder of the residualinterest in the securitization trust, the Firm bears its share of the creditcosts for securitized loans. In the Firm's U.S. GAAP Consolidated financialstatements, credit costs associated with securitized credit card loans reducethe noninterest income remitted to the Firm from the trust. This income isreported in credit card revenue in Fees and commissions over the life of thesecuritization.Prior to 2003, the Firm also excluded from its operating results the impact ofmerger and restructuring costs and special items, as these transactions wereviewed by management as not part of the Firm's normal daily business operationsor unusual in nature and, therefore, not indicative of trends. (To beconsidered a special item, the nonrecurring gain or loss had to be at least $75million or more during 2002 and $50&nbsp;million or more prior to 2002.) Commencingin 2003, management has determined that many of the costs previously considerednonoperating will be deemed operating costs; therefore, all such costs will beincluded in the Firm's reported results. However, it is possible that in thefuture, management may designate certain material gains or losses incurred bythe Firm to be &#147;special items.&#148;32 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following summary table provides a reconciliation between the Firm'sreported and operating results for the three and six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003and 2002:&nbsp;33 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used By the Firm in Evaluating Its Lines of BusinessThe Firm uses the shareholder value added (&#147;SVA&#148;) framework to measureperformance of its business segments. To derive SVA, a non-GAAP financialmeasure, the Firm applies a cost of capital to each business segment. Thecapital elements and resultant capital charges provide the businesses with thefinancial framework to evaluate the trade-off between the use of capital byeach business unit versus its return to shareholders.

Prior-period segment results have been adjusted toreflect alignment of management accounting policies or changes inorganizational structure among businesses.

The following table setsforth selected IB financial data:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)IB reported operating earnings of $1.1&nbsp;billion in the second quarter, comparedwith $946&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and $507&nbsp;million in the secondquarter of 2002. Operating earnings for the quarter were driven by strongcapital markets revenues and lower credit costs. For the first six months of2003, operating earnings of $2.0&nbsp;billion were 59% higher than in the sameperiod last year. Return on allocated capital for the first six months of 2003was 20%, compared with 13% in the first half of 2002. Operating revenues of$4.3&nbsp;billion in the second quarter were 5% higher than in the first quarter of2003 and up 35% from the second quarter of 2002. For the first six months of2003, operating revenues of $8.3&nbsp;billion increased 22% from the same periodlast year.Investment banking fees of $765&nbsp;million increased 23% from the first quarter of2003 and were down 2% from the second quarter of 2002. The increase comparedwith the prior quarter was due to strong debt underwriting fees and a reboundin loan syndication and equity underwriting fees. Underwriting and other feesof $603&nbsp;million were up 31% from the first quarter of 2003 and up 3% from thesecond quarter of 2002. Advisory revenues were up 1% from the first quarter of2003 but down 16% from the second quarter of 2002, reflecting continuedindustry-wide weakness in M&A. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003,Investment banking fees decreased 9% compared with the six months ended June30, 2002, primarily driven by declines in M&A activity. For the first half of2003, the Firm maintained its #1 ranking in Global loan syndications and its #2ranking in U.S. investment grade bonds, improved to #3 in Global announced M&A,with a 17% market share, and improved to #3 in U.S. equity and equity-related,with a 13% market share.1IB evaluates its capital markets activities, including sales and trading,treasury and corporate lending activities, by considering all revenues relatedto these activities. These revenues include trading revenue related to clientand risk taking activities, fees and commissions, securities gains and relatednet interest income and other revenues. In addition, these activities aremanaged on a total-return revenue basis. This includes operating revenues plusthe unrealized gains or losses on third-party or internally transfer-pricedassets and liabilities, primarily in fixed income and treasury activities,which are not accounted for on a mark-to-market basis through earnings.Capital markets & lending total-return revenue was $3.2&nbsp;billion, down 3% and up35% from the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002,respectively. Fixed income total-return revenue of $2.1&nbsp;billion increased 8%from the first quarter of 2003 and 55% from the second quarter of 2002,primarily driven by strength in North American credit markets, Latin America,interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange trading. Global Treasury, whichmanages the Firm's interest rate exposure and investment securities activity,had revenue of $438&nbsp;million, down 18% from the record results posted in thefirst quarter of 2003 but up 104% from the second quarter of 2002. GlobalTreasury's activities complement, and offer a strategic balance anddiversification benefit to, the Firm's trading activities. Credit Portfoliototal-return revenue of $299&nbsp;million was down 28% from the first quarter of 2003 anddown 32% from the second quarter of 2002 due to mark-to-market losses on credithedging activity. Equities total-return revenue was $390&nbsp;million in the secondquarter of 2003, a decrease of 11% from the first quarter of 2003 and up 5%from the second quarter of 2002. The growth in equities compared with last yearreflected improved results in derivatives, partially offset by declines inconvertibles. On an operating revenue basis, Capital markets & lending revenueof $3.5&nbsp;billion in the second quarter was 1% above the first quarter of 2003and 47% above the second quarter of 2002.For the first six months of 2003, Capital markets & lending total-returnrevenue was $6.6&nbsp;billion, up 23% from last year. Fixed income total-returnresults were up 32% due to strong trading results in credit markets, Europeaninterest rate markets, Latin America and foreign exchange. Treasurytotal-return results were up 42% from last year due to risk positioning tobenefit from interest rate movements. Credit portfolio revenues of $712&nbsp;millionwere down 8% from last year due to mark-to-market losses on credit hedgingactivity and a lower level of commercial loan outstandings. Equities revenue of$826&nbsp;million was up 1% due to strength in derivatives, partially offset byweakness in convertibles. For the first six months of 2003, Capital markets &lending operating revenue was $6.9&nbsp;billion, up 31% from last year.Operating expense of $2.5&nbsp;billion increased 9% from the first quarter of 2003and 23% from the second quarter of 2002, primarily driven by higher incentivesresulting from improved financial performance. Noncompensation expenseincreased 12% from the second quarter of 2002, primarily as a result of the$100&nbsp;million addition to the Enron-related litigation reserve. Excluding thelitigation charge in the second quarter of 2003, Noncompensation expensedecreased 1%. Severance and related costs increased 44% from the first quarterof 2003 and 21% from the second quarter of 2002, primarily driven by $104million in charges to provide for anticipated losses on subletting unoccupiedexcess real estate. Including these severance and related costs, the overheadratio for the second quarter was 58%, compared with 56% in the first quarter of2003 and 63% in the second quarter of 2002.For the first six months of 2003, operating expense was $4.7&nbsp;billion, up 16%compared with the same period last year, mainly due to higher compensationcosts from improved earnings. Noncompensation costs of $1.8&nbsp;billion werebasically flat to the first half of 2002. Operating expense for the first sixmonths of 2003 included severance and related costs of $254&nbsp;million, comparedwith $171&nbsp;million for the same period last year. For the six months ended June30, 2003, including severance and related costs, the overhead ratio was 57%,compared with 60% for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002.&nbsp;37 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Credit costs were negative $4&nbsp;million for the quarter, down from $245&nbsp;millionfrom the first quarter of 2003 and $306&nbsp;million from the second quarter of2002. The allowance for credit losses declined as there was no provision forcharge-offs by the IB in the quarter. The lower allowance reflected animprovement in the credit quality of the portfolio. For the first six months of2003, credit costs were $241&nbsp;million or 59% lower than in the same period lastyear. For additional information, see Credit Risk Management on pages 52-64 ofthis Form 10-Q.Effective in the second quarter of 2003, management assigned to T&SS pre-taxearnings and allocated capital associated with certain credit exposures withinthe Investment Bank's credit portfolio on behalf of clients shared with T&SS.Prior periods have been restated to reflect this allocation. The impact to theIB of this change decreased pre-tax operating results by $11&nbsp;million andaverage allocated capital by $819&nbsp;million, and it increased shareholder valueadded by $18&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003.The IB expects results in the second half of 2003 to moderate due to a seasonalslowdown in activity and fewer opportunities for trading and treasuryactivities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;T&SS&#148;), see pages 29&#150;30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.

Return on allocated capital for the quarter was 18%, compared with 19%for the first quarter of 2003 and 25% for the second quarter of 2002. For thefirst six months of 2003, operating earnings of $258&nbsp;million were 14% lowercompared with the same period last year. Return on allocated capital for thefirst six months of 2003 was 19%, compared with 22% for the same period lastyear.Operating revenue was $984&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003, an increaseof 5% from the first quarter of 2003 and a decrease of 1% from the secondquarter of 2002. Treasury Services revenues decreased by 1% from the firstquarter of 2003 and increased by 7% from the second quarter of 2002, due tohigher trade finance revenues, increased commercial card revenues and higherbalance-related revenue; the latter included higher fees earned for depositservices resulting from the reduced value of customers' compensating balances,driven by the lower interest rate environment. Investor Services revenuesincreased 6% from the first quarter of 2003, primarily due to higher securitieslending and asset-based fees, as well as higher foreign exchange revenueresulting from increased volume. Revenues decreased 14% from the second quarterof 2002, the result of reduced balances, asset-based fees, foreign exchangerevenue and securities lending activities. Institutional Trust Servicesrevenues were up 17% from the first quarter of 2003 and 8% from the secondquarter of 2002, due to increased American depositary receipt (&#147;ADR&#148;) issuanceand cancellation activities, growth in selected debt product lines, increasedvolume in the asset servicing business and the impact of acquisitions.Total T&SS revenues for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, of $1.9&nbsp;billionwere 1% lower compared with the same period last year: Investor Servicesrevenues decreased by 12%, offset by higher revenues at Treasury Services of 7%and at Institutional Trust Services of 4%.Operating expense increased 7% from the first quarter of 2003 and 6% from thesecond quarter of 2002, reflecting charges to provide for anticipated losses onsubletting unoccupied excess real estate, higher severance, the impact ofacquisitions, the cost associated with expensing of options and increasedpension costs. The overhead ratio of 81% for the second quarter increased from80% in the first quarter of 2003 and 76% in the second quarter of 2002. For thefirst six months of 2003, operating expense was $1.5&nbsp;billion, up 3% from thesame period last year. The overhead ratio for the first six monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2003, was 80%, compared with 78% for the same period last year.Effective with the second quarter of 2003, T&SS is being assigned a corporatecredit allocation of pre-tax earnings and the associated capital related tocertain credit exposures managed within the Investment Bank's credit portfolioon behalf of clients shared with T&SS. Prior periods have been restated toreflect this allocation. For the second quarter of 2003, the impact to T&SS ofthis change increased pre-tax operating results by $11&nbsp;million and averageallocated capital by $819&nbsp;million, and it decreased shareholder value added by$18&nbsp;million.On July&nbsp;16, 2003, JPMorgan Chase announced its agreement to acquire Bank One'scorporate trust services business for approximately $720&nbsp;million in cash, ofwhich approximately 10% of the purchase price is contingent on businessretention.

Thefollowing table reflects selected financial data of IMPB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPB reported operating earnings of $69&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003,an increase of 92% from the first quarter of 2003 and a decrease of 16% fromthe second quarter of 2002. Pre-tax margin was 15%, compared with 10% in thefirst quarter of 2003 and 18% in the second quarter of 2002. For the first sixmonths of 2003, operating earnings of $105&nbsp;million were 42% lower compared withthe same period last year. Return on allocated capital for the second quarterof 2003 was 5%, compared with 3% in the first quarter of 2003 and 6% in thesecond quarter of 2002. Return on tangible allocated capital was 21% for thesecond quarter of 2003, compared with 12% in the first quarter of 2003 and 21%in the second quarter of 2002.Operating revenue was $684&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003, 6% higherthan in the first quarter of 2003 and 6% lower than in the second quarter of2002. For the first six months of 2003, revenues of $1.3&nbsp;billion were 11% lowercompared with the same period last year. The second quarter of 2003, when compared with the first quarterof 2003, primarily reflects increasing global equity valuations and stronger brokerage activity partly offset by net institutional outflows. Lower global equityvaluations (the S&P 500 index was down approximately 14% from the prior year'slevel) and institutional outflows contributed to the decrease in revenue versusthe second quarter and first half of 2002. Revenue for the quarter included thenew subsidiary, Retirement Planning Services (&#147;RPS&#148;), acquired on June&nbsp;2, 2003.Operating expense of $578&nbsp;million for the quarter was flat compared with thefirst quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002. For the first six monthsof 2003, operating expense of $1.2&nbsp;billion was flat compared with the sameperiod last year. The impact of merger and other expense savings initiativesimplemented during 2002 and 2003 was offset by higher compensation expense andadditional expenses arising from the acquisition of RPS. Credit costs were zerofor the second quarter of 2003 and were down from $6&nbsp;million in the firstquarter of 2003 and $23&nbsp;million from the second quarter of 2002. For the firstsix months of 2003, credit costs were $6&nbsp;million, down from $46&nbsp;million for thesame period last year.

The following table setsforth selected financial data of JPMP:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMP reported an operating loss of $91&nbsp;million for the 2003 second quarter,compared with operating losses of $217&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and$168&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2002. For the first six months of 2003,operating losses of $308&nbsp;million improved 25% compared with the same periodlast year.Total net private equity losses in the second quarter of 2003 were $22&nbsp;million,compared with losses of $230&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and $126million in the second quarter of 2002. Although the current quarter's resultsreflect some improvement, private equity market conditions remain muted, withlimited exit opportunities. In the current quarter, JPMP's direct privateequity investments recorded net gains of $123&nbsp;million, compared with a net lossof $136&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 and a net loss of $135&nbsp;million inthe second quarter of 2002. JPMP's direct private equity results included $153million in net realized cash gains and $147&nbsp;million of mark-to-market gains onpublic investments, which were partially offset by write-downs and write-offsof $177&nbsp;million taken on direct private investment positions. In the secondquarter of 2003, JPMP recorded a $145&nbsp;million loss in its private third-partyfund investments, compared with a net loss of $94&nbsp;million and a net gain of $9million in the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002,respectively. The results in the second quarter of 2003 included losses on thedisposition of funded limited partnership interests under contract to be soldin the third quarter of 2003 and additional performance deterioration in theremaining private third-party fund portfolio.Management intends to reduce, over time, the JPMP private equity portfolio fromapproximately 20% of the Firm's common stockholders' equity at December&nbsp;31,2002, to approximately 10%. Reductions in noncore assets, such as sales ofinvestments in third-party funds, will contribute to achieving this target. Asa result of the continued soft market conditions and opportunistic dispositionsof noncore assets, private equity losses in the second half of 2003 could besimilar to JPMP's first-half results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Partners Investment PortfolioThe following table presents the carrying value and cost of the JPMP investmentportfolio for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying value of technology, media and telecommunications (&#147;TMT&#148;)investments at June&nbsp;30, 2003, was $1.4&nbsp;billion, or 18% of the total portfolio,compared with $1.7&nbsp;billion, or 20% of the portfolio, at June&nbsp;30, 2002. Thereduction was primarily the result of write-downs and write-offs in theportfolio, partially offset by an increase in the carrying values of certainpublic securities as a result of an IPO in the technology sector and morefavorable market conditions. The carrying value of industrial growthinvestments increased to 29% of the total portfolio at June&nbsp;30, 2003, comparedwith 24% at June&nbsp;30, 2002, reflecting JPMP's increased investment in industrialbuyout activity during the period.JPMP made direct investments of $169&nbsp;million for the Firm's account during thesecond quarter of 2003, with approximately 50% of the dollars invested in theindustrial growth sector.&nbsp;The industry group percentages in the accompanying table are based on thecarrying values of JPMP's private equity portfolio as of June&nbsp;30, 2003,December&nbsp;31, 2002, and June&nbsp;30, 2002. In terms of dollar amounts, some industrysectors have the same, or lower, carrying values at June&nbsp;30, 2003, as comparedwith December&nbsp;31, 2002, and June&nbsp;30, 2002, but these sectors may comprise thesame or a higher percentage of the total carrying value of the June&nbsp;30, 2003,portfolio than they did at December&nbsp;31, 2002, and June&nbsp;30, 2002.

The following table reflects selected financial data of CFS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CFS reported record operating earnings of $883&nbsp;million in the second quarter of2003, an increase of 30% from the first quarter of 2003 and 36% from the secondquarter of 2002. For the first six months of 2003, operating earnings of $1.6billion were 37% higher compared with the same period last year. Return onallocated capital for the second quarter was 41%, compared with 32% for theprevious quarter and 30% for the second quarter of 2002. For the first sixmonths of 2003, return on allocated capital was 37%, compared with 26% for thesame period last year.Operating revenue was a record $4.0&nbsp;billion, an 8% increase from the firstquarter of 2003 and an increase of 17% from the second quarter of 2002. For thesix months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, operating revenues were $7.7&nbsp;billion, or 19%higher than in the same period last year. The increases in both the quarterlyand year-to-date periods were driven by continued high production volumesacross all consumer credit businesses, partially offset by the negative impactof low interest rates on deposits. The national consumer credit businessescontributed 77% of CFS's second quarter 2003 operating revenue. Chase HomeFinance revenues of $1.3&nbsp;billion were 71% higher than in the prior year'ssecond quarter, due to record mortgage originations and, to a lesser extent,gains on the hedging of mortgage servicing rights (&#147;MSRs&#148;). Auto Finance alsoreported record revenues in the second quarter, up 35% from the second quarterof 2002, driven by higher originations reflecting increased market share.Cardmember Services revenues were up 2% from the second quarter of 2002,reflecting growth in fee-related revenues. Regional Banking and Middle Marketaverage deposits grew 7% and 12%, respectively, from the second quarter of2002. However, both reported lower revenue as declining interest rates resultedin reduced net interest income, despite the higher deposit balances. In arising interest rate environment, the volume of mortgage applications and therelated revenues from originations and interest spreads are likely to decline.In such an environment, management would act to reduce expenses commensuratewith a decline in volumes and spreads. However, such expense reductions may beat a slower pace than the decline in revenue.Operating expense of $1.8&nbsp;billion for the quarter was 1% higher compared withthe first quarter of 2003 and increased 8% from the second quarter of 2002. Forthe first six months of 2003, Operating expense was up 11% compared with thesame period last year. The increases, compared with last year's three monthsand six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002, reflected higher business volumes,increased marketing costs, and higher performance-related incentive accruals.Savings generated by Six Sigma productivity programs continued to partiallyoffset the growth in expenses. CFS's overhead ratio was 44%, compared with 47%for the first quarter of 2003 and 48% for the second quarter of 2002. For thefirst six months of 2003, the overhead ratio improved to 46%, down 300 basispoints compared with the same period last year. The improved overhead ratiosreflect the growth in revenues and disciplined expense management.44 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Credit costs on a managed basis (including securitized credit cards) of $817million decreased 7% compared with the first quarter of 2003 and increased 11%compared with the second quarter of 2002. Charge-offs decreased 2% from thesecond quarter of 2002, due to improved credit quality, despite a 21% increasein average managed loans. Charge-offs were down slightly in the second quarterof 2003 compared with the first quarter of 2003. Delinquency rates in theconsumer loan portfolios have decreased compared with the first quarter of 2003due to effective risk management and collection practices. For the first sixmonths of 2003, credit costs of $1.7&nbsp;billion were 16% higher compared with thesame period last year, due to higher outstanding loan balances, weakness in thefirst quarter of 2003 in the manufactured housing market and a higher amount ofcharge-offs in excess of provision for credit losses in the second quarter of2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within CFS. For further information on the quarterlybusiness-related metrics of these businesses, see page 77 of this Form 10-Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chase Home FinanceIn the second quarter of 2003, Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;) achieved anotherrecord quarter, with operating earnings of$568&nbsp;million, an increase of 32% compared with the first quarter of 2003 and118% compared with the second quarter of 2002. CHF's higher earnings were dueto continued strong operating revenue growth and expense management. For thefirst six months of 2003, earnings were approximately $1&nbsp;billion, or a 157%increase over the same period last year.45 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Record operating revenue of $1.3&nbsp;billion for the second quarter of 2003increased 16% and 71% from the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of2002, respectively. Operating revenue for the first six months of 2003 was $2.5billion, 89% higher than in the same period last year. The increase inoperating revenue was driven by high production volumes and, to a lesserextent, gains on the hedging of MSRs when compared with prior periods. Strongrevenues were also the result of CHF's continued expansion into strategicbusiness sectors, such as home equity, where origination volumes increased 39%and 56% compared with the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002,respectively. Management anticipates an eventual decrease in revenues asinterest rates, origination volumes and interest rate spreads revert to normallevels.During 2003, CHF capitalized on record levels of residential first mortgageloan applications and originations, due primarily to historically low interestrates. Total origination volume in the 2003 second quarter was at an all-timehigh of $78&nbsp;billion, an increase of 26% and 189% from the first quarter of 2003and the second quarter of 2002, respectively. For the first six months of 2003,total origination volume was $140&nbsp;billion, an increase of 137% from the sameperiod of 2002. Loan originations through higher-margin channels (i.e., retail,wholesale, telephone-based and e-commerce) for the second quarter were $55billion, 34% and 150% higher than in the first quarter of 2003 and the secondquarter of 2002, respectively. For the first six months of 2003, originationsthrough higher margin channels were $96&nbsp;billion, a 118% increase over the sameperiod in 2002. CHF's correspondent-negotiated transaction volume totaled $23billion, an increase of 10% and 360% compared with the first quarter of 2003and second quarter of 2002, respectively, reflecting improved market conditionsand pricing.For the second quarter of 2003, MSR negative valuation adjustments of $799million were more than offset by an aggregate $1.0&nbsp;billion of derivative gains,realized gains on sales of AFS securities and net interest earned on AFSsecurities. The net positive result of $233&nbsp;million for the second quarter of2003 compared with $86&nbsp;million and $133&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2003and the second quarter of 2002, respectively. For the first six months of 2003,MSR negative valuation adjustments of $1.3&nbsp;billion were more than offset by anaggregate $1.6&nbsp;billion of derivative gains, realized gains on sales of AFSsecurities and net interest earned on AFS securities. The net positive resultof $319&nbsp;million for the first six months of 2003 compared with a negative $1million for the first six months of 2002. The second quarter and first halfresults for 2003 reflect continued strong management of the interest ratesensitivity of MSRs by CHF and the Firm's Global Treasury Group.Operating expense of$375&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003 was up 4% and20% compared with the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002,respectively. For the first six months of 2003, operating expense of $736million was 21% higher compared with the same period last year. The increasein operating expense over the second quarter and first six months of2002 was aresult of growth in origination volume and a high level of servicing activity.The increase from the first quarter of 2003 was primarily attributable tocontinued high origination volume, partially offset by productivity gainsresulting from increased production efficiency initiatives.Credit costs of $58&nbsp;million for the second quarter of 2003 declined 46% fromthe first quarter of 2003. Credit quality improved, reflecting lower nonaccrualbalances and lower delinquency rates. The net charge-off rate for the secondquarter of 2003 was 0.18%, down from the first quarter of 2003 and the secondquarter of 2002, primarily the result of a higher proportion of loans thatwere originated for sale. For the first six months of 2003 credit costs were$166&nbsp;million, up 80% from the first six months of 2002. The increase was due toa higher provision for credit losses, primarily the result of higher loanbalances and weakness in the manufactured housing market during the firstquarter of 2003.The carrying value of MSRs at June&nbsp;30, 2003, was $3.0&nbsp;billion, a 6% decreasefrom both December&nbsp;31, 2002, and March&nbsp;31, 2003, the result of a continueddecline in interest rates over the period. The Firm offsets its interest raterisk exposure to MSRs by designating certain interest rate derivatives (i.e., acombination of swaps, swaptions and floors) as fair value hedges of specifiedMSRs in accordance with SFAS 133. AFS securities and certain &#147;nonhedge&#148;derivatives are also used to manage the risk exposure of the MSRs. For afurther discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see thediscussion above and Note 20 of this Form 10-Q.The mortgage servicing portfolio was $437&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, an increaseof 1% compared with the first quarter of 2003 and essentially flat to thesecond quarter of 2002.Chase Cardmember ServicesChase Cardmember Services (&#147;CCS&#148;) operating earnings in the second quarter of2003 were $173&nbsp;million, an increase of 13% from the first quarter of 2003 and4% from the second quarter of 2002. During the first six months of 2003,operating earnings increased 7% compared with the same period last year. Theincrease in earnings from all periods reflected higher revenues and disciplinedexpense management. The earnings increase from a year ago also reflected animprovement in credit quality.Operating revenue increased 3% from the first quarter of 2003 and 2% from thesecond quarter of 2002. The increase in operating revenue from the 2002 secondquarter and 2003 first quarter reflected higher fee-related revenue. Totalvolume (purchases, balance transfers and cash advances) increased 6% from thesecond quarter of 2002 and 7% from the first quarter of 2003. End-of-periodmanaged loans increased 3% from the second quarter of 2002 and 1% from thefirst quarter of 2003 to $51&nbsp;billion. For the first six months of 2003,operating revenue increased 5% compared with the same period last year,reflecting higher loans outstanding, lower funding costs and an increase infee-related revenue, partly offset by a lower yield.46 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense increased 1% from the first quarter of 2003 and 3% from thesecond quarter of 2002. The increase from the second quarter of 2002 reflectedgreater investments in marketing, partly offset by disciplined expensemanagement. For the second consecutive quarter, CCS added more than one millionnew accounts, bringing total customer accounts above 30&nbsp;million. Operatingexpense was up 7% for the first six months of 2003 compared with the firstsix months of 2002, primarily reflecting higher marketing costs and highervolume-related expenses.The managed net charge-off rate for the second quarter was 6.01%, up 14 basispoints from the first quarter of 2003 but down 40 basis points from the secondquarter of 2002. The slight increase in the net charge-off rate from the firstquarter of 2003 reflected higher bankruptcy losses. The decline from the secondquarter of 2002 was attributable to lower nonbankruptcy losses, reflectingeffective risk management and collection practices. The managed net charge-offrate for the six-month period was 5.94%, compared with 6.12% for the sameperiod of 2002. The 30&#043; delinquency rate was 4.40% in the second quarter of2003, down 19 basis points from the first quarter of 2003 and up 23 basispoints from the second quarter of 2002.Chase Auto FinanceChase Auto Finance (&#147;CAF&#148;) results consist of the Auto Finance and EducationFinance businesses. CAF's operating earnings of$68&nbsp;million increased 74% from the first quarter of 2003 and decreased 14% fromthe second quarter of 2002. The increase in operating earnings from the firstquarter of 2003 was driven by continued revenue growth, improved operatingefficiency, higher overall spreads due to short-term funding of loansdesignated for securitization and lower credit costs. Earnings decreased fromthe second quarter of last year, as strong revenue growth and improvement inoperating efficiency were offset by higher credit costs, due to a higher amountof charge-offs in excess of provision for credit losses in the second quarterof last year. For the first six months of 2003, operating earnings were $107million, or 2% lower compared with the same period last year. The decreasereflected higher revenue on increased average loan outstandings and lowerfunding costs, offset by higher operating expenses and higher credit costs dueto volume growth and a higher amount of charge-offs in excess of provision forcredit losses for the first six months of last year.CAF reported record revenue of $223&nbsp;million for the second quarter of 2003, up12% from the first quarter of 2003 and 35% from the second quarter of 2002. Theincrease in revenue was driven by strong operating performance, due to higheraverage loans outstanding, lower funding costs and improved originationvolumes. CAF had record loan and lease origination volume of $7.9&nbsp;billion inthe second quarter of 2003, a 7% increase from the first quarter of 2003 and a52% increase from the second quarter of 2002. For the first six months of 2003,operating revenue of $422&nbsp;million was up 26% compared with the same period lastyear. For the first six months of 2003, origination volume of $15.3&nbsp;billion wasat a record level, up 40% compared with the same period last year.Operating expense of $72&nbsp;million was up 7% from the first quarter of 2003 and18% from the second quarter of 2002. For the first six months of 2003,Operating expense of $139&nbsp;million was 14% higher compared with the same periodlast year. The increase in expenses was driven by higher origination volumes.Credit costs increased during the first six months of 2003 compared with thefirst six months of 2002, due to higher volumes of loans outstanding and ahigher amount of charge-offs in excess of provision for credit losses in thefirst six months of 2002. Credit quality continued to improve, as evidenced bycharge-off rates and 30&#043; delinquency rates, which were lower than in the firstquarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002. The charge-off rate improved to0.37% in the second quarter of 2003, from 0.48% in the first quarter of 2003and 0.38% in the second quarter of 2002. The 30&#043; delinquency rate improved to1.14% in the second quarter of 2003, from 1.27% in the first quarter of 2003and 1.53% in the second quarter of 2002.Chase Regional BankingChase Regional Banking (&#147;CRB&#148;) operating earnings of $42&nbsp;million in the secondquarter of 2003 increased 17% compared with the first quarter of 2003 anddeclined 53% from the 2002 second quarter. The increase from the first quarterof 2003 was primarily due to the recognition of a further gain on the sale ofCRB's Eastern Caribbean operations. The decline from the second quarter of 2002primarily resulted from declining spreads on deposits, partially offset by a 7%growth in average deposits. For the first six months of 2003, operatingearnings of $78&nbsp;million declined 62% compared with the same period last year,driven by lower deposit spreads and a higher amount of charge-offs in excess ofprovision for credit losses that occurred in the first half of 2002.Operating revenue of $658&nbsp;million increased 4% from the first quarter of 2003and declined 8% from the second quarter of 2002. The decline in revenue fromthe second quarter of 2002 was predominantly attributable to the lower interestrate environment, which resulted in lower net interest earned on depositbalances. Growth in retail deposits of 3% from the first quarter of 2003 and 7%from the second quarter of 2002 partially offset the decline. For the first sixmonths of 2003, operating revenue declined 10% compared with the same periodlast year due to the lower interest rate environment.47 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense for the second quarter of 2003 was up 1% from the firstquarter of 2003 and 3% from the second quarter of 2002. For the first sixmonths of 2003, operating expense of $1.1&nbsp;billion was 2% higher compared withthe same period last year. The increases from 2002 were due to highercompensation costs resulting from higher staff levels.As of June&nbsp;30, 2003, CRB's deposit mix was 18% demand deposit accounts, 14%interest checking, 48% savings, 9% money market and 11% time deposits (CDs). AtJune&nbsp;30, 2002, the deposit mix was 19% demand deposit accounts, 13% interestchecking, 46% savings, 8% money market and 14% time deposits (CDs). Coredeposits (total deposits less time deposits) at June&nbsp;30, 2003 grew 9% sinceDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, and 11% from June&nbsp;30, 2002.Chase Middle MarketChase Middle Market (&#147;CMM&#148;) operating earnings were down 10% from the firstquarter of 2003 and 9% from the second quarter of 2002. The decrease from bothperiods was primarily attributable to lower deposit spreads as a result of thelower interest rate environment and higher expenses for severance and operatinglosses, partially offset by improved credit quality. For the six months endedJune&nbsp;30, 2003, CMM's earnings were flat compared with the same period a yearago.Operating revenues of $355&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003 decreased 2%compared with both the first quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002.The decrease from the first quarter of this year was due to lower depositspreads. The decrease from the same quarter last year was the result of thelower interest rate environment, partially offset by higher deposit levels andcapital markets fees. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, revenues weredown $14&nbsp;million, or 2%, from the same period last year. Deposits were up 18%and loans increased 6% when compared with the first six months of 2002;however, net interest income was down 4% due to the lower-rate environment. Thedeclines for all of the above periods were partially offset by higher depositservice fees, as the lower interest rate environment resulted in reduced valuesof customers' compensating balances; consequently, customers paid incrementalfees for deposit services.Operating expense was $218&nbsp;million, an increase of 4% compared with both thefirst quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2002. For the first six monthsof 2003, operating expense of $428&nbsp;million was 3% higher than in the sameperiod last year, primarily due to higher severance costs. The credit qualityof CMM's portfolio continues to improve. Charge-offs decreased in the secondquarter of 2003 compared with the 2003 first quarter and the second quarter of2002.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's Support Units and Corporate segment includes EnterpriseTechnology Services, legal, audit, corporate finance, human resources, riskmanagement and corporate marketing. For a further discussion of the businessprofiles of these Support Units as well as a description of Corporate, see page39 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate reflects the accounting effects remaining at the corporate levelafter the application of management accounting policies of the Firm. Thesepolicies include the allocation of costs associated with technology,operational and staff support services to the respective revenue-generatingbusinesses and allow management to evaluate business performance on anallocated basis. The higher level of negative revenues compared with theprior periods primarily reflected the reduction in the net results ofthe corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies. The year-to-date increase in expenses from a yearago was attributable to higher incentives, including the impact of reversalslast year of previously accrued expensesrelated to certain forfeitable stock awards, and higher technology-relatedcosts.The Corporate segment has historically reported a net loss, primarily driven bynegative revenue. Negative revenue in the Corporate segment results from theoverallocation to business segments of capital (thus generating negative netinterest income), as well as the overallocation of revenues that arise from theapplication of funds transfer pricing and other management accounting policies.Expense items in the Corporate segment result from timing differences inallocations to business segments, residuals from48 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)interoffice allocation among the business segments and other items consideredappropriate to retain in the Corporate segment. Although the Corporate segmentgenerally has no credit exposures, the residual component of the allowance forcredit losses is maintained in this segment and is not allocated to anyspecific business segment. For the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, theresidual component increased by $100&nbsp;million. For a further discussion of theresidual component, see pages 63-64 of this Form 10-Q.In the first quarter of 2003, the Firm initiated a review of its managementaccounting policies. As a result of such review, certain operating results,primarily income tax expenses, that had originally been recorded within theCorporate segment have been allocated to other business segments, principallyto Investment Management & Private Banking. Prior periods have been restated toreflect current methodologies. Management is continuing to assess theappropriate allocation of items remaining in the Corporate segment andanticipates additional allocations from the Corporate segment to the otherbusiness segments in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational,business, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion of these risksand definitions of terms associated with managing these risks, see pages 40&#150;65and the Glossary of Terms in JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic capitalJPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy utilizing internal risk assessmentmethodologies. The Firm assigns economic risk capital based primarily on fiverisk factors: credit risk, market risk, operational risk and business risk(together formerly operating risk as discussed below) for each business, andprivate equity risk (principally for JPMP). The methodologies quantify theserisks and assign capital accordingly. Additionally, the Firm assesses capitalagainst certain nonrisk factors.A review of the Firm's risk and capital measurement methodologies was completedin the second quarter of 2003, resulting in the reallocation of capital amongthe risk categories and certain business segments. New capital measurementmethodologies were implemented but have not resulted in a significant change inthe total capital allocated to the business segments as a whole. Prior periodshave been restated to reflect the revised capital measurement methodologies.See JPMorgan Chase's Form 8-K dated July&nbsp;11, 2003, for more details.The new methodology for the assessment of commercial credit risk capitalemploys estimates of default likelihood that are derived from current marketparameters to capture the impact of both defaults and declines in market valuedue to credit deterioration. This approach is intended to reflect currentmarket conditions and enhance the management of commercial credit risk, byencouraging the utilization of the growing markets in credit derivatives andsecondary market loan sales.Operating risk capital has been separated into operational risk capital andbusiness risk capital. Under the prior methodology, operating risk capital wasallocated to each business based on its complexity, expense base and controlquality without an explicit linkage to the measurement of operational losses.The new operational risk capital model is loss-based, with adjustments toreflect changes in the quality of the control environment, and with a potentialoffset for the use of risk-transfer products. Operational risk is the risk ofloss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors orexternal events. Business risk is defined as the risk associated with thevolatility in the Firm's earnings due to factors not captured by other parts ofthe Firm's economic capital framework. For business risk, capital is allocatedto each business based on historical revenue volatility and measures of fixedand variable expenses. Earnings volatility arising from other risk factors suchas credit, market or operational risks is excluded from the measurement ofbusiness risk capital, as these factors are captured under those risk capitalmodels. The revised methodology resulted in an overall lower amount of capitalallocated to the businesses with respect to operational and business risks.In refining the capital methodology for private equity risk, JPMorgan Chase hasassigned a moderately higher amount of capital for the risk in the privateequity portfolio. Most of the private equity capital is assigned to JPMorganPartners.The Firm's capital in excess of internally required capital at June&nbsp;30, 2003,increased by $1.8&nbsp;billion over June&nbsp;30, 2002, due to an increase in commonstockholders' equity of $1.9&nbsp;billion. Credit risk capital increased over theperiod, primarily due to a higher level of nonperforming commercial loans. Thedecrease in market risk capital was due to lower stress and VAR results inseveral businesses in the Investment Bank and Chase Home Finance. Privateequity capital decreased primarily due to the lower carrying value of theportfolio. Internal capital allocation methodologies may change to reflectrefinements of economic capital methodologies.49 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should be read inconjunction with page 41 and Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory CapitalJPMorgan Chase's risk-based capital ratios at June&nbsp;30, 2003, were well inexcess of minimum regulatory guidelines. At June&nbsp;30, 2003, Tier 1 and TotalCapital ratios were 8.7% and 12.4%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 5.5%. At June&nbsp;30, 2003, total capital of JPMorgan Chase (the sum of Tier 1and Tier 2 Capital) was $58.8&nbsp;billion, an increase of $4.4&nbsp;billion fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. This increase principally reflected a $3.5&nbsp;billion increasein Tier 1 Capital, driven by $1.8&nbsp;billion in retained earnings (net income lesscommon and preferred dividends) generated during the period, $1.1&nbsp;billion inTier 1 trust preferred issuance and$0.6&nbsp;billion in net stock issuances related to employee benefit plans. Theremaining increase in total capital primarily reflected an increase in thesubordinated debt component of Tier 2 capital. The Firm did not repurchaseshares of its common stock during the first six months of 2003.DividendsIn the second quarter of 2003, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cashdividend on its common stock of $0.34 per share, payable July&nbsp;31, 2003, tostockholders of record at the close of business on July&nbsp;3, 2003.&nbsp;LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should be read inconjunction with pages 42&#150;43 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.In managing liquidity, management considers a variety of liquidity riskmeasures as well as market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidityneeds and the desired maturity profile of its liabilities.JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management framework utilizes liquidity monitoringtools and a contingency funding plan to maintain appropriate levels ofliquidity through normal and stress periods. The parent company's liquiditypolicy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet funding requirements fornormal operating activities and to repay all obligations with a maturity of oneyear and under. In addition, JPMorgan Chase maintains appropriate liquidity tomanage through normal and stress periods, taking into account historical dataon funding of loan commitments (i.e., commercial paper back-up facilities),liquidity commitments to conduits and collateral-posting requirements. Sourcesof funds include the capital markets, the operations of the Firm's subsidiaries(including the ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank to raise funds through deposits)and securitization programs.Consistent with its liquidity management policy, the Firm has raised funds atthe holding company sufficient to cover estimated obligations that will matureover the next 12&nbsp;months. Long-term funding needs for the parent holding companyover the next several quarters are expected to be modest.50 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Credit RatingsJPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorgan Chase Bank's creditratings as of July&nbsp;31, 2003, were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;As of July&nbsp;31, 2003, the ratings outlook for the parent holding company byMoody's Investor Services (&#147;Moody's&#148;) and Fitch, Inc. (&#147;Fitch&#148;) was stable, andthe ratings outlook for the parent holding company by Standard & Poor's (&#147;S&P&#148;)was negative.Balance sheetThe Firm's total assets increased $44&nbsp;billion to $803&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003,from $759&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, principally due to an unusually highlevel of U.S. Treasury securities settlement failures (especially 10-year U.S.Treasury Notes) by major market participants in the second quarter of 2003; theeffect of these settlement failures was to increase both Other assets andAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities by approximately $20billion. Other than the balance sheet impact, the settlement failures hadessentially no impact on the Firm's results for the six months ended June&nbsp;30,2003. Mortgage loans were also up significantly, reflecting the recordorigination and refinancing activity brought on by lower interest rates.IssuancesDuring the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, JPMorgan Chase issued approximately$9.0&nbsp;billion of long-term debt; during the same period, $4.9&nbsp;billion oflong-term debt matured or was redeemed. In addition, the Firm securitizedapproximately$5.5&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans, $4.3&nbsp;billion of credit card loansand $2.0&nbsp;billion in automobile loans, resulting in pre-tax gains onsecuritizations of $143.4&nbsp;million, $21.9&nbsp;million and $2.9&nbsp;million,respectively. For a further discussion of loan securitizations, see Note 8 ofthis Form 10-Q and Note 11 on pages 83&#150;87 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 AnnualReport.Off-Balance sheet arrangementsSpecial-purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) or special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;) are animportant part of the financial markets, providing market liquidity byfacilitating investors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks.JPMorgan Chase is involved with SPEs in three broad categories of transactions:loan securitizations, multi-seller conduits and client intermediation. Capitalis held, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and exposuressuch as derivative transactions and lending commitments. The Firm has nocommitments to issue its own stock to support an SPE transaction, and itspolicies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm's length andreflect market pricing. For a further discussion of SPEs and the Firm'saccounting for SPEs, see Note 8 of this Form 10-Q.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required toprovide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgradedbelow specific levels, primarily P-1, A-1 and F1 for Moody's,Standard & Poor'sand Fitch, respectively. The amount of these liquidity commitments was $43.1billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003; $31.0&nbsp;billion related to the Firm's multi-sellerconduits and structured commercial loan vehicles, further described in Note 8of this Form 10-Q, and the remaining $12.1&nbsp;billion related to vehiclesestablished by third parties. The total commercial paper outstanding for themulti-seller conduits and structured commercial loan vehicles was $21.2&nbsp;billionand $24.7&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, and December&nbsp;31, 2002, respectively. IfJPMorgan Chase Bank were required to provide funding under these commitments,the Firm could be replaced as liquidity provider. Additionally, for themulti-seller conduits and the structured commercial loan vehicles, JPMorganChase Bank could facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets in the SPE.All of these commitments are included in the Firm's total $187&nbsp;billion in otherunfunded commitments to extend credit, described in more detail in Note 21 ofthis Form 10-Q.51 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase's off-balance sheetlending-related financial instruments at June&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk profile as of June&nbsp;30,2003, focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should beread in conjunction with pages 45&#150;57 and pages 65&#150;66 and Notes 9, 10, 29 and 30of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.The Firm assesses its credit exposures on a managed basis, taking into accountthe impact of credit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of credit costson a managed, or operating, basis to reported results, see page 33 of this Form10-Q. The following table presents the Firm's managed credit-relatedinformation for the dates indicated.52 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;The following table presents a summary of managed credit-related informationfor the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's total credit exposure (including $34&nbsp;billion of securitizedcredit cards) totaled $584&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, a 3% increase from $568billion at year-end 2002. The growth reflected a 9% increase in managedconsumer loans and a 13% increase in derivative receivables, offset, in part,by a 4% decline in lending-related commitments and a modest decline incommercial loans.54 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO&nbsp;Total commercial exposure (loans, derivative receivables, unfundedlending-related commitments and Enron-related other receivables) was $414billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with $413&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002.Below are summaries of the maturity and risk profiles of the commercialportfolio as of June&nbsp;30, 2003 and December&nbsp;31, 2002. Ratings are based on theFirm's internal risk ratings, presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Includes all Enron-related credit exposures, inclusive of $108&nbsp;millionsubject to litigation with a credit-worthy entity.55 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The aggregate risk profile of the Firm's total commercial credit exposurecontinued to improve. The proportion of the total portfolio deemed investmentgrade increased from 80% at December&nbsp;31, 2002, to 83% at June&nbsp;30, 2003. Theincrease was largely driven by both the change in mix of the commercialportfolio, primarily derivative receivables and commercial loans, and by thecontinued improvement in the risk profile of all components of commercialcredit exposure.The investment-grade component of the commercial loan portfolio improved from55% at December&nbsp;31, 2002, to 62% at June&nbsp;30, 2003, and the derivativereceivables investment-grade component improved from 87% to 90% during the sameperiod. The investment-grade component of lending-related commitments improvedto 89% at June&nbsp;30, 2002. Concurrently, the noncriticized portion of thenoninvestment-grade portfolio declined by 14%, due to reductions inlending-related commitments and loans outstanding, which also contributed tothe overall improvement in the Firm's aggregate risk profile.&nbsp;Commercial Criticized ExposureThe criticized component (both performing and nonperforming) of totalcommercial exposure declined by 23%, or $3.7&nbsp;billion, during the first sixmonths of 2003, primarily as a result of successful restructurings of exposuresin merchant energy and related industries; criticized exposures to this sectordeclined by $1.5&nbsp;billion during the period. Reductions of $1.3&nbsp;billion across abroad number of other industries also contributed to the overall reduction incriticized exposure. In addition, criticized emerging markets exposuresdeclined by 75%, or $0.9&nbsp;billion, during the first six months of 2003 primarilydue to the improved creditworthiness of Brazil in the second quarter of 2003.The aggregate decline in criticized exposures during the first half of 2003included charge-offs of $549&nbsp;million.Total commercial nonperforming assets were $3.3&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, whichincluded $346&nbsp;million related to Enron. The $324&nbsp;million decline innonperforming assets for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, was largelydriven by charge-offs. Commercial loan net charge-offs for the three monthsended June&nbsp;30, 2003, were $257&nbsp;million, compared with $292&nbsp;million for thethree months ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, and $293&nbsp;million for the three months endedJune&nbsp;30, 2002. For the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, commercial loan netcharge-offs were $549&nbsp;million versus $613&nbsp;million for the six months ended June30, 2002. The charge-off ratio for commercial loans was 1.20% for the secondquarter of 2003, compared with 1.32% for the first quarter of 2003 and 1.17%for the second quarter of 2002.The Firm anticipates a continued improvement in commercial credit quality overthe remainder of the year. As a result, commercial charge-offs in 2003 are notanticipated to reach 2002 levels.56 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Credit Exposure Select Industry ConcentrationsThe Firm continues to focus on the management and diversification of itsindustry concentrations, with particular attention on exposures to industriesdeemed by the Firm to have higher levels of risk. A discussion of the Firm'sexposure to selected industries is set forth below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecom and Related IndustriesThe Firm continues to actively manage its exposure to this sector. Totalexposure declined 4% for the first six months of 2003. The investment-gradecomponent of the portfolio improved from 56% as of year-end 2002 to 67% as ofJune&nbsp;30, 2003, primarily as a result of the upgrade of one significantnoninvestment-grade client to investment-grade, and the Firm's strategy oftaking a selective approach to extending credit to clients in this sector.Criticized exposure to this sector declined by 8%, from $2.3&nbsp;billion atyear-end 2002, to $2.1&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, due to restructurings as wellas charge-offs of $123&nbsp;million during the first half of 2003.57 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CableThe decline of 14%, or $839&nbsp;million, in aggregate exposure in this portfolioduring the first six months of 2003 was largely driven by the repayment ofinvestment-grade exposures. This resulted in a reduction in theinvestment-grade component of the portfolio from $2.7&nbsp;billion to $1.9&nbsp;billionduring the first six months of 2003. Total criticized exposure of $2.3&nbsp;billionat June&nbsp;30, 2003, increased by 5% since year-end 2002.Merchant Energy & Related IndustriesAfter experiencing significant growth in the criticized component of thisportfolio during the last six months of 2002, the Firm reduced exposures deemedcriticized by 68%, or $1.5&nbsp;billion, during the first six months of 2003,through a combination of successful restructurings and collateralizations ofexposures. The noninvestment-grade, noncriticized component increased from 7%to 20% during the same period as a result of these actions. Concurrently, theinvestment-grade component of the portfolio also improved from 57% to 68%,driven largely by transactions with investment-grade entities.Trading assets are carried at fair value. Secured loans are performing and arereported on an amortized cost basis; unsecured, nonperforming loans have beenwritten down to reflect management's estimate of current recoverable value. The$108&nbsp;million in Other assets relates to a letter of credit that is the subjectof litigation with a creditworthy entity; it is being carried at its currentestimated realizable value in accordance with SFAS 5. Of the $94&nbsp;million inlending-related commitments, $75&nbsp;million relates to debtor-in-possessionfinancing.Derivative ContractsFor a further discussion of the derivative contracts utilized by JPMorgan Chasein connection with its trading and end-user activities, see Note 20 of thisForm 10-Q, and pages 50-53 and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and derivativereceivables (i.e., the mark-to-market or fair value of the derivative contractsafter taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;58 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The $29 trillion of notional principal of the Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at June&nbsp;30, 2003, does not represent, in the Firm's view, theactual credit losses that could arise from such transactions. For mostderivative transactions, the notional principal amount does not change hands;it is simply used as a reference to calculate payments. In the Firm's view, theappropriate measure of net current credit risk at June&nbsp;30, 2003, is $52billion, representing the $94&nbsp;billion mark-to-market (&#147;MTM&#148;) value ofderivative receivables (after taking into account the effects of legallyenforceable master netting agreements) less the $42&nbsp;billion of collateral heldby the Firm. This compares with net current credit exposure, at December&nbsp;31,2002, of $53&nbsp;billion. The $42&nbsp;billion of collateral excludes $9&nbsp;billiondelivered by clients at the initiation of transactions; this collateral securesexposure that could arise in the existing portfolio of derivatives should themark-to-market value of the client's transactions move in the Firm's favor. The$42&nbsp;billion of collateral also excludes credit enhancements in the form ofletters of credit and surety receivables.The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, of theFirm's Consolidated balance sheet exposure to derivative contracts, net of cashand other highly liquid collateral held by the Firm. Ratings below are basedupon the Firm's internal risk ratings and are presented on an S&P-equivalentbasis:&nbsp;While useful as a view of current credit exposure, the net MTM value of thederivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability ofthat credit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm measures, on aclient-by-client basis, both the worst-case, or peak, future credit exposure(at a 97.5% confidence level), as well as the expected credit exposure.However, the total potential future credit exposure embedded in the derivativesportfolio is not the simple sum of all peak or expected client exposure risks.This is because credit risk is reduced at the portfolio level when offsettingtransactions are entered into with separate counterparties; thus, only one ofthe two trades would generate a credit loss, even if both counterparties wereto default simultaneously. The Firm refers to this effect as marketdiversification.The Firm defines the &#147;market-diversified peak&#148; as the maximum loss (estimatedat the 97.5% confidence level) that would occur if all counterparties were todefault over a one-year time horizon with no recovery. The market-diversifiedpeak, after taking into account both collateral and netting, was approximately$56&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with $57&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002.As a general rule, since all counterparties will not default concurrently, norwill all default when their exposures are at peak levels, this is, in theFirm's view, a conservative measure of potential future derivatives creditrisk.Approximately two-thirds of the Firm's derivatives transactions at June&nbsp;30,2003, had associated collateral arrangements. The Firm held $42&nbsp;billion ofcollateral at June&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with $30&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002.These amounts exclude credit enhancements in the form of letters of credit andsurety receivables. The Firm posted $28&nbsp;billion of collateral at June&nbsp;30, 2003,compared with $19&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. Certain derivative andcollateral agreements include provisions that require both the Firm and thecounterparty, upon specified downgrades in their respective credit ratings, topost collateral for the benefit of the other party. The impact on requiredcollateral of a single-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, from itscurrent rating of AA- to A&#043;, would have been an additional $1.3&nbsp;billion ofcollateral as of June&nbsp;30, 2003. The impact of a six-notch ratings downgrade toJPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- to BBB-) would have been $3.7&nbsp;billion ofadditional collateral from current levels as of June&nbsp;30, 2003. Certainderivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generallyupon JPMorgan Chase Bank being downgraded, at the then-existing mark-to-marketvalue of the derivative receivables.59 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the notional amounts of credit derivativesprotection bought and sold at June&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;Credit derivatives activity&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase has modest counterparty exposure as a result of creditderivatives transactions. Of the $94&nbsp;billion of total derivative receivables atJune&nbsp;30, 2003, approximately $3&nbsp;billion, or 3%, was associated with creditderivatives, before the benefit of collateral. The use of derivatives to manageexposures does not reduce the reported level of assets on the Consolidatedbalance sheet or the level of reported off-balance sheet commitments.Portfolio management activityJPMorgan Chase's commercial credit portfolio is composed of credit exposures toclients arising from both lending and derivatives activities. In managing thisportfolio, single-name and portfolio credit derivatives are purchased by theCredit Portfolio Group to hedge these exposures. As of June&nbsp;30, 2003, thenotional outstanding amount of protection purchased via single-name andportfolio credit derivatives was $29&nbsp;billion and $2&nbsp;billion, respectively. TheFirm also diversifies its exposures by providing (i.e., selling) small amountsof credit protection, which increases exposure to industries or clients wherethe Firm has little or no client-related exposure. This activity is notmaterial to the Firm's overall credit exposure; and credit protection soldtotaled $429&nbsp;million in notional exposure at June&nbsp;30, 2003.JPMorgan Chase's use of credit derivatives for its portfolio managementactivities related to loans and lending-related commitments does not qualifyfor hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These derivatives are marked-to-market inTrading revenue. The mark-to-market (&#147;MTM&#148;) value incorporates both the cost ofhedge premiums and changes in value due to movement in spreads and creditevents, whereas the loans and lending-related commitments being hedged areaccounted for on an accrual basis in Net interest income. This asymmetry inaccounting treatment between loans and lending-related commitments and thecredit derivatives utilized in the portfolio management activities causesearnings volatility that is not representative of the true changes in value ofthe Firm's overall credit exposures. The MTM treatment of both the Firm'scredit derivative hedges (&#147;short&#148; credit positions) and the Credit ValuationAdjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;), which reflects the credit quality of derivativescounterparty exposure (&#147;long&#148; credit positions), provides some natural offset.The CVA is based on the expected future exposure (incorporating netting andcollateral) to a counterparty, and on the counterparty's credit derivativespread. The Firm manages components of the CVA by entering into creditderivative hedges and market risk derivative hedges (e.g. interest rate,foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivatives).Included in Trading revenue are losses of $355&nbsp;million in the second quarter of2003 related to credit derivatives that were used to hedge the Firm's creditexposure, of which approximately $167&nbsp;million was associated with creditderivatives used to hedge accrual lending activities. The $355&nbsp;million loss waslargely offset by $236&nbsp;million of trading revenue gains related to themark-to-market value of the CVA and corresponding market risk derivativehedges, resulting in a portfolio management activity net loss of $119&nbsp;million,driven by an overall global tightening of credit spreads. Since the secondquarter of 2002, the quarterly portfolio management activity performanceresults have ranged from a net loss of $119&nbsp;million, when credit spreadscontracted, to a net gain of $136&nbsp;million, in the second quarter of 2002, whencredit spreads widened. The CVA was $929&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2003, comparedwith $1.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002.60 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Dealer Client ActivityAs of June&nbsp;30, 2003, the total notional amounts of protection purchased andsold by the dealer business were $211&nbsp;billion and$218&nbsp;billion, respectively. The mismatch between these notional amounts isattributable to the Firm selling protection on large, diversified,predominantly investment-grade portfolios (including the most senior tranches)and then hedging these positions by buying protection on the more subordinatedtranches of the same portfolios. In addition, the Firm may use securities tohedge certain derivative positions. Consequently, while there is a mismatch innotional amounts of credit derivatives, in the Firm's view the risk positionsare largely matched. The amount of credit risk contributed by the Firm's creditderivatives dealer activity is immaterial in the context of JPMorgan Chase'soverall credit exposures.Country ExposureThe Firm has a comprehensive process for measuring and managing its countryexposures and risk. The table below presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure toselected countries. The selection of countries presented in the table below isbased on the materiality of the Firm's exposure and the dynamic creditconditions in a country as of the dates indicated. This disclosure is based onmanagement's view of country exposure. Exposure amounts are adjusted for creditenhancements (e.g., guarantees and letters of credit) provided by third partieslocated outside the country, if the enhancements fully cover both the countryrisk and the commercial risk. Exposures to a country include all credit-relatedlending, trading and investment activities, whether cross-border or locallyfunded. In addition, country exposure includes exposure to both government andprivate-sector entities in a country.During the first six months of 2003, the Firm's exposure to key selectedcountries remained relatively stable compared with year-end 2002. Exposureto Japan declined as a result of bond trading activities, although this type ofexposure may fluctuate in either direction in the normal course of business.Among the Firm's largest emerging markets country exposures, Hong Kong andKorea showed declines due to counterparty exposure, derivatives and bondtrading positions, while exposures to Mexico and Brazil remained largelyunchanged. Exposure to Saudi Arabia declined due to a reduction in loans.The following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CONSUMER PORTFOLIO&nbsp;&nbsp;62 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio continues to be primarily domestic and isgeographically well-diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfoliototaled $170.1&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003, an increase of $14.6&nbsp;billion sinceyear-end 2002. Consumer net charge-offs on a managed basis were $837&nbsp;millionand $862&nbsp;million for the second quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively, and$1.7&nbsp;billion and $1.6&nbsp;billion for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 and 2002,respectively. The increase in the year-to-date net charge-offs was primarilydue to an increase in credit card net charge-offs, from a higher level ofoutstandings. The Firm continues to anticipate higher charge-offs in itsconsumer loan portfolio in 2003 resulting from increases in loans outstanding.The following discussion relates to the specific loan categories within theconsumer portfolio:Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $75.0&nbsp;billion atJune&nbsp;30, 2003, an $11.0&nbsp;billion increase from the 2002&nbsp;year-end. The growth inthis portfolio was driven by new mortgage originations. Nonperforming 1-4family residential mortgage loans decreased $9&nbsp;million from year-end. The netcharge-off rate for the second quarter of 2003 decreased to 0.06% from 0.16% atthe second quarter of 2002. The net charge-off rate for the six months endedJune&nbsp;30, 2003 decreased to 0.05% from 0.12% for the same period of the prioryear. At June&nbsp;30, 2003, the Firm had $2.0&nbsp;billion of sub-prime residentialmortgage loans, of which $1.3&nbsp;billion were held for sale. At December&nbsp;31, 2002,sub-prime residential mortgage loans outstanding were $1.8&nbsp;billion, of which$1.3&nbsp;billion were held for sale.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the Consolidatedbalance sheet as well as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed consumer credit card receivables were $50.4&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003,flat relative to year-end 2002. During the 2003 second quarter, net charge-offsas a percentage of average credit card receivables decreased to 6.01%, comparedwith 6.42% for the second quarter of 2002. Loans over 90&nbsp;days past duedecreased to 2.03% of the portfolio at June&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with 2.14% atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. During the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, net charge-offrates as a percentage of average credit card receivables decreased to 5.97%compared with 6.15% in the same period of the prior year.Automobile Financings: Automobile financings outstanding increased by $4.5&nbsp;billion at June30, 2003, when compared with year-end 2002. This increase was driven byoriginations of $7.9&nbsp;billion during the second quarter of 2003, a 52% increaseover originations in the comparable period in 2002. The net charge-off rate of0.41% for the 2003 second quarter, compared with 0.43% for the 2002 secondquarter, continued to reflect the Firm's selective approach to assetorigination in this portfolio.Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans of $6.6&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003,decreased 12% compared with year-end levels. The net charge-off rate related tothis portfolio decreased for the second quarter of 2003 to 2.15%, from 2.35%for the second quarter of 2002. The net charge-off rate of 2.35% for the sixmonths ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, increased from 2.25% for the same period of theprior year, largely as a result of charge-offs in a discontinued installmentloan portfolio, as well as moderately higher charge-offs in the manufacturedhousing portfolio.Summary of changes in the Allowance for credit losses&nbsp;&nbsp;63 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Loans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of June&nbsp;30, 2003, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.The allowance has both specific and expected loss components and a residualcomponent. As of June&nbsp;30, 2003, management deemed the allowance to be adequate(i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but are not yetidentifiable). The allowance represented 2.24% of loans at June&nbsp;30, 2003,compared with 2.47% at year-end 2002. The allowance for loan losses declined by$263&nbsp;million from year-end 2002, compared with an increase of $81&nbsp;million fromJune&nbsp;30, 2002.The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $1.4&nbsp;billion atJune&nbsp;30, 2003, a decrease of $232&nbsp;million, or 14%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease was primarily attributable to charge-offs and restructuring ofexposures during the period.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $548&nbsp;million atJune&nbsp;30, 2003, a decrease of $65&nbsp;million, or 11%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease reflected a reduction in the amount, and an improvement in the averagequality, of the noncriticized portion of the portfolio.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.2&nbsp;billion at June30, 2003, a decline of $134&nbsp;million, or 6%, from year-end 2002. The decreasewas primarily attributable to the transfer of the allowance for accrued fees onsecuritized credit card loans to Other assets and a lower level of credit cardoutstandings.The residual component of the allowance was $942&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2003, anincrease of $168&nbsp;million from year-end 2002, and an increase of $100&nbsp;millionfrom March&nbsp;31, 2003. The residual component addresses the uncertaintiesinherent in the credit portfolio. At June&nbsp;30, 2003, the residual component represented approximately 19% of thetotal allowance for loan losses, which is within the Firm's target range ofbetween 10% and 20%.Lending-related commitments: To provide for the risk of loss inherent in theFirm's process of extending credit, management also computes specific andexpected loss components, as well as a residual component, for lending-relatedcommitments. These are computed using a methodology similar to that used forthe loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities ofdrawdown. This allowance, which is reported in Other liabilities, was $384million, $363&nbsp;million and $281&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2003, December&nbsp;31, 2002, andJune&nbsp;30, 2002, respectively. Although there was an improvement in the overallrisk profile of the portfolio during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, theallowance for lending-related commitments increased by$21&nbsp;million to $384&nbsp;million, due to the downgrade of select exposures in the portfolio. Forthe six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, there were no charge-offs oflending-related commitments.Capital Allocation for Credit RiskIn the second quarter of 2003, the Firm implemented a revised risk and capitalmeasurement methodology for the assessment of credit risk. The new approachemploys estimates of default likelihood that are derived from current marketparameters to capture the impact of both defaults and declines in market valuedue to credit deterioration. This approach is intended to reflect moreaccurately current market conditions, as well as to enhance the management ofcommercial credit risk, by encouraging the utilization of the growing marketsin credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales. See the CapitalManagement section on pages 49-50 of this Form 10-Q.64 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management processFor a discussion of the Firm's risk management process, see page 58 of the 2002Annual Report.Risk measurementValue-at-RiskJPMorgan Chase's statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the dollar amount ofpotential loss from adverse market moves in an ordinary market environment andprovides a consistent cross-business measure of risk profiles and levels ofrisk diversification. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensiveVAR calculation that includes its trading, investment and asset/liability(&#147;A/L&#148;) management activities. The Firm calculated the VAR numbers reportedbelow using a one-day time horizon and a 99% confidence level. This means theFirm would expect to incur losses greater than that predicted by VAR estimatesonly once every 100 trading days, or about 2.5 times a year. For the first sixmonths of 2003, there were no days on which actual Firm-wide marketrisk-related losses exceeded corporate VAR. For a further discussion of theFirm's VAR methodology, see pages 58-60 of the 2002 Annual Report.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thetable below provides a meaningful overview of the Firm's market risk exposurearising from trading activities and the investment and A/L portfolios.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The daily average Trading Portfolio VAR for the first six months of 2003 was$56.4&nbsp;million. The largest contributor was interest rate risk, which includescredit spread risk; before portfolio diversification, interest rate riskaccounted for 64% of the average VAR. The diversification effect, whichaveraged $(34.8) million in the first six months of 2003, reflects the factthat the largest losses for different positions and risks do not typicallyoccur at the same time. The risk of a portfolio of positions is thereforeusually less than the sum of the risks of the positions themselves. The degreeof diversification is determined both by the extent to which different marketvariables tend to move together and by the extent to which different businesseshave similar positions. The decline in average Trading Portfolio VAR since thefirst six months of 2002 was driven primarily by reduced position-taking ininterest rate businesses.VARs for the investment portfolio and A/L activities measure the amount ofpotential change in their economic value; however, they are not measures ofreported revenues, since those activities are not marked-to-market throughearnings. The increase in average VAR for the investment portfolio and A/Lactivities since the first six months of 2002 resulted primarily fromrefinements in measuring the spread between mortgage rates and Libor/swap ratesand increased exposure to increasing interest rates.HistogramThe histogram below illustrates the Firm's daily market risk-related revenue,defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-market trading portfoliosplus any trading-related Net interest income (&#147;NII&#148;), brokerage commissions,underwriting fees or other revenue. In the first half of 2003, JPMorgan Chaseposted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 123 out of 128&nbsp;days, with96&nbsp;days exceeding $25&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained on five of the 128&nbsp;daysrepresented in the histogram. There were no days on which losses exceeded $10million in the first half of 2003. The average daily market risk-relatedrevenue for the first half of 2003 was $49.1&nbsp;million.Six Months Ended June&nbsp;30, 2003To evaluate the soundness of its VAR model, the Firm conducts dailyback-testing of VAR against actual financial results, based on daily marketrisk-related revenue. The inset above examines the five days on which JPMorganChase posted trading losses and depicts the amount by which VAR was greaterthan the actual loss on each day. The inset shows that no losses exceeded VARon any of these days, a performance statistically consistent with the Firm's99% confidence level.66 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Stress TestingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. The Firm stress tests its portfolios at least once a month,at both the corporate and business segment levels, using multiple scenarios.Scenarios are continually reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the Firm'srisk profile and economic events. The following table represents the potentialeconomic value stress-test loss (pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfoliopredicted by the Firm's stress-test scenarios:&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that VAR results cannot be directly correlated tostress-test loss results for three reasons. First, stress-test losses arecalculated at varying dates each month, while VAR is performed daily andreported for the period-end date. Second, VAR and stress tests are two distinctrisk measurements yielding very different loss potentials. Although the sametrading portfolios are used for both tests, VAR is based on a distribution ofone-day historical losses measured over the most recent year; in contrast,stress testing subjects the portfolio to more extreme, larger moves over alonger time horizon (i.e., 2&#150;3&nbsp;weeks). Third, as VAR and stress tests aredistinct risk measurements, the impact of portfolio diversification can varygreatly. For VAR, markets can change in patterns over a one-year time horizon,moving from highly correlated to less so; in stress testing, the focus is on asingle event and the associated correlations in an extreme market situation. Asa result, while VAR over a given time horizon can be lowered by adiversification benefit in the portfolio, this benefit would not necessarilymanifest itself in stress-test scenarios, which assume large coherent movesacross all markets. For a further discussion of the Firm's stress-testmethodology, see pages 60&#150;61 of the 2002 Annual Report.The Firm conducts both economic-value and NII stress tests on its investmentportfolios and A/L activities, which are not accounted for on a mark-to-marketbasis. The more conventional NII stress test measures the potential change inthe Firm's NII over the next year. For the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003,JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NII stress-test loss was estimated at $235million, using a historical scenario that is a replay of the rate and spreadchanges that occurred in 1994. In 1994, the Federal Reserve tightened interestrates six times during the year, with a cumulative increase in the Federalfunds rate of 250 basis points, leading to a dramatic change in the U.S. dollaryield curve. The Firm also stresses NII for a 100 basis point rise ininterest rates, assuming a parallel shift in the yield curve. For thequarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, this NII stress test loss wasestimated at $122&nbsp;million. Economic-value stress tests measure the potential change in thevalue of the investment portfolios and asset and liability activitieswhich are not accounted for on a trading basis under the same scenarios used to evaluate the tradingportfolios. For the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, JPMorgan Chase's largestpotential economic-value stress-test loss on its investment portfolios and A/Lactivities was associated with a scenario that assumes a sharp widening incredit spreads and decreases in interest rates.Other statistical and nonstatistical risk measuresFor a discussion of the Firm's other risk measures, see page 61 of JPMorganChase's 2002 Annual Report.Capital allocation for market riskFor a discussion of the Firm's capital allocation for market risk, see page 61of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Risk monitoring and controlFor a discussion of the Firm's risk monitoring and control process, includinglimits, qualitative risk assessments, model review and policies and procedures,see page 62 of the 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The Firm implemented a new risk-based capital allocation methodology foroperational and business risks during the second quarter of 2003: operatingrisk has been separated into its two components, operational risk and businessrisk. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failedprocesses or systems, human factors or external events. Under the priormethodology, operating risk capital was allocated to each business based on itscomplexity, expense base and control quality. The new operational risk model isloss-based, with adjustments to reflect changes in the quality of the controlenvironment, and with a potential offset for the use of risk-transfer products.Business risk is defined as the risk associated with the volatility in theFirm's earnings due to factors not captured by other parts of the Firm'seconomic capital framework. For business risk, capital is allocated to eachbusiness based on historical revenue volatility and measures of fixed andvariable expenses. Earnings volatility arising from other risk factors, such ascredit, market or operational risks, is excluded from the measurement ofbusiness risk capital, as those factors are captured under those risk capitalmodels. The revised methodology resulted in an overall lower amount of capitalallocated to the lines of business with respect to operational and businessrisks. For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operational and business riskmanagement, refer to pages 63&#150;64 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.67 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The Firm refined its methodology for measuring private equity risk during thesecond quarter of 2003, and it has assigned a moderately higher amount ofcapital for the risk in the private equity portfolio. Most of the privateequity capital is assigned to JPMorgan Partners. For a discussion of JPMorganChase's private equity risk management, refer to page 65 of JPMorgan Chase's2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;SUPERVISION AND REGULATION&nbsp;The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1&#150;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Form 10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries could pay dividends to their respective bankholding companies, without the approval of their relevant banking regulators,in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These limitations, in the aggregate, totaledapproximately $3.8&nbsp;billion at June&nbsp;30, 2003.&nbsp;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM&nbsp;The Firm's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral tounderstanding reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimatesrequire management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets andliabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control proceduresintended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as partof such methods, are well controlled, independently reviewed and appliedconsistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and proceduresare intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in anappropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining thevaluation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. For a furtherdescription of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significantmanagement valuation judgments, see pages 65&#150;67 and the Notes to consolidatedfinancial statements in JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Allowance for Credit LossesThe Firm's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assignedto a loan. Assuming a one-notch downgrade in the Firm's internal risk ratingsfor all of its commercial loans, the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans would increase by approximately $650&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2003. Thissensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Thepurpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact that riskratings have on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans. It is not intended to imply management's expectation of futuredeterioration in risk ratings. Given the process the Firm follows indetermining risk ratings of its loans, management believes the current riskratings assigned to commercial loans are appropriate and the likelihood of aone-notch downgrade for all commercial loans is remote.Trading and Available-for-Sale portfoliosThe following table summarizes the Firm's trading and available-for-saleportfolios by valuation methodology at June&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE&nbsp;In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase trades nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts. To determine the fair value of these contracts, the Firmuses various fair value estimation techniques, which are primarily based oninternal models with significant observable market parameters. The Firm'snonexchange-traded commodity contracts are primarily energy-related contracts.The following table summarizes the changes in fair value for nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts for the first six months of 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table indicates the schedule of maturities of nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts at June&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS&nbsp;Consolidation of variable interest entitiesIn January&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued FIN 46. Entities that would be assessed forconsolidation under FIN 46 are typically referred to as Special-PurposeEntities (&#147;SPEs&#148;), although non-SPE-type entities may also be subject to theguidance. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by acompany if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from thevariable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of theentity's residual returns, or both. Effective February&nbsp;1, 2003, the Firmimplemented FIN 46 for variable interest entities created or modified afterJanuary&nbsp;31, 2003, in which the Firm has an interest.Effective July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Firm applied FIN 46 to entities originated prior toFebruary&nbsp;1, 2003, and increased the Firm's assets and liabilities byapproximately $20&nbsp;billion. The increase primarily related to multi-sellerconduits; CDOs and similar vehicles for which the Firm or its affiliates act asthe asset manager; and other entities in which the Firm's trading functionshave interests that absorb a majority of the expected loss. As of July&nbsp;1, 2003,the Firm had not restructured the multi-seller conduits, although it continuesto assess restructuring alternatives for these vehicles. The Firmwould alsodeconsolidate a limited number of vehicles as a result of the adoption of FIN46, primarily the wholly-owned Delaware statutory business trusts furtherdiscussed in Note 13 of this Form 10-Q and Note&nbsp;16 on pages 90&#150;91 of JPMorgan Chase's2002 Annual Report. The primary effect of deconsolidating thesevehicles would be achange in balance sheet classification of the liabilities from Guaranteedpreferred beneficial interests in the Firm's junior subordinated deferrableinterest debentures to Long-term debt. Based on interim guidanceissued by the Federal Reserve Board, the deconsolidation of these vehiclespursuant to FIN 46 would not impact the Tier 1 capital treatment of theliabilities.Due to the complexity of the new guidance and evolving interpretation amongaccounting professionals, the Firm continues to assess the accounting anddisclosure impact of FIN 46 on all of its relationships with variable interestentities; however, the implementation of FIN 46 did not have a material impacton the Firm's Consolidated balance sheet, earnings or capital resources. Forfurther details, see Note 8 of this Form 10-Q.69 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Accounting for trading derivativesIn October&nbsp;2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force concluded on Issue 02&#150;03,which, effective January&nbsp;1, 2003, precludes mark-to-market accounting forenergy-related contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative underSFAS 133 (i.e., transportation, storage or capacity contracts). The Firmimplemented this provision of EITF 02-03 effective January&nbsp;1, 2003;implementation had an immaterial effect on the Firm's Consolidated statement ofincome. In November&nbsp;2002, as part of the discussion of EITF 02&#150;03, the FASBstaff further confirmed their view that an entity should not recognize profitat the inception of a trade involving a derivative financial instrument in theabsence of: (a)&nbsp;quoted market prices in an active market, (b)&nbsp;observable pricesof other current market transactions or (c)&nbsp;other observable data supporting avaluation technique; the Firm implemented this provision on November&nbsp;21, 2002,and it has not had a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated statement ofincome.Derivative instruments and hedging activitiesIn April&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, which amends and clarifies accountingfor derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embeddedin other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. Specifically,SFAS 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial netinvestment meets the characteristic of a derivative, and when a derivativecontains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statementof cash flows. SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into ormodified after June&nbsp;30, 2003; its implementation is not expected to have amaterial impact on the Firm's Consolidated financial statements.Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of bothliabilities and equityIn May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, which establishes standards for how anissuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certainfinancial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Itrequires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within itsscope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances), because thatfinancial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. SFAS 150 iseffective immediately for all financial instruments entered into or modifiedafter May&nbsp;31, 2003, and is otherwise effective for the Firm's interim periodbeginning July&nbsp;1, 2003. The Firm does not anticipate that SFAS 150 will have amaterial impact on the Firm's Consolidated financial statements.70 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

JPMorgan Chase is involved in a number of lawsuits andinvestigations arising out of its banking relationships with Enron Corp. andits subsidiaries (&#147;Enron&#148;). Pending in London is a lawsuit by the Firm againstWestdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale seeking to compel payment of $165&nbsp;millionunder an Enron-related letter of credit issued by the bank.Actions involving Enron have also been initiated by other parties againstJPMorgan Chase, and its directors and certain of its officers. These lawsuitsinclude a series of purported class actions brought on behalf of shareholdersof Enron, including the lead action captioned Newby v. Enron Corp., and aseries of purported class actions brought on behalf of Enron employees whoparticipated in various employee stock ownership plans, including the leadaction captioned Tittle v. Enron Corp., both of which are pending in U.S.District Court in Houston. The consolidated complaint filed in Newby named asdefendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment bankingfirms, two law firms, Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities andindividuals and other individual80 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)defendants, including present and former officers and directors of Enron, andit purports to allege claims against JPMorgan Chase and the other defendantsunder federal and state securities laws. The Tittle complaint named asdefendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment bankingfirms, a law firm, Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities andindividuals and other individual defendants, including present and formerofficers and directors of Enron and purports to allege claims against JPMorganChase and certain other defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (&#147;RICO&#148;) and state common law. On December&nbsp;20, 2002, theCourt denied the motions of JPMorgan Chase and other defendants to dismiss theNewby action. Additional actions against JPMorgan Chase or its affiliatesrelating to Enron have been filed. These actions include a purportedconsolidated class action lawsuit by JPMorgan Chase stockholders alleging thatJPMorgan Chase issued false and misleading press releases and other publicdocuments relating to Enron in violation of Section 10(b) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 thereunder; shareholder derivative actionsalleging breaches of fiduciary duties and alleged failures to exercise due careand diligence by the Firm's directors and named officers in the management ofJPMorgan Chase; and various actions in disparate courts by Enron investors andcreditors alleging state law and common law claims against JPMorgan Chase andmany other defendants. By joint order of the district court handling Newby,Tittle and a number of other Enron-related cases and the bankruptcy courthandling Enron's bankruptcy case, a mediation among various investor andcreditor plaintiffs, the Enron bankruptcy estate and a number of financialinstitution defendants, including JPMorgan Chase, has been initiated before TheHonorable William C. Conner, Senior United States District Judge for theSouthern District of New York, and mediation sessions have been scheduled fordates in September and October&nbsp;2003.In addition, a number of federal, state and local regulatory and lawenforcement authorities and Congressional committees, and an examiner appointedin the Enron bankruptcy case, have initiated investigations of Enron and ofcertain of the Firm's financial transactions with Enron. In that regard, theFirm has delivered, voluntarily and pursuant to subpoena, information to variousCongressional committees, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;), theFederal Reserve Bank of New York (&#147;FRB&#148;), the New York State Banking Department(&#147;NYSBD&#148;), the New York County District Attorney's Office (&#147;NYDA&#148;), the U.S.Department of Justice and the Enron bankruptcy examiner.On July&nbsp;28, 2003, the Firm announced that it had reached agreements with theSEC, FRB, NYSBD and NYDA resolving matters relating to JPMorgan Chase'sinvolvement with certain transactions involving Enron. In connection with theSEC settlement, the SEC alleged that JPMorgan Chase aided and abetted a securities fraudby Enron. JPMorgan Chase has neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations but hasconsented to relief sought by the SEC, including an order enjoiningthe Firm fromfuture violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws andrequiring the Firm to pay a total of $135&nbsp;million, consisting of $65&nbsp;million ofdisgorgement of revenues,$5&nbsp;million of interest and $65&nbsp;million of penalties. The agreement with theNYDA provides that neither JPMorgan Chase nor any of its officers or employees will beprosecuted by the NYDA and that the Firm will pay a total of $27.5million, consisting of $25&nbsp;million in penalties and $2.5&nbsp;million inreimbursement of expenses of the NYDA. JPMorgan Chase has also committed to take certainmeasures to improve its handling of structured finance transactions. Theagreement with the FRB and NYSBD, a formal agreement, requires JPMorgan Chase to adoptprograms acceptable to the FRB and the NYSBD for enhancing the Firm's management ofcredit risk and legal and reputational risk, particularly in relation to itsparticipation in structured finance transactions. Also on July&nbsp;28, 2003, anexaminer appointed in the Enron bankruptcy case filed with the bankruptcy courtthe third in a series of reports. In this report, the Enron examiner opinedthat the Enron bankruptcy estate has colorable claims against (among others)JPMorgan Chase for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by certainof Enron's officers with respect to certain transactions involving Enron, forequitable subordination and for avoidance of approximately $275&nbsp;million inallegedly preferential payments made to the Firm. The report acknowledges thatany such claims may be subject to certain defenses which could be asserted byJPMorgan Chase.WorldCom litigation.J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (&#147;JPMSI&#148;) and JPMorgan Chasehave been named as defendants in more than 50 actions that were filed in eitherUnited States District Courts or state courts in 20 states and in one arbitralpanel beginning in July&nbsp;2002 arising out of alleged accounting irregularitiesin the books and records of WorldCom Inc. Plaintiffs in these actions areindividual and institutional investors, including state pension funds, whopurchased debt securities issued by WorldCom pursuant to public offerings in1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001. JPMSI acted as an underwriter of the 1998, 2000 and2001 offerings and was an initial purchaser in the December&nbsp;2000 private bondoffering. In addition to JPMSI, JPMorgan Chase and, in one action, J.P. MorganSecurities Ltd. (&#147;JPMSL&#148;) in its capacity as one of the underwriters of theinternational tranche of the 2001 offering, the defendants in various of theactions include other underwriters, certain executives of WorldCom andWorldCom's auditors. In the actions, plaintiffs allege that defendants eitherknew or were reckless or negligent in not knowing that the securities were soldto plaintiffs on the basis of misrepresentations and omissions of materialfacts concerning the financial condition of WorldCom. The complaints againstJPMorgan Chase, JPMSI and JPMSL assert claims under federal and statesecurities laws, other state statutes and under common law theories of fraudand negligent misrepresentation.Commercial Financial Services litigation. JPMSI (formerly known as ChaseSecurities, Inc.) has been named as a defendant in 13 actions that were filedin or transferred to the United States District and Bankruptcy Courts for theNorthern District of Oklahoma or filed in Oklahoma state court beginning inOctober&nbsp;1999, arising out of the failure of Commercial Financial Services, Inc.(&#147;CFSI&#148;). Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchasedmore than $2.0&nbsp;billion in original face amount of asset-backed securitiesissued by CFSI. The securities were backed by delinquent credit cardreceivables. In addition to JPMSI, the defendants in81 &nbsp;Part&nbsp;IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)various of the actions are the founders and key executives of CFSI, as well asits auditors and outside counsel. JPMSI is alleged to have been the investmentbanker to CFSI and to have acted as an initial purchaser and as placement agentin connection with the issuance of certain of the securities. Plaintiffs allegethat defendants either knew or were reckless in not knowing that the securitieswere sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleading misrepresentations andomissions of material facts. The complaints against JPMSI assert claims underthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, under the Oklahoma Securities Act andunder common law theories of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. In theactions against JPMSI, damages in the amount of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion,allegedly suffered as a result of defendants' misrepresentations and omissions,plus punitive damages, are being claimed. CFSI has commenced an action againstJPMSI in Oklahoma state court and has asserted claims against JPMSI forprofessional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. CFSI alleges that JPMSIfailed to detect and prevent its insolvency. CFSI seeks unspecified damages.CFSI has also commenced, in its bankruptcy case, an adversary proceedingagainst JPMSI and its credit card affiliate, Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A.,alleging that certain payments, aggregating $78.4&nbsp;million, made in connectionwith CFSI's purchase of charged-off credit card receivables were constructivefraudulent conveyances, and seeks to recover such payments.IPO allocation litigation. Beginning in May&nbsp;2001, JPMorgan Chase and certain ofits securities subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous other firms inthe securities industry, as defendants in a large number of putative classaction lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of New York. These suits purport to challenge alleged improprieties inthe allocation of stock in various public offerings, including some offeringsfor which a JPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. The suits allegeviolations of securities and antitrust laws arising from alleged materialmisstatements and omissions in registration statements and prospectuses for theinitial public offerings and alleged market manipulation with respect toaftermarket transactions in the offered securities. The securities claimsallege, among other things, misrepresentations and proposed market manipulationof the aftermarket trading for these offerings by tying allocations of sharesin IPOs to undisclosed excessive commissions paid to JPMorgan Chase and torequired aftermarket purchase transactions by customers who receivedallocations of shares in the respective initial public offerings, as well asallegations of misleading analyst reports. The antitrust claims allege anillegal conspiracy to require customers, in exchange for initial publicoffering allocations, to pay undisclosed and excessive commissions and to makeaftermarket purchases of the initial public offering securities at a pricehigher than the offering price as a precondition to receiving allocations. OnFebruary&nbsp;13, 2003, the Court denied the motions of JPMorgan Chase and others todismiss the securities complaints. JPMorgan Chase also has received varioussubpoenas and informal requests from governmental and other agencies seekinginformation relating to initial public offering allocation practices. OnFebruary&nbsp;20, 2003, the National Association of Securities Dealers (&#147;NASD&#148;)censured JPMSI and fined it $6&nbsp;million for activities it found to constituteunlawful profit sharing by Hambrecht & Quist Group in the period immediatelyprior to and following its acquisition in 2000. In agreeing to the resolutionof the charges, JPMSI neither admitted nor denied the NASD's contentions. JPMSIhas been advised by the SEC that it is also considering bringing a disciplinaryaction against JPMSI. JPMSI has submitted to the staff of the SEC a letteroutlining the basis for JPMSI's position that no such action is warranted andis currently in discussions with the SEC.Research analysts' conflicts. On December&nbsp;20, 2002, the Firm reached anagreement in principle with the SEC, the NASD, the New York StockExchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;), theNew York State Attorney General's Office and the North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association, on behalf of state securities regulators, toresolve their investigations of JPMorgan Chase relating to research analystindependence. Pursuant to the agreement in principle, JPMorgan Chase willagree, among other things: (i)&nbsp;to pay $50&nbsp;million for retrospective relief,(ii)&nbsp;to adopt internal structural and operational reforms that will furtheraugment the steps it has already taken to ensure the integrity of JPMorganChase analyst research, (iii)&nbsp;to contribute $25&nbsp;million spread over five yearsto provide independent third-party research to clients and (iv)&nbsp;to contribute$5&nbsp;million towards investor education. Mutually satisfactory settlementdocuments have been negotiated and approved by the SEC, the NYSE, the NASD andthe Texas State Securities Board. In due course, it is anticipated thatmutually satisfactory settlement documents will be negotiated in the remainingstates. They must be approved by state regulatory authorities.JPMSI has been named as a co-defendant with nine other broker-dealers in twoactions involving allegations similar to those at issue in the regulatoryinvestigations: a putative class action filed in federal court in Coloradoseeking an unspecified amount of money damages for alleged violations offederal securities laws, and an action filed in West Virginia state court byWest Virginia's Attorney General seeking recovery from the defendants in theaggregate of $5,000 for each of what are alleged to be hundreds of thousands ofviolations of the state's consumer protection statute. OnAugust&nbsp;8, 2003, the plaintiffs in the Colorado action dismissedthe complaint without prejudice.JPMSI was served by the SEC on or about May&nbsp;30, 2003, with a subpoena seekinginformation regarding certain present and former officers and employees inconnection with a follow-up to the regulatory investigations, this timefocusing on whether particular individuals properly performed supervisoryfunctions regarding domestic equity research. At or about the same time,document requests identical to the SEC subpoena were served on JPMSI by theNASD and the NYSE, which are conducting the follow-up investigation jointlywith the SEC.
