>Level 3 analysisConsolidated balance sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 1.7%&#32;of total Firm assets at June 30, 2015. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2014, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 100.Three months ended June 30, 2015Level 3 assets were $40.6 billion&#32;at June 30, 2015, reflecting a decrease of $5.4 billion&#32;from March 31, 2015, largely due to the following:Six months ended June 30, 2015 Level 3 assets were $40.6 billion&#32;at June 30, 2015, reflecting a decrease of $8.6 billion&#32;from December 31, 2014, largely due to the following:&nbsp;Gains and lossesThe following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 95&#8211;99.Three months ended June 30, 2015Three months ended June 30, 2014Six months ended June 30, 2015Six months ended June 30, 201499Credit & funding adjustmentsThe following table provides the credit and funding adjustments, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities, reflected within the Consolidated balance sheets as of the dates indicated.The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. &nbsp;Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis At June 30, 2015&#32;and 2014, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $2.0 billion&#32;and $3.4 billion, respectively, which predominantly consisted of loans that had fair value adjustments in the first six months of both 2015 and 2014. At June 30, 2015, $94 million&#32;and $1.9 billion&#32;of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At June 30, 2014, $597 million&#32;and $2.8 billion&#32;of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at June 30, 2015&#32;and 2014. For the three and six months ended&#32;June 30, 2015&#32;and 2014, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $1.9 billion&#32;of level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of June 30, 2015:The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months ended June 30, 2015&#32;and 2014, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $114 million&#32;and $318 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, was a reduction of $183 million&#32;and $456 million, respectively.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.100Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair valueThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.101The majority of the Firm's lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, see page 182 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Note 4 &#8211; Fair value option For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was previously elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015&#32;and 2014, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.102103Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.At June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.4 billion&#32;and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(130) million&#32;and $(147) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report, and Note 21.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe table below presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk to which the structured notes' embedded derivative relates.104Note 5 &#8211; Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The Firm's disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm's derivatives are designated in hedge &nbsp;accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm's market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm's primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.105Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm's derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.106Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.107The following table presents, as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the gross and net derivative receivables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets against derivative payables and cash collateral payables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the receivables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.108The following table presents, as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the gross and net derivative payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative payables have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets against derivative receivables and cash collateral receivables from the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the payables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.109In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with net derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm's derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is comprised of &nbsp;non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.The following tables present information regarding certain financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the derivative instruments for which appropriate legal opinions have been obtained; excluded are (i) additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and (ii) all collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.&#32;Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresFor a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm's derivative contracts, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.&nbsp;The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.110The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), at June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and December&#160;31, 2014, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial assetIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer.&#160;The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 12, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding at June 30, 2015 was not material.Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of incomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.111Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.112In the first quarter of 2015, the Firm reclassified approximately $150 million&#32;of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) to other income because the Firm determined that it was probable that the forecasted interest payment cash flows would not occur as a result of the planned reduction in wholesale non-operating deposits. The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, and six months ended June 30, 2014.&nbsp;Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $64 million&#32;(after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at June&#160;30, 2015, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For terminated cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are remaining is approximately 9 years. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 3 years. The Firm's longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.113Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, AFS securities, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&nbsp;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm's market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. 114Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes115The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings and maturity profile, and the total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, where JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.116Note 6 &#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note 7 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm's client-driven market-making activities.&#160;See Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.&nbsp;The following table presents the components of firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.Other incomeOther income on the Firm's Consolidated statements of income included the following:117Note 7 &#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note 8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.118Note 8 &#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, see Note 9 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.6 billion&#32;and $3.7 billion, as of June 30, 2015, and $16.5 billion&#32;and $3.7 billion&#32;respectively, as of December 31, 2014. See Note 19 for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three months periods ended June 30, 2015&#32;and 2014.&nbsp;The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2015&#32;at this time. For 2015, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $33 million. The 2015&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $47 million&#32;and $2 million, respectively.119Note 9 &#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.In the first quarter of 2015, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2014 performance year, the Firm granted 34 million&#32;RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $55.91&#32;per RSU.&nbsp;Note 10 &#8211; Noninterest expenseWithin noninterest expense on the Firm's Consolidated statements of income, other expense included the following:120Note 11 &#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as trading, AFS or held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;). Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 3. Predominantly all of the Firm's AFS and HTM investment securities (the &#8220;investment securities portfolio&#8221;) are held by the Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At June 30, 2015, the average credit rating of the debt &nbsp;securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+&#32;(based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.121Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.122Gross unrealized lossesThe Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of June 30, 2015, the Firm does not intend to sell any securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2015.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.123Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at June 30, 2015, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.124Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesJPMorgan Chase enters into resale agreements, repurchase agreements, securities borrowed transactions and securities loaned transactions (collectively, &#8220;securities financing agreements&#8221;) primarily to finance the Firm's inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions, accommodate customers' financing needs, and settle other securities obligations.Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets. Resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. For further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities, see Note 1. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. For further information regarding the fair value option, see Note 4. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements; securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements; and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions &nbsp;revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.Secured financing transactions expose the Firm to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and agency MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.In resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent the value of the securities received is less than initial cash proceeds and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities exceeds the value of the initial cash proceeds and, any collateral amounts exchanged.Additionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm's policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions.The following table presents as of June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the gross and net securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated balance sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities borrowed are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.125The following table presents information as of June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, regarding the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement. The table below excludes information related to resale agreements and securities borrowed where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.The following table presents as of June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned. Securities sold under repurchase agreements have been presented on the Consolidated balance sheets net of securities purchased under resale agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities sold under repurchase agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities loaned are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.126The following table presents information as of June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, regarding the securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement. The table below excludes information related to repurchase agreements and securities loaned where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.Effective April 1, 2015, the Firm adopted new accounting guidance, which requires enhanced disclosures with respect to the types of financial assets pledged in secured financing transactions and the remaining contractual maturity of the secured financing transactions; the following tables present this information as of June 30, 2015.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt June 30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm held $11.5 billion&#32;and $13.8 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on theConsolidated balance sheets.127Note 13 &#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report. See Note 4 of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:128The following tables summarize the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.The following table provides information about gains and losses, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, on loan sales by portfolio segment.129Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.&nbsp;The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.130Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.131The following table represents the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.&nbsp;Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm's delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.132The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Loan modificationsThe Firm is required to provide borrower relief under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This borrower relief includes reductions of principal and forbearance.Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm.133Nature and extent of modificationsMaking Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;), as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.134Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the Firm's loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications. These tables also exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.At June&#160;30, 2015, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6&#32;years for senior lien home equity, 8&#32;years for junior lien home equity, 9&#32;years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8&#32;years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $1.3 billion&#32;and $1.5 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.135Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.136Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.&#160;See Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.The following table provides information about the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material for the three and six months ended June&#160;30, 2015 and 2014.137Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.138Approximately 20%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.&nbsp;The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the three and six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and 2014, and represents the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option adjustable-rate mortgage (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.Active and suspended foreclosureAt June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $2.7 billion&#32;and $3.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.139Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's credit card loans.Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;At June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, $127 million&#32;and $159 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $78 million&#32;and $95 million&#32;at June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60&#32;months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs.&#160;New enrollments in these loan modification programs were $151 million&#32;and $193 million, for the three months ended June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and 2014, respectively, and $329 million&#32;and $426 million&#32;for the six months ended&#32;June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and 2014, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for credit card loans modified was expected to be 26.45%and 27.91%&#32;as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively.140Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note 14 and Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.141Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans are comprised of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.&nbsp;Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. TDRs were not material as of June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and 2014.142Note 14 &#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.143Note 15 &#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;), see Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 147&#32;of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm's primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 148&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including student loans) primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm's involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.144The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 149&#32;of this Note for further information regarding the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and page 149&#32;of this Note for information on the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies.145Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.At June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 148&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report. See the table on page 148&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase'sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.During the three months ended June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and 2014, the Firm transferred $6.3 billion&#32;and $8.0 billion&#32;respectively of securities to agency VIEs, and $255 million&#32;and $264 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.During the six months ended June&#160;30, 2015&#32;and 2014, the Firm transferred $10.2 billion&#32;and $13.3 billion&#32;respectively of securities to agency VIEs, and $727 million&#32;and $433 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm consolidated $50 million&#32;and $77 million, respectively, of assets, and $3 million&#32;and $21 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 148&#32;of this Note for more information on consolidated re-securitization transactions.&nbsp;As of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $2.5 billion&#32;and $2.9 billion, respectively. At June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm held approximately $3.3 billion&#32;and $2.4 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $31 million&#32;and $36 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities.

The Firm held $3.6 billion&#32;and $5.7 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. The Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm to the multi-seller conduits have been eliminated in consolidation. Unfunded lending-related commitments made to clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits were $9.9 billion&#32;at both June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.146The Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, was as follows.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.&nbsp;VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs sponsored by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.147Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of June&#160;30, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.Loan securitizationsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans. For a &nbsp;further description of the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.148Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to the Firm's securitization activities for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Freddie Mac.Loans and excess MSRs sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the &#8220;GSEs&#8221;). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying any of the transactions described above as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 for additional information about the impact of the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs. The following table &nbsp;summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.149Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding &nbsp;liability. As of June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated balance sheets $11.7 billion&#32;and $12.4 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $385 million&#32;and $464&#160;million&#32;as of June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 13 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of June 30, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.150<hr
