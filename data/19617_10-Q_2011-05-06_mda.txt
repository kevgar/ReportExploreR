Table of ContentsChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts (including changes in fairvalue) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010. When a determination is made to classify afinancial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of theunobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financialinstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observablecomponents (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part toobservable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages theobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positionsthat are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables donot reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3instruments.98 Table of Contents99 Table of Contents100 Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value ona nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but aresubject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there isevidence of impairment). The following tables present the assets and liabilities carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheets by caption and level within the valuation hierarchy as of March&nbsp;31,2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, for which a nonrecurring change in fair value has been recorded duringthe reporting period.The method used to estimate the fair value of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and otherloans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g.,residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), depends on the typeof collateral (e.g., securities, real estate, nonfinancial assets) underlying the loan. Fair valueof the collateral is estimated based on quoted market prices, broker quotes or independentappraisals, or by using a discounted cash flow model. For further information, see Note 14 on pages139&#150;140 of this Form 10-Q.101 Table of ContentsNonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which a fairvalue adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three-monthperiods ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, related to financial instruments held at those dates.Level 3 analysisLevel 3 assets at March&nbsp;31, 2011, predominantly include derivative receivables, mortgage servicingrights (&#147;MSRs&#148;), collateralized loan obligations (&#147;CLOs&#148;) held within the AFS securities portfolio,trading loans, asset-backed trading securities and private equity investments.Consolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 5% of totalFirm assets at March&nbsp;31, 2011. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets duringthe quarter.102 Table of ContentsFor the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011Level 3 assets were $116.1&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2011, reflecting an increase of $1.3&nbsp;billionlargely by:Gains and LossesIncluded in the tables for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011Included in the tables for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2010Credit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument, it may be necessary to record a valuationadjustment to arrive at an exit price under U.S. GAAP. Valuation adjustments include, but are notlimited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm's own creditworthiness. Themarket's view of the Firm's credit quality is reflected in credit spreads observed in the creditdefault swap market. For a detailed discussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm considers, seeNote 3 on pages 170&#150;187 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.The following table provides the credit adjustments, excluding the effect of any hedging activity,reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments on earnings in the respectiveperiods, excluding the effect of any hedging activity.Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments (including financialinstruments not carried at fair value)The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial assets andliabilities. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope ofthis disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, seeNote 3 on pages 170&#150;187 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.103 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of financial assets andliabilities.The majority of the Firm's unfunded lending-related commitments are not carried at fair valueon a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carryingvalue and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending&#150;related commitments were as followsfor the periods indicated.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending&#151;related commitments. In manycases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower prior notice or,in some cases, without notice as permitted by law. For a further discussion of the valuation oflending-related commitments, see Note 3 on pages 171&#150;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.104 Table of ContentsTrading assets and liabilities &#151; average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.NOTE 4 &#151; FAIR VALUE OPTION For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option waspreviously elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination ofinstrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note 4 on pages 187&#150;189 of JPMorgan Chase's2010 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements ofIncome for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, for items for which the fair valueelection was made. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financialinstruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments,which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.105 Table of ContentsDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balanceoutstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregateremaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010,for , long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option hasbeen elected.At both March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, the contractual amount of letters of credit forwhich the fair value option elected was $3.8&nbsp;billion, with a corresponding fair value of $6million. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments,see Note 30 on pages 275&#150;280 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.106 Table of ContentsNOTE 5 &#151; DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS For a further discussion of the Firm's use and accounting policies regarding derivativeinstruments, see Note 6 on pages 191&#150;199 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of March31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm'sderivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possiblelosses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notionalamount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.107 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following tables summarize information on derivative fair values that are reflected on theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, by accountingdesignation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated as hedges or not) and contract type.Free-standing derivatives(a)Derivative receivables and payables fair valueThe following table summarizes the fair values of derivative receivables and payables, includingthose designated as hedges by contract type after netting adjustments as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2010.108 Table of ContentsImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of IncomeFair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedgeaccounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and therelated hedged items for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Firmincludes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line itemin the Consolidated Statements of Income.109 Table of ContentsCash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedgeaccounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the threemonths ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on thehedging derivative in the same line item as the offsetting change in cash flows on the hedged itemin the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, the Firm expects that $159&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin AOCI at March&nbsp;31, 2011, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximumlength of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and such transactionsprimarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in netinvestment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on suchinstruments for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010.110 Table of ContentsRisk management derivatives gains and losses (not designated as hedging instruments)The following table presents nontrading derivatives, by contract type, that were not designated inhedge relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives for the threemonths ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010. These derivatives are risk management instruments used tomitigate or transform the market risk exposures arising from banking activities other than tradingactivities, which are discussed separately below.Trading derivative gains and lossesThe following table presents trading derivatives gains and losses, by contract type, that arerecorded in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the threemonths ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010. The Firm has elected to present derivative gains and lossesrelated to its trading activities together with the cash instruments with which they are riskmanaged.Credit risk, liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresThe aggregate fair value of net derivative payables that contain contingent collateral ortermination features triggered upon a downgrade was $16.3&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2011, for which theFirm has posted collateral of $11.4&nbsp;billion in the normal course of business. At March&nbsp;31, 2011,the impact of a single-notch and two-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and itssubsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#147;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#148;),would have required $1.9&nbsp;billion and $3.2&nbsp;billion, respectively, of additional collateral to beposted by the Firm. In addition, at March&nbsp;31, 2011, the impact of single-notch and two-notchratings downgrades to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, primarily JPMorgan Chase Bank,N.A., related to contracts with termination triggers would have required the Firm to settle tradeswith a fair value of $382&nbsp;million and $1.1&nbsp;billion, respectively.The following tables show the carrying value of derivative receivables and payables after nettingadjustments and collateral received as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010.111 Table of ContentsIn addition to the collateral amounts reflected in the tables above, at March&nbsp;31, 2011, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm had received liquid securities and other cash collateral in the amountof $16.2&nbsp;billion and $16.5&nbsp;billion, respectively, and had posted liquid securities and other cashcollateral in the amount of $10.2&nbsp;billion and $10.9&nbsp;billion, respectively. The Firm also receivesand delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions, which is available assecurity against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactionsmove, respectively, in the Firm's or client's favor. Furthermore, the Firm and its counterpartieshold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to beposted, and collateral that the Firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settledas of the reporting date. At March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm had received $20.5billion and $18.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, and delivered $7.6&nbsp;billion and $8.4&nbsp;billion, respectively,of such additional collateral. These amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables andpayables in the tables above, because, at an individual counterparty level, the collateral exceededthe fair value exposure at both March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010.Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, including a description of the differenttypes used by the Firm, see Note 6 on pages 191&#150;199 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010. Upona credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of thefull notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on thecontracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time ofsettlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasingprotection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protectionreferenced in the following tables include credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical,reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well asprotection purchased through credit-related notes.The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of riskmanagement for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account theprobability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, orrelated cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view, the risksassociated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes112 Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize the notional and fair value amounts of credit derivatives andcredit-related notes as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, where JPMorgan Chase is theseller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of thecredit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity onwhich the credit derivative contract is based.

For the full year 2011, the cost of funding benefits underthe Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $42&nbsp;million. The2011 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $166million and $2&nbsp;million, respectively.NOTE 9 &#151; EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED INCENTIVES For a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-basedincentives, see Note 10 on pages 210&#150;212 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employeestock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.In the first quarter of 2011, in connection with its annual incentive grant, the Firm granted55&nbsp;million RSUs and 14&nbsp;million SARs with weighted-average grant date fair values of $44.31 per RSUand $13.12 per SAR.NOTE 10 &#151; NONINTEREST EXPENSE The following table presents the components of noninterest expense.115 Table of ContentsNOTE 11 &#151; SECURITIES Securities are classified as AFS, held-to-maturity (&#147;HTM&#148;) or trading.

Trading securities are discussed in Note 3 on pages 94&#150;105 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and credit losses that were recognized inincome from AFS securities.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of AFS and HTM securities were as follows for thedates indicated.116 Table of ContentsSecurities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for AFS securities by agingcategory at March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010.117 Table of ContentsOther-than-temporary impairment (&#147;OTTI&#148;)The following table presents credit losses that are included in the securities gains and lossestable above.Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, ofthe credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income, related to debtsecurities that the Firm does not intend to sell.Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally increased since December&nbsp;31, 2010. As of March&nbsp;31, 2011, theFirm does not intend to sell the securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely thatthe Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognizedin income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are notother-than-temporarily impaired as of March&nbsp;31, 2011.Following is a description of the Firm's principal security investments with the most significantunrealized losses that have been existing for 12&nbsp;months or more as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and the keyassumptions used in the Firm's estimate of the present value of the cash flows most likely to becollected from these investments.Mortgage-backed securities &#151; Prime and Alt-A nonagencyAs of March&nbsp;31, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to prime and Alt-A residentialmortgage-backed securities issued by private issuers were $173&nbsp;million, all of which related tosecurities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12&nbsp;months or more. Approximately 57%of the total portfolio (by amortized cost) are currently rated below investment- grade; the Firmhas recorded OTTI losses on 67% of the below investment-grade positions. In analyzing prime andAlt-A residential mortgage-backed securities for potential credit losses, the Firm utilizes amethodology that focuses on loan-level detail to estimate future cash flows, which are thenallocated to the various tranches of the securities. The loan-level analysis primarily considerscurrent home value, loan-to-value (&#147;LTV&#148;) ratio, loan type and geographical location of theunderlying property to forecast prepayment, home price, default rate and loss severity. Theforecasted weighted average underlying default rate on the positions was 24% and the relatedweighted average loss severity was 49%. Based on this analysis, an OTTI loss of $30&nbsp;million wasrecognized for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011, on certainsecurities related to higher defaultrate assumptions, partially offset by lower loss severities. Overall unrealized losses havedecreased since December&nbsp;31, 2010, as a result of the recovery in security prices due to increaseddemand for higher-yielding asset classes and a deceleration in the pace of home price declines duein part to the U.S. government programs to facilitate financing and to spur home purchases. Theunrealized loss of $173&nbsp;million is considered temporary, based on management's assessment that theestimated future cash flows together with the credit enhancement levels for those118 Table of Contentssecurities remain sufficient to support the Firm's investment. The credit enhancements associatedwith the below investment-grade and investment-grade positions are 9% and 43%, respectively.Asset-backed securities &#151; Collateralized loan obligationsAs of March&nbsp;31, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to CLOs were $172&nbsp;million, of which $167million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12&nbsp;months or more.Overall losses have decreased since December&nbsp;31, 2010, mainly as a result of lower defaultforecasts and spread tightening across various asset classes. Substantially all of these securitiesare rated &#147;AAA,&#148; &#147;AA&#148; and &#147;A&#148; and have an average credit enhancement of 30%. Credit enhancement inCLOs is primarily in the form of subordination, which is a form of structural credit enhancementwhere realized losses associated with assets held in an issuing vehicle are allocated to thevarious tranches of securities issued by the vehicle considering their relative seniority. The keyassumptions considered in analyzing potential credit losses were underlying loan and debt securitydefaults and loss severity. Based on current default trends, the Firm assumed collateral defaultrates of 2.1% for the first quarter 2011, and 5% thereafter. Further, loss severities were assumedto be 48% for loans and 82% for debt securities. Losses on collateral were estimated to occurapproximately 18&nbsp;months after default.119 Table of ContentsContractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March&nbsp;31, 2011, ofJPMorgan Chase's AFS and HTM securities by contractual maturity.120 Table of ContentsNOTE 12 &#151; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES For a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 onpage 219 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.

Thistable excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore does not represent net interestincome expected to be earned on these portfolios.&nbsp;The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to becollected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i)&nbsp;changes in the benchmarkinterest rate indices for variable rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii)changes in prepayment assumptions.Since the date of purchase, the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarilyrelated to a decrease in interest rates on variable-rate loans and, to a lesser extent, extendedloan liquidation periods. Certain events, such as extended loan liquidation periods, affect thetiming of expected cash flows but not the amount of cash expected to be received (i.e., theaccretable yield balance). Extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentagebecause the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balanceover a longer-than-expected period of time.136 Table of ContentsCredit card loansThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm,including those acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction. Delinquency rates are the primarycredit quality indicator for credit card loans. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographicdistribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on theregional economy.The borrower's credit score is another general indicator of credit quality. Because the creditscore tends to be a lagging indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not use credit scores as aprimary indicator of credit quality. For more information on credit quality indicators, see Note 14on pages 220&#150;238 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report. The Firm generally originates new cardaccounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders' refreshed FICO scores maychange over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in credit scoretechnology.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's Credit Card loans.&nbsp;137 Table of ContentsCredit card impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications,see Note 14 on pages 220&#151;238 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.The tables below set forth information about the Firm's impaired credit card loans.

This includes the Firm'sprimary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. The Firm consolidated $58.4&nbsp;billion and$68.5&nbsp;billion of assets held by Firm-administered credit-card securitization trusts and $37.7billion and $44.3&nbsp;billion of beneficial interests issued to third parties at March&nbsp;31, 2011, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2010, respectively.The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets are available only for paymentof the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay theFirm's other obligations or the claims of the Firm's other creditors.Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsFor a detailed description of the Firm's involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and othersecuritization trusts, as well as accounting treatment, see Note 16 on page 246 of JPMorgan Chase's2010 Annual Report.The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in JPMorganChase&#151;sponsored securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement, includingthose that are consolidated or not consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includesservicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guaranteearrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuinginvolvement is servicing the loans. In the table below, the amount of beneficial interests held byJPMorgan Chase does not equal the assets held in nonconsolidated VIEs because of the existence ofbeneficial interests held by third parties, which are reflected at their current outstanding paramounts; and because a portion of the Firm's retained interests (trading assets and AFS securities)are reflected at their fair values. See Securitization activity on pages 146&#151;148 of this Note forfurther information regarding the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidatedVIEs.141 Table of Contents&nbsp;142 Table of ContentsRe-securitizationsThe Firm also engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities aretransferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur to both agency(Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) and nonagency (private-label) sponsored VIEs, which may bebacked by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients.As of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm did not consolidate any agencyre-securitizations, as it did not have the power to direct the significant activities of the trust.As of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, respectively, the Firm consolidated $387&nbsp;million and$477&nbsp;million of assets, and $167&nbsp;million and $230&nbsp;million of liabilities of private-labelre-securitizations, as the Firm had both the power to direct the significant activities of, andretained an interest that is deemed to be significant in, the trust. For other nonconsolidatedprivate-label re-securitizations, the Firm shares control over the resecuritization VIEs (i.e.,established the VIE jointly with the investors) and therefore did not have unilateral ability todirect the significant activities of the entity. During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and2010, the Firm transferred $8.8&nbsp;billion and $6.5&nbsp;billion, respectively, of securities to agencyVIEs, and $192&nbsp;million and $383&nbsp;million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs. AtMarch&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Firm held approximately $2.8&nbsp;billion and $3.5&nbsp;billion ofinterests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $49&nbsp;million and $46&nbsp;million ofsenior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities. Seepage 148 of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizationVIEs.Multi-seller conduitsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with Firm-administered,multi-seller conduits, see Note 16 on pages 249&#150;250 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm consolidates its Firm-administeredmulti-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of theconduits and a potentially significant economic interest. The Firm consolidated $20.6&nbsp;billion and$21.7&nbsp;billion of assets held by Firm-administered multi-seller conduits and $20.5&nbsp;billion and $21.6billion of beneficial interests in commercial paper issued to third parties at March&nbsp;31, 2011, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2010, respectively.The Firm provides deal-specific liquidity as well as program-wide liquidity and credit enhancementto the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, which have been eliminated in consolidation. TheFirm-administered multi-seller conduits then provide certain of theirclients with lending-relatedcommitments. The unfunded portion of these commitmentswas $10.3&nbsp;billion and $10.0&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, respectively, and areincluded as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.

The primary purposes of these securitization transactions are to satisfy investordemand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.145 Table of ContentsSecuritization activityThe following tables provide information related to the Firm's securitization activities for thethree months ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase&#151;sponsoredsecuritization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, as sale accounting was achievedbased on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization. For the three monthperiod ended March&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010, there were no mortgage loans that were securitized, exceptfor commercial and other in 2011, and there were no cash flows from the Firm to the SPEs related torecourse or guarantee arrangements.&nbsp;146 Table of ContentsLoans sold to agencies and other third-party sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in thenormal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans, predominantly to GinnieMae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the &#147;Agencies&#148;). These loans are sold primarily for the purpose ofsecuritization by the Agencies, which also provide credit enhancement of the loans through certainguarantee provisions. The Firm does not consolidate these securitization vehicles, as it is not theprimary beneficiary. In connection with these loan sales, the Firm makes certain representationsand warranties. For additional information about the Firm's loan sale- and securitization-relatedindemnifications, see Note 21 on pages 156&#150;159 of this Form 10-Q.For a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with loans sold togovernment-sponsored agencies and other third-party sponsored securitization entities, see Note 16on page 257 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to U.S. government-sponsoredagencies and third-party sponsored securitization entities.&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, loans repurchased, or loans with the option torepurchase, were $13.1&nbsp;billion and $13.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, primarily related to loans sold toU.S. government agencies. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from repurchases of loans soldto U.S. government agencies was $2.3&nbsp;billion and $1.9&nbsp;billion as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December31, 2010, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned continue to beinsured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, and where applicable, reimbursement isproceeding normally.147 Table of ContentsJPMorgan Chase's interest in securitized assets held at fair valueThe following table outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value, as ofMarch&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010, of certain of the Firm's retained interests innonconsolidated VIEs (other than MSRs), that are valued using modeling techniques. The table alsooutlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes inassumptions used to determine fair value. For a discussion of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 149&#150;152of this Form 10-Q.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value basedon a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily, because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivitiesalso do not reflect risk management practices the Firm may undertake to mitigate such risks.148 Table of ContentsLoan delinquencies and net charge-offsThe tablebelow includes information about delinquencies, liquidation losses and components ofoff-balance sheet securitized financial assets as of March&nbsp;31, 2011, and December&nbsp;31, 2010.&nbsp;NOTE 16 &#151; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS For a discussion of accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note17 on pages 260&#150;263 of JPMorgan Chase's 2010 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillThe following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.&nbsp;149
