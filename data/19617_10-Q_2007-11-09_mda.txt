Table of ContentsThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's retained interests other than residential MSRs (for a discussion of residential MSRs, seeNote 17 on page 102 of this Form 10-Q) in its securitizations at September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December31, 2006, respectively; and it outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and20% adverse changes in those assumptions.The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value basedupon a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities.98 Table of ContentsThe table below presents information about delinquencies, net charge-offs (recoveries)&nbsp;andcomponents of reported and securitized financial assets at September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31,2006 (see footnote (c)&nbsp;below).99 Table of ContentsNOTE 16 &#150; VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESRefer to Note 1 on page 94 and Note 15 on pages 118&#150;120 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report fora further description of JPMorgan Chase's policies regarding consolidation of VIEs as well as theutilization of VIEs by the Firm.Multi-seller conduitsThe following table summarizes the Firm's involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.The Firm views its credit exposure to multi-seller conduit transactions as limited. This isbecause, for the most part, the Firm is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if theassets in the VIE are in default. Additionally, the Firm's obligations under the letters of creditare secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the customer or other third parties &#150; forexample, by the overcollateralization of the VIE with the assets sold to it or notes subordinatedto the Firm's liquidity facilities.Client intermediationAssets held by credit-linked and municipal bond vehicles at September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31,2006, were as follows.The Firm may enter into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. Thesetransactions can include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider,investor, underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted atarm's length, and individual credit decisions are based upon the analysis of the specific VIE,taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where these activities do not causeJPMorgan Chase to absorb a majority of the expected losses of the VIEs or to receive a majority ofthe residual returns of the VIE, JPMorgan Chase records and reports these positions similarly toany other third-party transaction. These transactions are not considered significant for disclosurepurposes.100 Table of ContentsConsolidated VIE assetsThe following table summarizes the Firm's total consolidated VIE assets, by classification, on theConsolidated balance sheets, as of September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006.The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs areclassified in the line item titled, &#147;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interestentities&#148; on the Consolidated balance sheets. The holders of these beneficial interests do not haverecourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 19 on page 124 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006Annual Report for the maturity profile of FIN 46R long-term beneficial interests.NOTE 17 &#150; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS For a discussion of accounting policies related to Goodwill and Other intangible assets, see Note16 on pages 121&#150;123 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillGoodwill arises from business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquiredentity over the net fair value amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Theincrease in Goodwill primarily resulted from certain acquisitions by Treasury & Securities Services(&#147;TSS&#148;) and CS, and currency-translation adjustments on the Sears Canada credit cardacquisition. These factors were partially offset by a reduction in Goodwill from theadoption of FIN 48, as well as adjustments for tax-related purchase accounting adjustmentsassociated with the Bank One merger. For a discussion of the impact from adopting FIN 48, see Note20 on page 105 of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill was not impaired at September&nbsp;30, 2007, or December&nbsp;31, 2006, nor was any goodwill writtenoff due to impairment during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006.Goodwill attributed to the business segments was as follows:101 Table of ContentsMortgage servicing rightsFor a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and valuationmethodology of MSRs, see Note 16 on pages 121&#150;122 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. For adiscussion of the valuation of MSRs, see Note 3 on page 76 of this Form 10-Q. The fair value ofMSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds.JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of derivatives and trading instruments to manage changes in thefair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes inthe fair value of the related risk management instruments. MSRs decrease in value when interestrates decline. Conversely, securities (such as mortgage&#150;backed securities), principal-onlycertificates and certain derivatives (when the Firm receives fixed-rate interest payments) increasein value when interest rates decline.The following table summarizes MSR activity, for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007and 2006.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's MSRs at September&nbsp;30, 2007 and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively; and it outlines thesensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.CPR: Constant prepayment rateThe sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value basedupon a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.102 Table of ContentsPurchased credit card relationships and All other intangible assetsFor the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007, Purchased credit card relationships and All otherintangibles decreased by $508&nbsp;million and $412&nbsp;million, respectively, primarily as a result ofamortization expense.Except for $513&nbsp;million of indefinite-lived intangibles related to asset management advisorycontracts which are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, theremainder of the Firm's other acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization.The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were asfollows.Future amortization expenseThe following table presents estimated amortization expenses related to credit card relationships,core deposits and All other intangible assets at September&nbsp;30, 2007.103 Table of ContentsNOTE 18 &#150; EARNINGS PER SHAREFor adiscussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;), see Note 22 onpage 126 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation ofbasic and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006.NOTE 19 &#150; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains andlosses on AFS securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of relatedderivatives), cash flow hedging activities and for 2007, the net actuarial loss and prior servicecost related to the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.104 Table of ContentsNOTE 20 &#150; INCOME TAXESIn July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in incometaxes recognized under SFAS 109. FIN 48 addresses the recognition and measurement of tax positionstaken or expected to be taken, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The Firm adopted and appliedFIN 48 under the transition provisions to all of its income tax positions at the required effectivedate of January&nbsp;1, 2007, resulting in a $436&nbsp;million cumulative effect increase to Retainedearnings, a reduction in Goodwill of $113&nbsp;million and a $549&nbsp;million decrease in the liability forincome taxes.At January&nbsp;1, 2007, JPMorgan Chase's liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding relatedinterest expense and penalties, was $4.7&nbsp;billion of which $1.0&nbsp;billion, if recognized, would reducethe effective tax rate. As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of tax authorities,it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly over the nexttwelve months. JPMorgan Chase does not expect that any such changes would have a material impact onits effective tax rate over the next twelve months.The Firm recognizes interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities in Income taxexpense. Included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities at January&nbsp;1, 2007,in addition to the Firm's liability for unrecognized tax benefits, was $1.3&nbsp;billion for incometax-related interest and penalties, of which the penalty component was not material. Accrued incometax-related interest and penalties increased to $1.6&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2007, due to thecontinuing outstanding status of the unrecognized tax benefit liability, the penalty component ofwhich remains immaterial.JPMorgan Chase is subject to ongoing tax examinations by the tax authorities of the variousjurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. TheFirm's consolidated federal income tax returns are presently under examination by the InternalRevenue Service (IRS)&nbsp;for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. In addition, the consolidated federalincome tax returns of heritage Bank One Corporation, which merged with and into JPMorgan Chase onJuly&nbsp;1, 2004, are under examination for the years 2000 through 2003, and for the period January&nbsp;1,2004, through July&nbsp;1, 2004. Both examinations are expected to conclude in 2008. Certainadministrative appeals are pending with the IRS relating to prior examination periods, for JPMorganChase for the years 2001 and 2002, and for Bank One and its predecessor entities for variousperiods from 1996 through 1999. For years prior to 2001, refund claims relating to income andcredit adjustments, and to tax attribute carrybacks, for JPMorgan Chase and its predecessorentities, including Bank One, either have been or will be filed. Also, interest rate swapvaluations by a Bank One predecessor entity for the years 1990 through 1993 are, and have been, thesubject of litigation in both the Tax Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals.105 Table of ContentsNOTE 21 &#150; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLitigation reserveThe Firm maintains litigation reserves for certain of its outstanding litigation. In accordancewith the provisions of SFAS 5, JPMorgan Chase accrues for a litigation-related liability when it isprobable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonablyestimated. While the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in lightof all information known to it at September&nbsp;30, 2007, the Firm's litigation reserves were adequateat such date. Management reviews litigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may beincreased or decreased in the future to reflect further litigation developments. The Firm believesit has meritorious defenses to claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding litigationand, with respect to such litigation, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigatingor settling cases according to management's judgment as to what is in the best interests ofstockholders.NOTE 22 &#150; ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESThe majority of JPMorgan Chase's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes. Derivatives arealso utilized by the Firm as an end-user to hedge market exposures, to modify the interest ratecharacteristics of related balance sheet instruments or to meet longer-term investment objectives.Both trading and end-user derivatives are recorded in Trading assets and Trading liabilities. For afurther discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments,see Note 28 on pages 131-132 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The following table presentsderivative instrument hedging-related activities for the periods indicated.Over the next 12&nbsp;months, it is expected that $147&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;at September&nbsp;30, 2007, will be recognized inearnings. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, andsuch transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.NOTE 23 &#150; OFF&#150;BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEESFor a discussion of off&#150;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, andthe Firm's related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 132&#150;134 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006Annual Report. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, anallowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on pages93&#150;94 of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion regarding the Allowance for credit losses onlending-related commitments.106 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts of off&#150;balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments and guarantees and the related Allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments at September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006.Off&#150;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guaranteesIncludedin Other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to investment and non-investment grade counterparties inconnection with leveraged acquisitions. These commitments are dependent on whether the acquisitionby the borrower is successful, tend to be short-term in nature and, in most cases, are subject tocertain conditions based on the borrower's financial condition or other factors. Additionally, theFirm often syndicates portions of the initial position to other investors, depending on marketconditions. These commitments generally contain flexible pricing features to adjust for changingmarket conditions prior to closing. Alternatively, the borrower may turn to the capital markets forrequired funding instead of drawing on the commitment provided by the Firm, and the commitment mayexpire unused. As such, these commitments are not necessarily indicative of the Firm's actual riskand the total commitment amount may not reflect actual future cashflow requirements. The amount of these commitments at September 30,2007, was $27.5 billion.For a discussion of the off&#150;balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to beguarantees under FIN 45, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 on pages 132&#150;134 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The amount of the liability related to FIN 45 guaranteesrecorded at September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006, excluding the Allowance for credit losses onlending-related commitments and derivative contracts discussed above,was $324&nbsp;million and $297million, respectively.In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which theFirm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. For a discussionof the derivatives the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, seeNote 29 on pages 132&#150;134 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report. The total notional value of thederivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $88&nbsp;billion and $72&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was a derivativereceivable of $228&nbsp;million and $230&nbsp;million, and a derivative payable of $1.8&nbsp;billion and $987million at September&nbsp;30, 2007, and December&nbsp;31, 2006, respectively.107 Table of ContentsNOTE24 &#150; BUSINESS SEGMENTSJPMorgan Chase is organized into six major reportable business segments: IB, RFS, CS, CommercialBanking (&#147;CB&#148;), TSS and Asset Management (&#147;AM&#148;), as well as a Corporate segment. The segments arebased upon the products and services provided or the type of customer served, and they reflect themanner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. Results of these linesof business are presented on a managed basis. For a definition of managed basis, see the footnotesto the tables below. For a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase's business segments, seeBusiness segment results on page 16 of this Form 10-Q, and pages 34&#150;35 and Note 33 on pages139&#150;141 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report.Business segment financial disclosuresDuring the year, $19.4&nbsp;billion and $6.5&nbsp;billion held-for-investment residential mortgage loans weretransferred to the Corporate segment from RFS and AM, respectively. Although the loans, togetherwith the responsibility for the investment management of the portfolio, were transferred toTreasury, the transfer has no impact on the financial results of RFS, AM or Corporate.Segment resultsThe following tables provide a summary of the Firm's segment results for the three and nine monthsended September&nbsp;30, 2007 and 2006, on a managed basis. The impact of credit card securitizationadjustments have been included in Reconciling items so that the total Firm results are on areported basis. Finally, Total net revenue (Noninterest revenue and Net interest income) for eachof the segments is presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exemptsecurities and investments that receive tax credits are presented in the managed results on a basiscomparable to taxable securities and investments. This approach allows management to assess thecomparability of revenues arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The correspondingincome tax impact related to these items is recorded within Income tax expense (benefit).

Additionalactions, investigations or proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. In view ofthe inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, particularly where theclaimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the cases present novel legaltheories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannotstate with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be, what the timingof the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines, penalties orimpact related to each pending matter may be. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its currentknowledge, after consultation with counsel and after taking into account its current litigationreserves, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pendingagainst it should not have a material, adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition ofthe Firm. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, actions andinvestigations, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will notsignificantly exceed the reserves currently accrued by the Firm; as a result, the outcome of aparticular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period,depending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level ofJPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;1A Risk FactorsFor a discussion of risk factors affecting the Firm, see Part&nbsp;1, Item&nbsp;1A, Risk Factors, on pages4&#150;6 and Forward-Looking Statements on page 147 of JPMorgan Chase's 2006 Annual Report.Item&nbsp;2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of ProceedsDuring the third quarter of 2007, shares of common stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co. were issued intransactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2)thereof, as follows: on July&nbsp;27, 2007, 39,339 shares were issued to retired employees who haddeferred receipt of such common shares pursuant to the Corporate Performance Incentive Plan.The actual amount of shares repurchased under the Firm's repurchase program is subject to variousfactors, including market conditions; legal considerations affecting the amount and timing ofrepurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles);internal capital generation; and alternative potential investment opportunities.
