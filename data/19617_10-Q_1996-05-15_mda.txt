Part IItem 2 (continued)On March 31, 1996, The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("Chase") merged with andinto Chemical Banking Corporation ("Chemical"). Upon consummation of the merger,Chemical changed its name to "The Chase Manhattan Corporation" (the"Corporation"). The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and,accordingly, the information included in this Form 10-Q presents the combinedresults of Chase and Chemical as if the merger had been in effect for allperiods presented. Certain forward-looking statements contained herein aresubject to risks and uncertainties. The Corporation's actual results followingthe merger may differ materially from those set forth in such forward-lookingstatements. Reference is made to the Corporation's reports filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, [in particular the Form 8-K dated April 16,1996] for a discussion of factors that may cause such differences to occur.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Chase Manhattan Corporation (the "Corporation") reported first quarter 1996net income of $937 million, before a merger-related restructuring charge, a 44percent increase from first quarter 1995 results of $650 million. Primaryearnings per share in the first quarter of 1996 were $1.98, before the charge,compared with $1.37 in the same 1995 period. Fully diluted earnings per share inthe first quarter of 1996 were $1.97, before the charge, compared with $1.36 inthe first quarter of 1995. Including the merger-related charge of $1.65 billion($1.026 billion after-tax), the Corporation reported a net loss of $89 millionin the first quarter of 1996.The Corporation's 1996 first quarter results reflected strong revenue growth,coupled with continued success in managing its expenses. The Corporation achieved solid and balanced performances in each of its global banking,regional banking and nationwide consumer businesses, which placed theCorporation in a strong position to achieve the performance targets it hasannounced for 1996.The Corporation's return on average common stockholders' equity excluding therestructuring charge was 19.5% for the first quarter of 1996, compared with14.6% for the 1995 comparable quarter. The Corporation's efficiency ratioimproved to 59.5% for the first quarter of 1996, compared with 67.4% for thefirst quarter of 1995.During the 1996 first quarter, the Corporation recognized a number of specialitems including a charge of $102 million against the Corporation's allowance forcredit losses, as a result of conforming charge-off policies with respect tocredit card receivables; a loss of $60 million ($37 million after-tax) on thesale of a building in Japan; a charge of $40 million ($25 million after-tax)related to conforming its foreign retirement plans; and aggregate tax benefitsand refunds of $132 million.At March 31, 1996, the Corporation's Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratioswere 7.92% and 11.99%, respectively (excluding the assets and off-balance sheetfinancial instruments of the Corporation's securities subsidiaries, as well asthe Corporation's investment in these subsidiaries). These risk-based capitalratios were well in excess of the minimum ratios specified by the Board ofGovernors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve Board") and at March31, 1996, the Corporation was "well capitalized" as defined by the FederalReserve Board.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at March 31, 1996 were $1,686 million,compared with $1,664 million on December 31, 1995, and declined $371 millionfrom $2,057 million at March 31, 1995. Nonperforming assets have declined byapproximately $9.8 billion, or 85%, from their peak level of $11.5 billion in1991. - 17 - Reported net interest income for the first quarter of 1996 was $2,166 million,compared with $2,027 million for the same 1995 period. The 1996 first quarterresults included $54 million of interest related to Federal and State tax auditsettlements. Excluding the impact of the interest related to the aforementionedsettlements, net interest income for the 1996 first quarter increased $85million from 1995 due to a higher level of interest-earning assets (led bygrowth in consumer loans) as well as higher levels of trading-related netinterest income, partially offset by the effect of a higher level of credit cardsecuritizations.The interest rate spread, which is the difference between the average rate oninterest-earning assets and the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities,was 2.58% for the 1996 first quarter, compared with 2.75% for the 1995 firstquarter. The net yield on interest-earning assets, which is the average rate forinterest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds,including the impact of interest-free funds, was 3.43% in 1996, compared with3.48% in 1995. Excluding the impact of credit card securitizations in both yearsand the impact of the interest on the tax settlements in 1996, the net yield inthe 1996 first quarter was 3.52%, compared with 3.54% in the prior year period.The following table reflects the composition of interest-earning assets as apercentage of total earning assets, as well as the interest rate spread and thenet yield on interest-earning assets, for the periods indicated. - 18 - The Corporation's average total loans in the first quarter of 1996 were $149.6billion, compared with $141.2 billion in the comparable 1995 period. Theincrease reflected the continued growth in consumer loans (despite the impact ofa higher level of credit card securitizations) and commercial lending, partiallyoffset by the continued reduction in the commercial real estate portfolio.The growth in interest-earning assets was funded by a $9.0 billion increase ininterest-bearing liabilities. For the 1996 first quarter, averageinterest-bearing liabilities were $214.6 billion, compared with $205.6 billionfor the first quarter of 1995, principally due to a higher level of foreigninterest-bearing deposits and Federal funds purchased and securities sold underrepurchase agreements. The Corporation utilizes repurchase agreements as asource of short-term funding for trading-related positions and for itssecurities portfolio.The negative impact on net interest income from nonperforming loans in the firstquarter of 1996 was $29 million, compared with $31 million in the same quarterin 1995, reflecting the reduction in the level of the Corporation'snonperforming loans.For additional information on average balances and net interest income, seeAverage Consolidated Balance Sheet, Interest and Rates on page 45.Management anticipates that, given its current expectations for interest ratemovements in 1996, the Corporation's net interest income in 1996 will bemodestly higher than in 1995 (prior to the impact of securitizations to beundertaken during 1996).Provision for Losses- --------------------The Corporation's provision for losses was $245 million for the 1996 firstquarter, compared with $186 million in the 1995 fourth quarter, and $185 millionin the 1995 first quarter. The increase in the provision for losses from the1995 first quarter was primarily the result of slightly higher credit card netcharge-offs, as well as higher commercial net charge-offs as a result of a lowerlevel of recoveries.Management anticipates that the provision for losses in 1996 will increase overthe 1995 level due to a lower level of commercial loan recoveries and highercredit card charge-offs. For a discussion of the Corporation's net charge-offs,see the Credit Risk Management Section on pages 30-35. - 19 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Noninterest Revenue- -------------------Noninterest revenue totaled $1,869 million in the 1996 first quarter, anincrease of $312 million, or 20%, when compared with the same period last year.The 1996 first quarter results reflect a $240 million improvement in tradingrevenue, a 15% increase in fees and commissions (principally from corporatefinance and syndication activities, credit card revenue and trust and investmentmanagement fees), and higher securities gains. These increases were partiallyoffset by lower other revenue as the 1996 quarter includes a loss of $60 millionon the sale of a building in Japan while the 1995 quarter included a gain of $85million on the sale of the investment in Far East Bank and Trust Company.The following table presents the components of noninterest revenue for theperiods indicated.Fees and CommissionsCorporate finance and syndication fees were a record $224 million in the 1996first quarter, an increase of 33% from the prior year period. This resulted froma higher level of investment banking activity in both loan syndications and newissues of high-yield securities. During the 1996 first quarter, the Corporationacted as agent or co-agent for approximately $98 billion of syndicated creditfacilities, a reflection of the Corporation's large client base and strongemphasis on distribution.Trust and investment management fees rose $45 million in the 1996 first quarterdue to higher global services activity, reflecting, in part, the acquisition ofthe securities processing businesses of U.S. Trust Corporation ("U.S. Trust") inSeptember 1995 which contributed approximately $24 million of revenue. Theremainder of the increase reflects higher fees resulting from growth in assetsunder management.Credit card revenue increased $51 million to $233 million for the 1996 firstquarter, primarily the result of an increase in securitization volume as well asgrowth in outstandings and active accounts. During the 1996 first quarter, $2.9billion of credit card receivables were securitized. The favorable impact ofthe securitizations on credit card revenue was $75 million in the 1996 firstquarter compared with $26 million in the same 1995 period. Average managedcredit card receivables (credit card receivables on the balance sheet plussecuritized credit card receivables) grew to $23.2 billion for the first quarterof 1996, compared with $19.3 billion for the prior year's comparable period. Fora further discussion of the credit card portfolio and related securitizationactivity, see pages 32-33 of this Form 10-Q. - 20 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table sets forth the components of fees for other financialservices for the periods indicated.Contributing to the rise in other fees for the first quarter of 1996 wereincreased brokerage commissions of $6 million, largely due to higher transactionvolume and a larger customer base at the Corporation's discount brokerage firm,Brown and Company.Trading RevenueThe following table sets forth the components of trading revenue for the firstquarter of 1996 and 1995. - 21 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The $80 million increase in revenue from interest rate contracts during the 1996first quarter was primarily due to anticipated volatility in certain WesternEuropean, Asian and U.S. interest rate markets. Foreign exchange revenue in1996, while down from the first quarter 1995 level, continued to benefit fromvolatility in the currency markets and from the Corporation's market-makingactivities. The increase in debt instrument revenue during the 1996 first quarter, when compared to the same 1995 period, was primarily theresult of the 1995 first quarter results being adversely affected by majordeclines in the prices of emerging markets debt instruments.Trading revenues are affected by many factors, including volatility ofcurrencies and interest rates, the volume of transactions executed by theCorporation on behalf of its customers, the Corporation's success in proprietarypositioning, the credit standing of the Corporation, and the steps taken bycentral banks and governments which affect financial markets. The Corporationexpects its trading revenues will fluctuate as these factors will vary fromperiod to period.Other Noninterest RevenueThe following table presents securities gains (losses) and the composition ofother revenue for the first quarter of 1996 and 1995.The higher level of securities gains, all of which resulted from sales from theavailable-for-sale portfolio, were made in connection with the Corporation'sasset/liability management ("ALM") activities. For a further discussion of theCorporation's securities, see Note 5 - Securities of the Notes to FinancialStatements.The Corporation's other revenue was $259 million for the first quarter of 1996,compared with $414 million for the first quarter of 1995. Revenue fromequity-related investments, which includes income from venture capitalactivities and emerging markets investments, was $223 million in the 1996 firstquarter, an increase of $42 million from the comparable 1995 quarter, benefitingfrom a broad-based portfolio of investments in an active market. Revenue fromequity-related investments has averaged approximately $157 million per quarter,based on revenues during the last eight quarterly periods. At March 31, 1996,the Corporation had equity-related investments with a carrying value ofapproximately $2.8 billion. The Corporation believes that equity-relatedinvestments will continue to make contributions to the Corporation's earnings,although the timing of the recognition of gains from these activities isunpredictable and revenues from such activities could vary significantly fromperiod to period.The first quarter of 1996 included net losses of $35 million related to the disposition of available-for-sale emerging market securities. The comparableperiod in 1995 included a net gain of $24 million on the sale of available-for-sale emerging market securities. - 22 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The $13 million decline in residential mortgage origination/sales activities isentirely attributable to a lower level of gains from the sale of mortgageservicing rights in the 1996 first quarter.All other revenue in the 1996 first quarter included $11 million in net gainsfrom the securitization of automobile financing loans and credit cardreceivables. All other revenue reflected $8 million lower income from theCorporation's investment in CIT, as a result of the sale of half of the Corporation's investment in CIT in December 1995.Noninterest Expense- -------------------Noninterest expense in the 1996 first quarter was $2,437 million (excluding therestructuring charge and other expenses relating to the merger of $1,656million), compared with $2,364 million in the 1995 fourth quarter and $2,335million in the first quarter of 1995. The Corporation recognized a specialcharge of $40 million in the 1996 first quarter to conform retirement benefitsprovided to foreign employees. Excluding the restructuring charge, the specialconformity adjustment for the foreign retirement plans, and foreclosed propertyexpense, noninterest expense increased 2% from the comparable quarter last year,and 1% from the preceding quarter. The increases from the prior quartersprimarily reflect costs related to stronger revenues, including higherincentive costs. Additionally, the first quarter of 1996 includesapproximately $35 million of noninterest expense as a result of the acquisitionof the U.S. Trust processing business in September 1995, and the consolidationof a foreign investment previously recorded on an equity basis, partially offsetby the absence of expenses due to the sale of the southern and centralNew Jersey banking operations in the fourth quarter of 1995. First Quarter ------------------------(in millions) 1996 1995- ------------- ------- ---------Salaries $ 1,076 $ 997Employee Benefits 305 234Occupancy Expense 221 228Equipment Expense 184 198Foreclosed Property Expense (9) (25)Other Expense 660 703 ---------- ---------Total Before Restructuring Charge 2,437 2,335Restructuring Charge and Expenses 1,656 -- ---------- ---------Total $ 4,093 $ 2,335 ========== =========The Corporation's efficiency ratio improved to 59.5% in the 1996 first quarter,compared with 67.4% in the 1995 first quarter. The computation of the efficiencyratio (noninterest expense as a percentage of the total of net interest incomeand noninterest revenue) excludes restructuring charges, foreclosed propertyexpense, and nonrecurring items. During the 1996 first quarter, nonrecurringitems reflected the receipt of interest related to Federal and State tax auditsettlements, a loss on sale of a building in Japan and costs incurred incombining the Corporation's foreign retirement plans. The 1995 first quarterexcluded the gain on the sale of the Corporation's investment in Far East Bankand Trust Company.Salaries and Employee BenefitsThe increase in salaries for the 1996 first quarter was primarily due to higherincentive costs as a result of stronger earnings for most businesses. Alsocontributing to the increase in salaries was the vesting of various stock-basedincentive awards due to the improvement in the Corporation's stock price, thecontinued growth in the Corporation's securities underwriting business and theadditional staff costs resulting from the U.S. Trust acquisition in September1995. Partially offsetting these increases were the impact of personnelreductions undertaken since March 31, 1995 and the aforementioned sale of Chemical New Jersey Holdings. - 23 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the Corporation's full-time equivalent employees atthe dates indicated. March 31, December 31, 1996 1995 --------- ------------Domestic Offices 59,818 60,904Foreign Offices 11,493 11,792 ------- ---------- Total Full-Time Equivalent Employees 71,311 72,696 ======= ==========Employee benefits in the 1996 first quarter increased $71 million from the prioryear's first quarter primarily as a result of the $40 million charge toconform retirement benefits provided to foreign employees, and other expensesassociated with a newly consolidated foreign investment. Also impacting employeebenefits was an increase in FICA expenses associated with the vesting ofstock-based incentive awards.Occupancy and Equipment ExpenseOccupancy expense in the 1996 first quarter decreased by $7 million from theprior year's comparable quarter. The decline from 1995 is largely the result ofthe consolidation of operational and branch facilities and otherexpense-reduction initiatives.The lower level of equipment expense in the 1996 first quarter was primarily theresult of expense reduction initiatives relating to software costs and equipmentrentals.Foreclosed Property ExpenseForeclosed property expense was a credit of $9 million in the 1996 first quartercompared with a credit of $25 million in the first quarter of 1995. The resultsreflected continued progress in reducing the Corporation's real estateportfolio as a result of improved real estate market conditions. The 1995 amountincluded proceeds received from the sale of certain foreclosed propertiespreviously written down.Restructuring ChargeIn connection with the merger, $1.9 billion of one-time merger-related costshave been identified, of which $1.65 billion was taken as a restructuring chargeon March 31, 1996. In addition, $6 million of merger-related expenses wereincurred in the 1996 first quarter and included in the restructuring chargecaption on the income statement. The remaining $244 million of one-timemerger-related costs will be incurred substantially over the next two years asthese costs do not qualify for immediate recognition under a recently issuedaccounting pronouncement. These remaining costs will be reflected in therestructuring charge caption when incurred. The $1.9 billion of merger-relatedcosts reflect severance and other termination-related costs to be incurred inconnection with anticipated staff reductions (approximately $600 million), costsin connection with the planned disposition of certain facilities, premises andequipment (approximately $700 million), and other merger-related expenses,including costs to eliminate redundant back office and other operations andother expenses related directly to the merger (approximately $600 million).Management does not anticipate that the restructuring charge will have amaterial impact on the Corporation's future liquidity. Because of the inherentuncertainties associated with merging two large corporations, there can be noassurance that the $1.9 billion of merger- related costs will reflect the actualcosts ultimately incurred by the Corporation in implementing the merger or thatthe Corporation would not deem it appropriate to take additional charges, as themerger implementation process continues. - 24 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Other ExpenseThe following table presents the components of other expense for the periodsindicated. First Quarter ---------------------------(in millions) 1996 1995- ------------- ------- --------Other Expense: Professional Services $ 129 $ 135 Marketing Expense 90 81 FDIC Assessments 1 57 Telecommunications 85 81 Amortization of Intangibles 43 47 All Other 312 302 ------- -------- Total $ 660 $ 703 ======= ========Other expense for the 1996 first quarter was $660 million, a decrease of $43million, or 6%, from the first quarter of 1995. The improvement reflected a $56million decline in FDIC assessments compared with the first quarter of 1995resulting from the elimination of a FDIC assessment, with the exception ofdeposits associated with the acquisition of former savings and loan branches.Partially offsetting the 1996 first quarter decline were slight increases inother expenses as a result of the aforementioned U.S. Trust acquisition, andconsolidation of a foreign investment.Income Taxes- ------------The Corporation recognized income tax benefits of $214 million in the firstquarter of 1996, compared with income tax expense of $414 million in the firstquarter of 1995. The 1996 amount includes tax benefits related to therestructuring charge, as well as aggregate tax benefits and refunds of $132million. Excluding the tax benefits and refunds of $132 million , the Corporation's effective tax rate was 38.0% in the first quarter of 1996 comparedwith 38.9% in the comparable 1995 quarter.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRO FORMA LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Profitability of the Corporation is tracked with an internal managementinformation system that produces lines-of- business performance for all sectors.The current presentation of lines-of-business results is based on existingmanagement accounting policies at both Chemical and Chase. A uniform set ofmanagement accounting policies is being developed and is expected to beimplemented in the second quarter of 1996. Lines-of-business resultsare subject to restatement as appropriate whenever there are refinements inmanagement reporting policies, changes to the management organization or toreflect future changes in internal management reporting.Guidelines exist for assigning expenses that are not directly incurred by thebusinesses, such as overhead and taxes, as well as for allocating shareholders'equity and the provision for losses, utilizing a risk-based methodology. Alsoincorporated in the guidelines is a process for matching assets and liabilitieswith similar maturity, liquidity and interest characteristics within eachbusiness. Noninterest expenses of the Corporation are fully allocated to thebusiness units except for special corporate one-time charges. Management hasdeveloped a risk-adjusted capital methodology that quantifies different types ofrisk -- credit, market, and operating/business -- within various businesses andassigns capital accordingly. Credit risk is computed using a risk-grading systemthat is consistently applied throughout the Corporation. A long-term expectedtax rate is assigned in evaluating the Corporation's businesses. - 25 - Part IItem 2 (continued) - 26 - Part IItem 2 (continued)GLOBAL BANKThe Global Bank provides banking, financial advisory, trading and investmentservices to corporations and public-sector clients worldwide through a networkof offices in 52 countries, including major operations in all key internationalfinancial centers.

The sector's return onequity in the first quarter of 1996 was 28.1%, compared with 11.7% in 1995 firstquarter. The increase in the first quarter was primarily due to a 13% increasein fee revenue, securities gains, and equity investment gains.The following table sets forth the significant components of Global Bank's totalrevenue by business for the periods indicated.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First Quarter ------------------($ in millions) 1996 1995 ---- ----Total Revenue: Client Management and Investment Banking $ 533 $ 523 Global Markets 587 267 Regional Centers 279 200(a) Equity Investments 213 83 Global Asset Management & Private Banking 199 170(a) Excludes $85 million gain on sale of investment in Far East Bank and Trust Company.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Revenue from Client Management and Investment Banking increased $10 million inthe first quarter of 1996 reflecting a higher level of investment bankingactivity, including loan syndications and new issues of high-yield bonds.Trading-related revenue at Global Markets was higher in the first quarter of1996 when compared with 1995 because the trading results in the first quarter of1995 were adversely affected by major declines in the prices of emerging marketsdebt instruments. Also contributing to the revenue increase was highersecurities gains.Revenue increased $79 million at the Regional Centers in the first quarter of1996 compared with last year's first quarter reflecting higher net interest income due to a 12% increase in loan volume and an increase in trading revenues.Revenue from equity-related investments increased in the first quarter of 1996compared with 1995 resulting from the benefit from a broad-based portfolio ofinvestments in an active market.Revenue at Global Asset Management and Private Banking rose $29 million, in part, since the 1995 first quarter results were adversely affected by the permanent impairment of Barings Bank PLC securities. Also, contributing to thefavorable results was an increase in net interest income resulting from higher loan and deposit volume. - 27 - Part IItem 2 (continued)REGIONAL AND CONSUMER BANKINGRegional and Consumer Banking includes Chase cardmember services (Credit Cards);Deposits and Investments (consumer banking and commercial and professionalbanking); Mortgage Banking; Chase Consumer Credit (home equity secured lending,student lending, and other consumer lending); International Consumer (consumeractivities in Asia and Latin America); Middle Market and Community Development(regional commercial banking); Texas Commerce Equity Holdings Inc. ("TexasCommerce"), the holding company for Texas Commerce Bank National Association;and the Corporation's franchise in northeastern New Jersey, where it has 39branches and private banking operations. The Corporation maintains a leadingmarket share position in serving the financial needs of consumers, middle marketcommercial enterprises and small businesses in the New York metropolitan area.Texas Commerce is a leader in providing financial products and services tobusinesses and individuals throughout Texas and is the primary bank for morelarge corporations and middle market companies than any other bank in Texas.Regional and Consumer Banking's net income of $308 million in the first quarterof 1996 increased $49 million from last year's first quarter results of $259million. The increase in earnings for the first quarter of 1996 were due primarily to lower noninterest expense of $80 million reflectingthe reduced FDIC premium expense and the absence of expenses for Chemical NewJersey Holdings Inc. (which was sold in October 1995). Also contributing wereincreases in noninterest revenue and net interest income of $54 million and $51million, respectively. These favorable results were partially offset by higherloan loss provision of $88 million and an increase in foreclosed propertyexpense of $21 million. The higher credit provision in 1996 reflects thesubstantial growth in credit card outstandings.The following table sets forth the significant components of Regional andConsumer Banking's total revenue by business for the periods indicated.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- First Quarter -------------------------($ in millions) 1996 1995- --------------- ---- ----Total Revenue: Credit Cards $ 669 $ 610 Deposits and Investments 453 470 Mortgage Banking 165 143 Chase Consumer Credit 181 145 International Consumer 60 51 Middle Market and Community Development 243 223 Texas Commerce 309 276- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Credit Cards revenue increased $59 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of1996, compared with last year's first quarter due to a 20% increase in the loanportfolio and a 7% increase in fee revenue reflecting higher late charges.The $17 million decrease at Deposits and Investments in the first quarter of1996 from last year's first quarter is due to a decline in net interest incomereflecting less favorable spreads.Revenue from Mortgage Banking rose $22 million in the first quarter of 1996 fromthe same period in 1995 due to higher net interest income resulting from a 31%increase in loan volume, higher deposit volume and improved loan spreads.Chase Consumer Credit revenues increased $36 million, or 25%, in the firstquarter of 1996 compared with last year's first quarter. This favorable resultis due to higher retail banking fees and an increase in net interest incomereflecting a 9% increase in loan outstandings.The revenue for International Consumer increased $9 million in the first quarterof 1996 from the same period in 1995 due to higher net interest incomereflecting increased loan volumes for international residential mortgages and credit cards and improved loan spreads. - 28 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Middle Market and Community Development revenues increased 9% in the firstquarter of 1996, when compared with last year's first quarter, due to highercorporate finance fees and an increase in net interest income reflecting higherloan volume and improved spreads.Texas Commerce's revenue increased $33 million, or 12%, in the first quarter of1996 when compared with the first quarter of 1995. The improvement in 1996 wasdue to higher net interest income resulting from 14% growth in loan volume aswell as an increase in securities. Also contributing to the increase was an 8%increase in fee revenue and higher securities gains. These favorable resultswere partially offset by higher foreclosed property expense in the 1996 first quarter, when compared with the prior year period, as the 1995 first quarter reflected the recognition of recoveries in the Texas real estate market.GLOBAL SERVICESGlobal Services include custody, cash management, payments, trade services,trust and other fiduciary services. At March 31, 1996, the Corporation wascustodian or trustee for approximately $3.4 trillion of assets. The strategy forGlobal Services is to build world class product capabilities in transaction andinformation services. The earnings for Global Services in the first quarter of1996 increased $15 million when compared with the same period in 1995. The increase is due primarily to higher noninterest revenue and a 16% increase in net interest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense due to theacquisition of the securities processing businesses of U.S. Trust inSeptember 1995. Noninterest revenue rose $44 million, reflecting a 22% increasein fee revenue; due to trust fees as a result of the U.S. Trust acquisitioncoupled with earnings growth in custody services. The increase in net interestincome is due primarily to higher investable balances and the U.S. Trustacquisition.TERMINAL BUSINESSES (LDC AND REAL ESTATE)Terminal Businesses represents discontinued portfolios, which are primarilyrefinancing country debt and the Corporation's commercial real estateproblem asset and nonperforming portfolio, primarily at The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. and Chemical Bank. Terminal businesses had a net loss of $12 million for the first quarter of 1996, compared with $50 million in net income for thefirst quarter of 1995 primarily due to a $35 million net loss related tothe disposition of available-for-sale emerging markets securities in thefirst quarter of 1996 (compared with a net gain of $24 million from sales ofsuch securities in last year's first quarter). Also, net interest income decreased $11 million in the first quarter of 1996 compared with the sameperiod in 1995, due to a decline in loan outstandings. CORPORATECorporate includes the management results attributed to the parent company; theCorporation's investment in CIT; the impact of credit card securitizations; andsome effects remaining at the corporate level after the implementation ofmanagement accounting policies, including residual credit provision and taxexpense. Corporate had a net loss of $992 million including the restructuringcharge of $1.026 billion (after-tax) related to the merger and the following special items: $132 million (after-tax) in tax refunds and benefits; $37 millionloss(after-tax) on the sale of a building in Japan and $25 million loss (after-tax)related to the costs incurred in combining the Corporation's foreign retirement plans. For the first quarter of 1995, Corporate had a netloss of $8 million which included an $11 million after-tax charge due to theadoption of SFAS 106 for foreign employees and a $6 million writedown associated with certain nonperforming residential mortgages. - 29 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------For a discussion of the Corporation's procedures for the management of itscredit risk, reference is made to pages 31-32 of the Corporation's 1995 AnnualReport.LOAN PORTFOLIOThe following loan discussion focuses primarily on developments since December31, 1995 and should be read in conjunction with the Loan Portfolio section onpages 32 through 39 of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.The Corporation's loans outstanding totaled $149.3 billion at March 31, 1996, adecrease of $0.9 billion from year-end 1995, but an increase of $4.3 billionfrom March 31, 1995. The growth in loans outstanding from the 1995 first quarterreflects increases in both the consumer and commercial loan portfolios and thedecrease from the prior quarter reflects $2.9 billion of securitizationscompleted during the 1996 first quarter.The Corporation's nonperforming assets at March 31, 1996 were $1,686 million, anincrease of $22 million from the 1995 year-end level but a decrease of $371million, or 18%, from last year's comparable quarter. The reduction innonperforming assets from March 31, 1995 reflects the improvement in theCorporation's credit profile as a result of a lower level of loans being placedon nonperforming status, repayments, charge-offs, and the Corporation'scontinuing loan workout and collection activities. For a description of theCorporation's accounting policies for its nonperforming loans, renegotiatedloans and assets acquired as loan satisfactions, see Note One of the Notes tothe Consolidated Financial Statements on page 57 of the Corporation's 1995Annual Report.Total net charge-offs were $347 million in the first quarter of 1996, comparedwith $207 million for the comparable period in 1995. The 1996 amount included acharge of $102 million related to conforming the credit card charge-off policiesof Chase and Chemical. For a further discussion of nonperforming assets and netcharge-offs, see the provision for losses section on page 19 and the variouscredit portfolio sections that follow.The following table presents the Corporation's loan and nonperforming assetbalances by portfolio at the dates indicated and the related net charge-offamounts for the periods indicated. Additionally, loans which were past due 90days and over as to principal or interest but not characterized as nonperformingare also included in the table. - 30 - Part IItem 2 (continued) - 31 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Domestic Consumer Portfolio- ---------------------------The domestic consumer loan portfolio consists of one-to-four family residentialmortgages, credit cards, auto and other consumer loans. The domestic consumerloan portfolio totaled $69.1 billion at March 31, 1996, a decrease of $0.3billion from the 1995 year-end but an increase of 7% from March 31, 1995. As apercentage of the total loan portfolio, consumer loans grew to 46% at the end ofthe 1996 first quarter, from 44% at March 31, 1995.Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans at March 31, 1996 were$35.9 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion from the 1995 year-end and anincrease of $6.5 billion from March 31, 1995, primarily reflecting increases inadjustable-rate loan outstandings.Total nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 1996 were $246million, compared with $238 million at December 31, 1995 and $211 million atMarch 31, 1995. At March 31, 1996, nonperforming domestic residential mortgageloans as a percentage of the domestic residential mortgage portfolio was 0.69%,compared with 0.70% at the 1995 year-end and 0.72% at March 31, 1995. Total netcharge-offs of residential mortgage loans were $8 million in the first quarterof 1996, a decrease from $12 million in the comparable 1995 period. Thepercentage of net charge-offs to average residential mortgage loan outstandingsfor the first quarter of 1996 declined to 0.09% from 0.17% for the comparableperiod in the prior year.The Corporation's residential mortgage servicing portfolio amounted to $133.1billion at March 31, 1996, compared with $119.7 billion at March 31, 1995. A discussion of the Corporation's mortgage servicing and loan origination activities is included on page 34 of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.The following table presents the residential mortgage servicing portfolio activity for the first quarters of 1996 and 1995. First Quarter -------------------------(in billions) 1996 1995- ------------- ---- ----Balance at Beginning of Year $ 132.1 $ 118.3 Originations 7.5 2.6 Acquisitions 1.1 3.8 Repayments and Sales (7.6) (5.0) --------- ---------Balance at March 31, $ 133.1 $ 119.7 ========= =========Mortgage servicing rights (included in other assets) amounted to $1,203 millionat March 31, 1996, compared with $1,037 million at March 31, 1995. The increasefrom the prior year's comparable period reflects the corresponding increase inthe Corporation's residential mortgage servicing portfolio and the aforementioned adoption of SFAS 122. For a discussion of derivatives usedin connection with mortgage servicing, see page 15 of this Form 10-Q.Credit Card Loans: The Corporation evaluates its credit card exposure based onits "managed receivables" which include credit card receivables on the balancesheet as well as credit card receivables which have been securitized. During the1996 first quarter, the Corporation securitized $2.9 billion of credit cardreceivables, compared with $1.0 billion in the 1995 first quarter. At March 31,1996, the Corporation had $23.1 billion of managed receivables ($13.7 billion ofreceivables on the balance sheet), compared with $23.7 billion ($17.1 billion onthe balance sheet) at year-end 1995 and $19.6 billion at March 31, 1995 ($16.1billion on the balance sheet). The increase in managed receivables from March31, 1995 reflects the continued strong growth in credit card outstandings,principally due to the co-branded Shell MasterCard and other solicitationprograms. - 32 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table presents the Corporation's average managed credit cardreceivables, the amount of these receivables past due 90 days and over andaccruing, net charge-offs and related ratios for the managed credit cardportfolio for the periods presented.Net charge-offs on managed credit card receivables were $270 million in thefirst quarter of 1996, compared with $189 million in the 1995 first quarterreflecting growth in average managed credit card outstandings and continuinghigher levels of personal bankruptcies. While net charge-offs as a percentageof average managed credit card receivables were 4.66% in the 1996 first quarter,the Corporation has indicated that the ratio for the full year 1996 will approximate 4.5%. Management anticipates continued growth in credit card outstandings and continued higher levels of charge-offs, especially related tohigher personal bankruptcies in 1996. If bankruptcies and delinquencies accelerate at greater than expected levels or if the anticipated growth in outstandings is slower than anticipated, or both, the ratio of net charge-offsas a percentage of average managed credit card outstandings in 1996 could be higher than the anticipated 4.5%.Credit Card Securitizations: For a discussion of the Corporation's credit card securitizations, see page 35 of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.The following table outlines the impact of the securitizations of credit cardreceivables by showing the favorable (unfavorable) change in the reportedConsolidated Statement of Income line items.Favorable (Unfavorable) Impact First Quarter(in millions) 1996 1995- ------------- -------- -------Net Interest Income $ (187) $ (57)Provision for Losses 105 31Credit Card Revenue 75 26Other Revenue 3 7 ------- -------Pre-tax Income Impact of Securitizations $ (4) $ 7 ======= =======Auto and Other Consumer Loans: These consumer loans consist of installment loans(direct and indirect types of consumer finance), automobile financings andstudent loans.Automobile financing loans were $6.2 billion at March 31, 1996, compared with$6.3 billion at December 31, 1995 and $8.4 billion at March 31, 1995. Thedecrease in automobile financing loans was due mainly to the securitization ofapproximately $3.0 billion of these loans during the last nine months of 1995,partially offset by increased demand during the year. Net charge-offs of autoloans were $8 million in the 1996 first quarter, compared with $4 million in thesame period in 1995.Other consumer loans were $13.2 billion at March 31, 1996, an increase of 10%when compared with $12.0 billion at December 31, 1995, and an increase of $2.9billion from March 31, 1995. Net charge-offs of other consumer loans were $29million in the first quarter of 1996, an increase of $2 million from the 1995comparable period. - 33 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Domestic Commercial Portfolio- -----------------------------Domestic Commercial and Industrial Portfolio: The domestic commercial andindustrial portfolio totaled $31.8 billion at March 31, 1996, a decrease from$32.3 billion at December 31, 1995 and $31.9 billion at March 31, 1995. Theportfolio consists primarily of loans made to large corporate and middle marketcustomers and is diversified geographically and by industry. At March 31, 1996,there was no concentration of loans to any industry which exceeded 2% of totalloans.The Corporation is a leading participant in loan originations and sales. Thisactivity is comprised of the sale of loans and lending commitments to investors,generally without recourse. These sales include syndication, assignment andparticipation, and include both short- and medium-term transactions. This loandistribution capability allows the Corporation to compete aggressively andprofitably in wholesale lending markets by enabling it to reduce largerindividual credit exposures and thereby to price more flexibly than if all loanswere held as permanent investments. The Corporation also benefits from increasedliquidity. During the first three months of 1996, the Corporation acted as agentor co-agent for approximately $98 billion in syndicated credit facilities.Nonperforming domestic commercial and industrial loans were $474 million atMarch 31, 1996, compared with $495 million at March 31, 1995. In the firstquarter of 1996, the Corporation had net charge-offs of domestic commercial andindustrial loans of $48 million, compared with net charge-offs of $23 million inthe first quarter of 1995.Management believes that the credit quality of the Corporation's commercial andindustrial loan portfolio will remain relatively stable in 1996, as compared with 1995 (although it expects to have higher net charge-offs in its commercial and industrial loan portfolio in 1996 - rather than net recoveries of $4 millionas it did in 1995 - because of lower gross recoveries).Domestic Commercial Real Estate Portfolio: The domestic commercial real estateportfolio represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loanssecured by one-to-four family residential properties (which are included in theconsumer loan portfolio). The domestic commercial real estate loan portfoliototaled $6.5 billion at March 31, 1996, a decrease from $6.7 billion at December31, 1995 and from $7.8 billion at March 31, 1995. The decreases are principallyattributable to repayments from borrowers.The table below sets forth the major components of the domestic commercial realestate loan portfolio at the dates indicated.Commercial mortgages provide financing for the acquisition or refinancing ofcommercial properties, and typically have terms ranging from two to five years.Construction loans are generally originated to finance the construction of realestate projects. When the real estate project has cash flows sufficient tosupport a commercial mortgage, the loan is transferred from construction statusto commercial mortgage status.The largest concentration of domestic commercial real estate loans is in the NewYork/New Jersey and Texas markets, representing 52% and 24%, respectively, ofthe domestic commercial real estate portfolio. No other state represented morethan 5% of the domestic commercial real estate loan portfolio.Nonperforming domestic commercial real estate loans were $442 million at March31, 1996, an 18% increase from the December 31, 1995 level, but a decrease of$193 million, or 30%, from March 31, 1995. The improvement in nonperformingdomestic commercial real estate asset levels since March 31, 1995 is the resultof increased liquidity in the commercial real estate markets coupled withsuccessful workout activities. The increase from the 1995 year-end resulted fromthe classification of certain retail-related loans as nonperforming. - 34 - Part IItem 2 (continued)Net recoveries of domestic commercial real estate loans in the first quarter of1996 totaled $4 million, compared with $1 million in the same period a year ago.Domestic Financial Institutions Portfolio: The domestic financial institutionsportfolio includes loans to commercial banks and companies whose businessesprimarily involve lending, financing, investing, underwriting, or insurance.Loans to domestic financial institutions were $6.3 billion, or 4% of total loansoutstanding, at March 31, 1996, compared with $5.7 billion at December 31, 1995 and $4.8 billion at March 31, 1995. Loans to domestic financialinstitutions are predominantly secured loans to broker-dealers, domestic commercial banks and domestic branches of foreign banks.FOREIGN PORTFOLIOForeign portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans, loans to financialinstitutions, commercial real estate, loans to governments and officialinstitutions, and consumer loans. At March 31, 1996, the Corporation's totalforeign loans were $35.7 billion, compared with $36.1 billion at December 31,1995, and $36.3 billion at March 31, 1995.Included in foreign loans were foreign commercial and industrial loans of $22.0billion at March 31, 1996, an increase of $1.2 billion from the 1995 year-endand an increase of $2.5 billion from March 31, 1995. Total foreign commercialreal estate loans at March 31, 1996 were $0.8 billion, unchanged from each ofDecember 31, 1995 and March 31, 1995.Foreign nonperforming loans at March 31, 1996 were $336 million, a decrease from$343 million at December 31, 1995 and from $487 million at March 31, 1995. Netrecoveries of foreign loans were $9 million in the first quarter of 1996,compared with net recoveries of $11 million in the 1995 first quarter.ASSETS HELD FOR ACCELERATED DISPOSITIONFor a discussion of the Corporation's Assets Held for Accelerated Dispositionportfolio, reference is made to page 38 of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.The following table presents the reconciliation of Assets Held for AcceleratedDisposition for the periods indicated. Carrying Value First Quarter(in millions) 1996 1995- ------------- ------ -------Balance at January 1, $ 412 $ 526 Additions -- -- Sales (200) (124) ------- -------Balance at March 31, (a) $ 212 $ 402 ======= =======(a) Includes $212 million and $18 million of loans that were performing at March 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. - 35 - Part IItem 2 (continued)DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSIn the normal course of its business, the Corporation utilizes variousderivative and foreign exchange financial instruments to meet the financialneeds of its customers, to generate revenues through its trading activities, andto manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest and currency rates.Derivative and foreign exchange instruments represent contracts withcounterparties where payments are made to or received from the counterpartybased upon specific interest rates, currency levels, other market rates, or on terms predetermined by the contract. These instruments can provide a cost-effective alternative to assuming and mitigating risks associated with traditional on-balance sheet instruments.Derivative and foreign exchange transactions involve, to varying degrees, creditrisk and market risk. The effective management of credit and market risk isvital to the success of the Corporation's trading and asset/liability managementactivities. Because of the changing market environment, the monitoring andmanaging of these risks is a continual process. For a further discussion ofcredit risk, reference is made to pages 38 and 39 of the Corporation's 1995Annual Report.A discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instrumentsutilized in connection with the Corporation's trading activities andasset/liability management activities is provided in Notes 4, 10 and 12 of thisForm 10-Q and pages 40-44 of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.Many of the Corporation's derivative and foreign exchange contracts areshort-term, which mitigates credit risk as transactions settle quickly. Thefollowing table provides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreignexchange contracts outstanding at March 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995.Percentages are based upon remaining contract life of mark-to-market exposureamounts. For the notional amounts and credit exposure outstandings of theCorporation's interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts, see Note10 of this Form 10-Q.The Corporation routinely enters into derivative and foreign exchangetransactions with regulated financial institutions, which the Corporationbelieves have relatively low credit risk. At March 31, 1996, approximately 86%of the mark-to-market exposure of such transactions were with commercial bankand financial institution counterparties, most of which are dealers in theseproducts. Non-financial institutions accounted for only approximately 14% of theCorporation's derivative and foreign exchange mark-to-market exposure.The Corporation does not deal, to any significant extent, in derivatives, whichdealers of derivatives (such as other banks and financial institutions) considerto be "leveraged". As a result, the mark-to-market exposure as well as thenotional amount of such derivatives were insignificant at March 31, 1996. - 36 - Part IItem 2 (continued)ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe allowance for credit losses is available to absorb potential credit lossesfrom the entire loan portfolio, as well as derivative and foreign exchangetransactions. The Corporation deems its allowance for credit losses at March 31,1996 to be adequate. Although the Corporation considers that it has sufficientreserves to absorb losses that may currently exist in the portfolio, but are notyet identifiable, the precise loss content is subject to continuing review basedon quality indicators, industry and geographic concentrations, changes inbusiness conditions, and other external factors such as competition and legaland regulatory requirements. The Corporation will continue to reassess theadequacy of the allowance for credit losses.During the 1996 first quarter, the Corporation incurred a charge of $102 millionagainst its allowance for credit losses as a result of conforming charge-offpolicies with respect to credit card receivables.The Corporation's actual credit losses arising from derivative and foreignexchange transactions were immaterial during the first quarters of 1996 and1995. Additionally, at March 31, 1996 and 1995, nonperforming derivativescontracts were immaterial.The accompanying table reflects the activity in the Corporation's allowance forcredit losses for the first quarters of 1996 and 1995. First Quarter ------------------------(in millions) 1996 1995- ------------- ------ ------- Total Allowance at Beginning of Period $ 3,784 $ 3,894 Provision for Losses 245 185 Charge-Offs (312) (283) Recoveries 67 76 --------- -------- Subtotal Net Charge-Offs (245) (207) Charge Related to Conforming Credit Card Charge-off Policies (102) -- --------- -------- Total Net Charge-offs (347) (207) Other 1 2 --------- -------- Total Allowance at End of Period $ 3,683 $ 3,874 ========= ========The following table presents the Corporation's allowance coverage ratios atMarch 31, 1996, December 31, 1995 and March 31, 1995. - 37 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------TRADING ACTIVITIESMeasuring Market Risk: Market risk is measured and monitored on a daily basisthrough a value-at-risk ("VAR") methodology. VAR is defined as the potentialovernight dollar loss from adverse market movements, with 97.5% confidence basedon historical prices and market rates. The quantification of market risk througha VAR methodology requires a number of key assumptions including confidencelevel for losses, number of days of price history, the holding period, themeasurement of inter-business correlation, and the treatment of risks outsidethe VAR methodology, including event risk and liquidity risk. The approachutilized for these other methodological issues varies among institutions. [Graph Number 1]The preceding chart contains a histogram of the Corporation's daily marketrisk-related revenue. Market risk-related revenue is defined as the daily change in value in marked-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-relatednet interest income or other revenue. Based on actual trading results for the twelve months ended March 31, 1996 which capture the historical correlation among business units, 95% of the variation in the Corporation's daily trading results fell within a $22 million band centered on the daily average amount of$8 million for the quarter. For the twelve months ended March 31, 1996, the Corporation posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 238 out of259 business trading days for international and domestic units. For 237 of the259 days, the Corporation's daily market risk-related revenue or losses occurred within the negative $5 million to positive $15 million range, which is representative of the Corporation's emphasis on market-making and sales activities. For a further discussion of measuring market risk, seepages 40-41 of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTThe objective of the ALM process is to manage and control the sensitivity of theCorporation's income to changes in market interest rates. The Corporation's netinterest income is affected by changes in the level of market interest ratesbased upon differences in timing between the contractual maturity or therepricing (the "repricing") of its assets and liabilities. Interest ratesensitivity arises in the ordinary course of the Corporation's banking businessas the repricing characteristics of its loans do not necessarily match those ofits deposits and other borrowings. This sensitivity can be managed by alteringthe repricing of the Corporation's assets or liabilities, and with the use ofderivative instruments. For a further discussion of the Corporation's ALMprocess, and the derivative instruments used in its ALM activities, see pages 41-44 and Note Eighteen of the Corporation's 1995 Annual Report.Measuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: One tool used by management to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the Corporation is aggregate net gap analysis, an example of which is presented below. Assets and liabilities are placed in gap intervals based on their repricing dates. Assets and liabilities for which no specific repricing dates exist are placed in gap intervals based on management's judgment concerning their most likely repricing behaviors. Derivatives used in interest rate sensitivity management are also included in the applicable gap intervals.A net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilitiesrepricing in that interval from the assets repricing. A negative gap - moreliabilities repricing than assets - will benefit net interest income in adeclining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income ina rising interest rate environment. Conversely, a positive gap - more assetsrepricing than liabilities - will benefit net interest income if rates arerising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment. - 38 - Part IItem 2 (continued)At March 31, 1996, the Corporation had $17,989 million more liabilities thanassets repricing within one year (including net repricing effect of derivative positions), amounting to 6% of total assets. This compares with $21,471 million, or 7%, of total assets at December 31, 1995.At March 31, 1996, based on the Corporation's simulation models, which arecomprehensive simulations of net interest income under a variety of marketinterest rate scenarios, earnings at risk to an immediate 100 basis point risein market interest rates over the next twelve months was estimated to be slightly over 2% of projected 1996 after-tax net income excluding the restructuring charge. At December 31, 1995, the Corporation's earnings at risk to a similar increase in market rates was estimated at approximately 3% of projected after-tax net income excluding the restructuring charge. An immediate 100 basis point rise in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario, used to calibrate risk, and does not necessarily represent management's current view of future market developments.Interest Rate Swaps: Interest rate swaps are one of the various financialinstruments used in the Corporation's ALM activities. Although the Corporationbelieves the results of its ALM activities should be evaluated on an integratedbasis, taking into consideration all on-balance sheet and related derivativeinstruments and not a specific financial instrument, the interest rate swapmaturity table, which follows, provides an indication of the Corporation'sinterest rate swap activity.The following table summarizes the outstanding ALM interest rate swap notionalamounts at March 31, 1996, by twelve-month intervals (i.e., April 1, 1996 toMarch 31, 1997). The decrease in notional amounts from one period to the nextperiod represents maturities of the underlying contracts. The weighted-averageinterest rates to be received and paid on such swaps are presented for eachtwelve-month interval. Variable rates presented are generally based on theshort-term interest rates for relevant currencies, such as the London InterbankOffered Rate (LIBOR). Basis swaps are interest rate swaps based on two floatingrate indices (e.g., LIBOR and prime). The table was prepared under theassumption that variable interest rates remain constant at March 31, 1996 levelsand, accordingly, the actual interest rates to be received or paid will bedifferent to the extent that such variable rates fluctuate from March 31, 1996levels. However, the Corporation expects the impact of any interest rate changesto be largely mitigated by corresponding changes in the interest rates andvalues associated with the linked assets and liabilities. - 39 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The following table summarizes the Corporation's assets and liabilities at March31, 1996 with the notional amount of related derivatives used for ALM purposes. - 40 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The favorable impact on net interest income from the Corporation's ALMderivative activities, whereby derivative instruments are used to alter theyield on certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities, was $11 million for the first quarter of 1996, compared with $54 million for the first quarter of 1995.Approximately $5.6 billion notional amount of derivatives related to mortgageservicing assets and approximately $7.7 billion notional amount of derivativesrelated to mortgage and consumer loans held for sale were outstanding at March31, 1996. The weighted average maturity of contracts linked to mortgageservicing assets is approximately four years. Contracts related to loans heldfor sale generally mature within one year.The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses and unrecognizedgains/losses of the Corporation's ALM derivative contracts for March 31, 1996and December 31, 1995.The net deferred losses at March 31, 1996 are expected to be amortized as yieldadjustments in interest income or interest expense, as applicable, over the periods reflected in the following table.Amortization of Net Deferred Gains (Losses) on Closed ALM Contracts(in millions) - ------------- 1996 $ 91997 (35)1998 (73)1999 (58)2000 (60)2001 and After 43 -------------- Total $ (174) ==============The Consolidated Balance Sheet includes unamortized premiums on open ALM optioncontracts which will be amortized as a reduction to net interest income over theperiods indicated in the following table.Amortization of Premiums on Open ALM Option Contracts(in millions) - ------------- 1996 $ 231997 221998 211999 182000 162001 and After 46 -------------- Total $ 146 ============== - 41 - Part IItem 2 (continued)- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Corporation, like all large financial institutions, is exposed to many typesof operating risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders,unauthorized transactions by employees, and errors relating to computer andtelecommunications systems. The Corporation maintains a system of controls thatis designed to keep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of thefinancial strength of the Corporation, the characteristics of the businesses andmarkets in which the Corporation operates, competitive circumstances andregulatory considerations. However, from time to time in the past, theCorporation has suffered losses from operating risk and there can be noassurance that the Corporation will not suffer such losses in the future.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following capital and liquidity discussion focuses primarily on developmentssince December 31, 1995. Accordingly, it should be read in conjunction with theCapital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 45-47 of theCorporation's 1995 Annual Report.CAPITALThe Corporation's level of capital at March 31, 1996 remained strong, withcapital ratios well in excess of regulatory guidelines. The Corporation's Tier 1and Total Capital ratios were 7.92% and 11.99%, respectively. These ratios, aswell as the leverage ratio, exclude the assets and off-balance sheet financialinstruments of the Corporation's securities subsidiaries as well as theCorporation's investment in such subsidiaries. In addition, the provisions ofSFAS 115 do not apply to the calculation of these ratios.Total capitalization (the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital) decreased by$726 million during the first quarter of 1996 to $27.6 billion at March 31, 1996primarily due to the impact of the restructuring charge. The Corporation manages its capital to execute its strategic business plans and supportits growth and investments, including acquisition strategies in its core businesses.During the first quarter of 1996, the Corporation repurchased approximately 11.0million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market. Theserepurchases were largely undertaken to meet the needs of theCorporation's employee stock option and incentive plans. During the 1996 firstquarter, approximately 10.4 million shares were issued (all of which were fromtreasury) under various employee stock option and incentive plans. The buy-backprogram under which these repurchases were made has been revised to terminate atSeptember 30, 1996. For a further discussion see Note 3 of this Form 10-Q.The Corporation raised the cash dividend on its common stock to $.56 per share,an increase from $.50 per share, commencing with the dividend payable on April30, 1996. Management's current expectation is that the dividend policy of theCorporation will generally be to pay a common stock dividend equal toapproximately 25- 35% of the Corporation's net income (excluding restructuringcharges) less preferred dividends. Future dividend policies will be determinedby the Board of Directors in light of the earnings and financial condition ofthe Corporation and its subsidiaries and other factors, including applicablegovernmental regulations and policies.Total stockholders' equity at March 31, 1996 was $19.8 billion, compared with$20.8 billion at December 31, 1995. The $1.0 billion decrease from the 1995year-end primarily reflects the after-tax impact of the restructuring charge onnet income ($1,026 million), a $373 million unfavorable impact on the fair valueof available-for-sale securities accounted for under SFAS 115 and the effects ofcommon and preferred stock dividends totaling $382 million. These declines werepartially offset by $937 million of net income generated during the quarterbefore the restructuring charge. The market valuation of the available-for-salesecurities does not include the impact of related funding sources. - 42 - Part IItem 2 (continued)The tables which follow set forth various capital ratios and components ofcapital at the dates indicated.As part of the Corporation's commitment to a disciplined capital policy,management has targeted a Tier 1 capital ratio for the Corporation of 8 to8.25%. In addition, as stated above, the Corporation has revised itspreviously announced buy-back program to terminate at September 30, 1996 and toprovide that purchases of shares of common stock of the Corporation under theplan to such date would be in accordance with the pooling-of-interestsaccounting rules. - 43 - Part IItem 2 (continued)LIQUIDITYThe primary source of liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the Corporationderives from their ability to generate core deposits (which includes alldeposits except noninterest-bearing time deposits, foreign deposits andcertificates of deposit of $100,000 or more). The Corporation considers fundsfrom such sources to comprise its subsidiary banks' "core" deposit base becauseof the historical stability of such sources of funds. These deposits fund aportion of the Corporation's asset base, thereby reducing the Corporation'sreliance on other, more volatile, sources of funds. The average core deposits atthe Corporation's bank subsidiaries for the first three months of 1996 were $79billion, and represented 53% of average loans for the period. Foreign depositsgenerated in the Corporation's global wholesale and retail businesses are alsoconsidered to be an additional source of liquidity for the Corporation.The Corporation is an active participant in the capital markets. In addition toissuing commercial paper and medium-term notes, the Corporation raises fundsthrough the issuance of long-term debt, common stock and preferred stock. TheCorporation's long-term debt at March 31, 1996 was $12,977 million, an increaseof $152 million from the 1995 year-end. The increase resulted from additions tothe Corporation's long-term debt of $725 million (including $250 million ofsenior medium-term notes, $75 million of subordinated medium-term notes, $200million of other senior notes and $200 million of other subordinated notes).These increases were partially offset by maturities of $566 million of theCorporation's long-term debt (including $201 million of senior medium-termnotes, $115 million of other senior notes and $250 million of other subordinatednotes) and the redemption of $5 million of medium-term notes. The Corporationwill continue to evaluate the opportunity for future redemptions of itsoutstanding debt in light of current market conditions.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following supervision and regulation discussion focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1995. Accordingly, it should be read inconjunction with Supervision and Regulation of The Chase Manhattan Corporation,filed as Exhibit 99.3 of the Corporation's Form 8-K dated April 16, 1996.DIVIDENDSAt March 31, 1996, in accordance with the dividend restrictions applicable tothem, the Corporation's bank subsidiaries could, during 1996, without theapproval of their relevant banking regulators, pay dividends in the aggregate ofapproximately $2.1 billion to their respective bank holding companies, plus anadditional amount equal to their net income from April 1, 1996 through the datein 1996 of any such dividend payment.In addition to the dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations,the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and theFDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibitor to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations theysupervise, including the Corporation and its subsidiaries that are banks or bankholding companies, if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividendwould constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financialcondition of the banking organization.FDICIAThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")required the FDIC to establish a risk-based assessment system for FDIC depositinsurance. FDICIA also contained provisions limiting certain activities andbusiness methods of depository institutions. Finally, FDICIA provided forexpanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, includingparent holding companies, by such institutions' appropriate Federal bankingregulator. Each of the Corporation's banking institutions were "wellcapitalized" as that term is defined under the various regulations promulgatedunder FDICIA and, therefore, the Corporation does not expect such regulations tohave a material adverse impact on their business operations.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONFor a discussion of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), see page 47 of theCorporation's 1995 Annual Report.
