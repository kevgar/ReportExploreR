Table of ContentsPart 1Item&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEWbp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningfulFinancial Highlights &#151; Reported Basis: Reported net income for J.P. MorganChase & Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;)was $1.4&nbsp;billion, or $0.69 per share, in the first quarter of 2003, compared with anet loss of $387&nbsp;million, or ($0.20) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2002,and net income of $982&nbsp;million, or $0.48 per share, in the first quarter of 2002.Total revenue of $8.4&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2003 was up 12% comparedwith the 2002 fourth quarter and up 11% versus the year-ago quarter. Theincreases were driven by record revenues at Chase Financial Services,particularly at Chase Home Finance, and higher revenues at the Investment Bank,reflecting strong fixed income results and an improved performance in equities.Results were negatively affected by continued losses at JPMP and lower revenuesat Investment Management & Private Banking.Total Noninterest Expense of $5.5&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2003 declined23% from the 2002 fourth quarter and increased 3% over the first quarter of2002. The fourth quarter of last year included a $400&nbsp;million charge related tothe Enron surety litigation settlement, the establishment of a litigationreserve of $900&nbsp;million and $393&nbsp;million in merger and restructuring costs;there were no such special items in the first quarter of 2003. The 3% increasefrom first quarter last year was primarily driven by higher compensationexpenses, resulting from higher earnings-related incentive accruals,increased costs related to stock-based compensation and pensionexpenses, andhigher occupancy-related costs.Provision for Credit Losses for the 2003 first quarter of $743&nbsp;million was down19% from the 2002 fourth quarter and relatively flat when compared with the2002 first quarter, reflecting lower commercial net charge-offs.The first quarter provision included a $73&nbsp;million addition to the allowancefor lending-related commitments.Summary of Segment Results: In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on areported basis, management utilizes &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of itsbusiness segments. In the first quarter of 2003, reported results and resultson an operating basis were the same, as there were no merger and restructuringcosts or special items in 2003. On an operating basis, earnings were $1.2billion, or $0.57 per share, in the first quarter of 2002 and $730&nbsp;million, or$0.36 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2002. For additional information anda reconciliation between the Firm's reported and operating results, see page30.22 Table of ContentsPart 1Item&nbsp;2&nbsp;(continued)Total assets as of March&nbsp;31, 2003, were $755&nbsp;billion, compared with $759billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, and $713&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2002. JPMorganChase's Tier 1 Capital ratio was 8.4% at March&nbsp;31, 2003, compared with 8.2% atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, and 8.6% at March&nbsp;31, 2002.Outlook: The Firm's business outlook for the remainder of the year remainscautious. Client activity in mergers and acquisitions and equity underwritingremains low, adversely affecting investment banking fees and delayingopportunities to realize gains in private equity. Commercial credit quality, asreflected in the level of nonperforming assets and exposures deemed&#147;criticized,&#148; has shown meaningful improvement from year-end, but commercialcredit costs remain at high cyclical levels. Results at Chase FinancialServices are likely to be lower than in the first quarter of 2003, primarily atChase Home Finance, which had exceptionally high earnings. These are expectedto moderate, as mortgage origination volumes and interest rate spreads are notexpected to remain at first quarter 2003 levels.23 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results of operations on a reported basis.NM &#150; Not meaningfulInvestment Banking FeesInvestment banking fees of $616&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 declined$62&nbsp;million, or 9%, from the fourth quarter of 2002, and$139&nbsp;million, or 18%, from the first quarter of 2002. The decline in feesreflected continuing low levels of activity in mergers and acquisitions(&#147;M&A&#148;), equity underwriting and loan syndication markets. Advisory fees of$166&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 were $67&nbsp;million lower than thefourth quarter of 2002, and were down 13% from the comparable period of 2002.Underwriting revenues and other fees of $450&nbsp;million were comparable to thefourth quarter of 2002, but down 20% relative to the same period a year ago.Despite the declines in investment banking fees, the Investment Bank achieved,for the first time, top three league table status concurrently in GlobalAnnounced M&A, Global Loan Syndications, and Global Equity andEquity-Related andU.S. Investment-Grade Bond underwriting. See the Investment Bank segment discussionon pages 32-33 for details.Trading RevenueTrading revenue of $1.2&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2003 represented thehighest trading results since the first quarter of 2002. The significantincrease from the fourth quarter of 2002 reflected strong fixed income results,driven by strong client demand for debt securities and derivatives. The resultswere also favorably affected by strong portfolio management and proprietaryrisk-taking revenues. Equity trading also rebounded significantly from thefourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to the strong performance in equityderivatives. Trading revenue, on a reported basis, excludes the impact of NetInterest Income related to the Investment Bank's trading activities; thisincome is recorded within Net Interest Income. However, the Firm includes theserevenues for segment reporting in assessing the profitability of the InvestmentBank's trading business. For additional information on trading revenue, see theInvestment Bank segment discussion on pages 32-33.NM &#150; Not meaningful24 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Fees and CommissionsFees and commissions of $2.6&nbsp;billion for the first quarter of 2003 increased14% from the fourth quarter of 2002 but remained relatively stable incomparison with the first quarter of 2002. The table below provides thesignificant components of fees and commissions:NM &#150; Not meaningfulInvestment Management, Custody and Processing ServicesFees from investment management, custody and processing services were up 3%from the fourth quarter of 2002 but down 11% from the first quarter of 2002.The investment management fee component of this category increased slightlyfrom the prior quarter but decreased 11% from the first quarter of 2002. Thedecrease from the prior year's first quarter was attributable to the lowervalue of equity-related assets under management and institutional outflows.Custody and processing services fees were slightly higher than the fourthquarter of 2002 as a result of an increase in securities lending andbroker-dealer activities. In comparison with the first quarter of 2002, thisyear's first quarter was down 11%, driven by the depressed values of securitiesin safekeeping, continuing slowdown in cross-border investment flows and lowersecurities lending volume. For additional information on investment management,see Investment Management & Private Banking, and for custody and processingservices, see Treasury & Securities Services segment discussions on pages 35-36and 34, respectively.Credit Card RevenueCredit card revenue decreased 14% from the record level of $807&nbsp;million in thefourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to seasonal factors. The increase of 18%over the 2002 first quarter was attributable to higher revenues associated withthe $10.1&nbsp;billion growth in the average securitized portfolio, which was partly theresult of the acquisition of the Providian Master Trust portfolio in February2002.Brokerage and Investment ServicesIn the 2003 first quarter, brokerage and investment services were comparablewith fourth quarter 2002 levels but declined 9% from the 2002 first quarter.The decline from the year-ago period was attributable to lower equity brokeragefees in the Investment Bank as a result of narrower spreads.Mortgage Servicing FeesMortgage servicing fees of $90&nbsp;million increased considerably from both thefourth and first quarters of 2002, as the favorable interest rate environmentproduced record volumes of mortgage originations, which resulted in anincreased balance of loans serviced. The Firm believes that production volumeis likely to moderate in subsequent quarters in 2003. During the first quarterof 2003, gains on the derivatives used to hedge the value of the MSRssignificantly offset any impairment of the assets. This was primarilyattributable to the steepening of the yield curve. For a further discussion ofthese fees, see Chase Home Finance discussion on page 39.Other Lending-Related Service FeesIn the first quarter of 2003, other lending-related service fees declined 23%and 5% from the fourth and first quarters of 2002, respectively. The decreasefrom the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to lower standbyletter-of-credit fees. The decline from the first quarter of last year was dueto lower loan commitment and other lending-related service fees reflecting theslowdown in the economy.25 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Deposit Service FeesDeposit service fees in the first quarter of 2003 increased 3% from the fourthquarter of 2002 but decreased slightly from the first quarter of 2002. Theincrease from the prior quarter resulted from the lower interest rateenvironment, which reduced the value of customers' compensating depositbalances; consequently, customers paid incremental fees for deposit services.This was partly offset by lower balance-deficiency fees, as many customers atChase Regional Banking increased their account balances by transferring cashfrom brokerage to bank deposit accounts, in response to the uncertain marketenvironment.Other FeesOther fees of $245&nbsp;million rose 6% and 5%, respectively, from the fourth andfirst quarters of 2002. The increases reflected a payment received for theearly termination of a marketing contract, as well as higher securitiesprocessing-related fees. The increase from the first quarter of 2002 was partlyoffset by lower insurance commissions on variable annuity sales. ChaseFinancial Services began underwriting a portion of the annuities that were soldin the second quarter of 2002, resulting in certain insurance-related revenuebeing reported as Net Interest Income.Private Equity Gains (Losses)Private equity losses were $221&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003, comparedwith losses of $68&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $238&nbsp;million inthe first quarter of 2002. For a discussion of private equity gains (losses),see the JPMP segment results on pages 36-37.Securities GainsIn the first quarter of 2003, securities gains were $485&nbsp;million, $262&nbsp;millionlower than the fourth quarter of 2002, reflecting lower gains on the securitiessold at Chase Home Finance. Compared with the first quarter of 2002, securitiesgains were up substantially, driven by the higher volume of securities sold inconnection with the asset/liability management activities of theFirm. The 2003 first quarter results included $96&nbsp;million of gains realized from thesales activities within Chase Home Finance's investment securities portfolio. This compared withgains of$388&nbsp;million and losses of $13&nbsp;million in the 2002 fourth and first quarters,respectively. Available-for-sale securities are used by Chase Home Finance tohedge the economic value of MSRs.Other RevenueResidential mortgage origination and sales activities of $378&nbsp;million in thefirst quarter of 2003 were significantly higher than the fourth and firstquarters of 2002. The increases were attributable to the significant growth inloan applications and originations, which were a record high for Chase HomeFinance. For additional information on mortgage-related revenue, see the ChaseFinancial Services segment discussion on pages 38-40, and Notes 8 and 9.All other revenue of $103&nbsp;million increased significantly from the 2002 fourthquarter and was almost twice the amount of the first quarter of 2002. The firstquarter of 2003 reflected a gain of $27&nbsp;million on the sale of a nonstrategicasset management business, partly offset by lower equity income from AmericanCentury Companies, Inc. (&#147;American Century&#148;), which incurred certainnonoperating charges during the quarter. The Firm has a 45% interest inAmerican Century. The 2002 first quarter also included write-downs of certainLatin American investments totaling $57&nbsp;million.Net Interest IncomeNet Interest Income of $3.2&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2003 increased 8%from the fourth quarter of 2002 and 10% from the same period a year ago. Theprimary driver for the increases was the reduction in interest rates, whichcontributed to growth in consumer loans and wider spreads, particularly inmortgages and automobile loans. Partially offsetting the effect of theincreases in consumer loan volumes were lower commercial loans, reflecting theFirm's strategic initiative to reduce its credit risk profile, and thenarrowing of spreads at Chase Regional Banking despite higher average depositbalances.Net Interest Income included $683&nbsp;million of trading-related Net InterestIncome in the first quarter of this year. This level was comparable to thefourth quarter of 2002, but 62% higher than the first quarter of 2002. Theincrease from last year's first quarter was primarily attributable to higherinterest rate spreads on trading-related assets.26 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)On an aggregate basis, the Firm's total average interest-earning assets for thefirst quarter of 2003 were $598.2&nbsp;billion, compared with$583.3&nbsp;billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The net interest yield onthese assets, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 2.19% in the 2003 firstquarter, 15 basis points higher than the last quarter of 2002.NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal Noninterest Expense for the quarter was $5.5&nbsp;billion, down 23% from thefourth quarter of 2002, but up 3% from the first quarter of 2002. The fourthquarter of 2002 included charges related to the Enron surety litigationsettlement, the establishment of a litigation reserve, merger and restructuringcosts and higher severance and related costs. Compared with the first quarterof 2002, compensation costs were higher due to higher incentive accruals andincreased stock-based compensation and pension costs. Occupancy-related costsalso were higher compared to the first quarter of 2002.Total severance and other related costs for the Firm were $171&nbsp;million in thefirst quarter of 2003, $500&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $106million in the first quarter of last year. Severance and other related costsincluded the costs of exiting vacant premises worldwide. These exit costs,which are recorded in Occupancy Expense, amounted to $78&nbsp;million in the firstquarter of this year; there were no such costs in the fourth and first quartersof 2002.The following table presents the components of Noninterest Expense:NM &#150; Not meaningfulCompensation ExpenseCompensation expense in the first quarter of 2003 was $3.2&nbsp;billion, up 5% fromthe fourth quarter of 2002 and 12% from the first quarter of 2002. The increasefrom the immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to higher incentives,reflecting the growth in earnings, primarily in the Investment Bank. Also,included in compensation expense for the 2003 first quarter was $65&nbsp;millionrelated to the adoption of SFAS 123, as well as higher pension and otherpostretirement benefit costs. The higher pension and other postretirementbenefit costs were primarily due to changes in actuarialassumptions related to the expected returns on plan assets and theamortization of unrecognized losses on plan assets. These items were partiallyoffset by lower severance-related costs of $76&nbsp;million recognized in the firstquarter of 2003, compared with $441&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter and $106million in the first quarter of 2002. The increase in Compensation expense fromthe first quarter of 2002 was similarly attributable to higher incentives,higher stock-based compensation (reflecting the reversal in 2002 of $32&nbsp;millionof previously accrued expenses related to certain forfeitable key employeestock awards granted in 1999) and pension and other postretirement benefitcosts, partially offset by lower severance costs.Occupancy ExpenseOccupancy expense of $496&nbsp;million in the 2003 first quarter increased $71million from the fourth quarter of 2002 and $158&nbsp;million from the first quarterof 2002. The increases from both periods were primarily due to a charge in 2003of $78&nbsp;million to cover the costs of exiting excess vacant premises worldwide,in response to lower staff levels. Also contributing to the increase from thefirst quarter of 2002 were the effects of additional leased space in midtownManhattan, higher real estate taxes in New York and the costs of enhancedsafety measures. JPMorgan Chase will continue to evaluate its current andprojected space requirements. There is no assurance that the Firm willbe able to dispose of its excess premises, nor is there any assurancethat it will not incur additional charges in connection with suchdispositions, if any.27 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Technology and Communications ExpenseIn the first quarter of 2003, technology and communications expense remainedrelatively flat in comparison with the fourth quarter of 2002 but was $28million lower than the first quarter of 2002, primarily the result ofexpense-management initiatives. These initiatives reduced software andtelecommunications expenses, as well as the costs of supporting the technologyinfrastructure of the Firm.Amortization of IntangiblesAmortization of intangibles in the 2003 first quarter decreased $8&nbsp;million fromthe fourth quarter of 2002 but increased $5&nbsp;million from the first quarter of2002. The decrease from the fourth quarter reflected the recognition ofamortization expense, in a pattern consistent with the economic benefit derivedfrom acquired portfolios. The increase from the first quarter of 2002 wasattributable to the full-quarter impact of Providian, which was acquired inFebruary 2002. For a further discussion of the amortization of intangibles andthe expected level of expense for the remainder of the year, see Note 12.Other ExpenseIn the first quarter of 2003, other expense was lower than in both the 2002fourth and first quarters. The following table presents the components of otherexpense:Management currently anticipates that Noninterest Expense for full-year 2003 will be slightly higher than thosefor full-year 2002 (excluding from 2002 expenses the impact of thelitigation and merger charges). However, incentive expense will depend onrevenues and earnings over the remainder of 2003.Merger and Restructuring CostsCommencing January&nbsp;1, 2003, all expenses related to the restructuring ofbusinesses were recorded in their related expense categories. In contrast, lastyear's merger and restructuring charges of $393&nbsp;million in the fourth quarterand $255&nbsp;million in the first quarter were viewed by management as nonoperatingexpenses or &#147;special items.&#148; Refer to the discussion of compensation andoccupancy expenses above for a description of restructuring costs incurred inthe first quarter of 2003 and page 21 and Note 6 on page 78 of JPMorganChase's 2002 Annual Report.28 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Provision for Credit LossesThe 2003 first quarter Provision for Credit Losses of $743&nbsp;million decreased by$178&nbsp;million from the 2002 fourth quarter and by $10&nbsp;million from the 2002first quarter. The decline from the prior quarter primarily reflected lowercommercial charge-offs. See pages 44-54 for a discussion of charge-offsassociated with the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and pages53-54 for adiscussion of the Allowance for Credit Losses.Income Tax ExpenseIn the first quarter of 2003, JPMorgan Chase recognized income tax expense of$722&nbsp;million, compared with a benefit of $200&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of2002 and an expense of $505&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002. The effectivetax rates were 34% for all periods.RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING BASISThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using U.S. GAAP. TheConsolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP appearon pages 3&#150;6. That presentation, which is referred to as &#147;reported basis,&#148;provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can beconsistently tracked from year to year and enables a comparison of the Firm'sperformance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financial statements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementlooks at results on an &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of its businesses andto measure overall Firm results against targeted goals. The definition ofoperating basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and then excludesthe impact of credit card securitizations. JPMorgan Chase periodicallysecuritizes a portion of its credit card portfolio by selling a pool of creditcard receivables to a trust, which issues securities to investors. When creditcard receivables are securitized, the Firm ceases to accrue the relatedinterest and credit costs; instead, the Firm receives fee revenue forcontinuing to service those receivables and additional revenue from anyinterest and fees on the receivables in excess of the interest paid toinvestors, net of credit losses and servicing fees. As a result, securitizationdoes not change JPMorgan Chase's reported or operating net income; however, itdoes affect the classification of items in the Consolidated Statement ofIncome.The Firm also reports credit costs on a &#147;managed&#148; or &#147;operating&#148; basis. Creditcosts on an operating basis are composed of the Provision for Credit Losses inthe Consolidated Statement of Income (which includes a provision for creditcard receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as well as the credit costsassociated with securitized credit card loans. As the holder of the residualinterest in the securitization trust, the Firm bears its share of the creditcosts for securitized loans. In the Firm's U.S. GAAP Consolidated FinancialStatements, credit costs associated with securitized credit card loans reducethe noninterest income remitted to the Firm from the trust. This income isreported in credit card revenue in Fees and Commissions over the life of thesecuritization.Prior to 2003, the Firm also excluded from its operating results the impact ofmerger and restructuring costs and special items, as these transactions wereviewed by management as not part of the Firm's normal daily business operationsor unusual in nature and, therefore, not indicative of trends. (To beconsidered a special item, the nonrecurring gain or loss had to be at least $75million.) Commencing in 2003, management has determined that many of the costspreviously considered nonoperating will be deemed operating costs; therefore,all such costs will be included in the Firm's reported results. However, it ispossible that in the future, management may designate certain material gains orlosses incurred by the Firm to be &#147;special items.&#148;In allocating the allowance (and provision) for credit losses, each business isresponsible for its credit costs, including actual net charge-offs and changesin the specific and expected components of the allowance. The residualcomponent of the allowance, available for losses in any business segment, ismaintained at the corporate level. Management views the residual component asnecessary to address uncertainties in the portfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2003,primarily in the commercial portfolio.29 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following summary table provides a reconciliation between the Firm'sreported and operating results:The following table provides a reconciliation of earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;)based on the Firm's reported net income to EPS calculated on an operatingbasis:30 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)SEGMENT RESULTSJPMorgan Chase's segment results reflect the manner in which financialinformation is currently evaluated by the Firm's management and is presented onan &#147;operating&#148; basis. Prior-period segment results have been adjusted toreflect alignment of management accounting policies or changes inorganizational structure among businesses. Restatements of segment results mayoccur in the future. For a discussion of the Firm's methodology of allocatingcapital to its business units, see page 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 AnnualReport.The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basisfor the five major business segments.Summary of Segment ResultsNM &#150; Not meaningful31 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the Investment Bank (&#147;IB&#148;), seepages 26&#150;28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report. The following table setsforth selected IB financial data:bp &#150; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#150; Not meaningfulBUSINESS REVENUE:IB reported operating earnings of $932&nbsp;million in the first quarter, comparedwith $361&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $764&nbsp;million in the firstquarter of 2002. Operating earnings for the quarter were driven by strongcapital markets revenues, expense discipline and lower credit costs. Return onEconomic Capital of 20% rose from 8% in the fourth quarter of 2002 and from16% in the first quarter of 2002, respectively.Operating revenues of $4.0&nbsp;billion in the first quarter were 21% higher than inthe fourth quarter of 2002 and up 11% from the first quarter of 2002.32 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Investment Banking fees of $621&nbsp;million decreased 4% from the fourth quarter of2002 and were down 16% from the first quarter of 2002. The decrease reflectedindustry-wide weakness in M&A activity, equity underwriting and loansyndication markets. Advisory revenues were down 26% and 18% from the fourthquarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2002, respectively. Underwriting andother fees were up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2002 but down 15% from thefirst quarter of 2002, the result of weakness in equity underwriting and loansyndication activity. For the first quarter of 2003 the Firm ranked #1 for thefirst time ever in U.S. Equities and Equity-Related transactions. It alsoranked #3 in Global Equity and Equity-Related and #3 in Global Announced M&Aand maintained leadership positions in U.S. investment-grade bonds and GlobalLoan Syndications. 1The IB evaluates its capital markets activities, including sales and trading,treasury and corporate lending activities, by considering all revenues relatedto these activities. These revenues include trading, fees and commissions,securities gains and related Net Interest Income and other revenues. Inaddition, these activities are managed on a total-return revenue basis. Thisincludes operating revenues plus the unrealized gains or losses on third-partyor internally transfer-priced assets and liabilities, primarily in fixed incomeand treasury activities, which are not accounted for on a mark-to-market basisthrough earnings.Capital Markets total-return revenue was $3.3&nbsp;billion, up 33% and 13% from thefourth quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2002, respectively. Fixedincome total-return revenue of $1.9&nbsp;billion increased 31% from the fourthquarter of 2002 and 14% from the first quarter of 2002, primarily driven bystrength in credit markets trading and improvement in interest rate trading.Global Treasury, which manages the Firm's interest rate exposure and investmentsecurities activity, achieved record results, driven by higher spreads on fixedincome positions and tighter mortgage-backed securities spreads. GlobalTreasury's total-return revenue of $536&nbsp;million was up 15% from the fourthquarter of 2002 and 14% from the first quarter of 2002. Global Treasury'sactivities complement, and offer a strategic balance and diversificationbenefit to, the Firm's trading activities. Equities total-return revenue was$436&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of 126% over the fourthquarter of 2002, but a slight decrease of 2% from the first quarter of 2002.The growth in equities compared with the prior quarter reflected improvedresults in derivatives. On an operating revenue basis, Capital Markets revenuesof $3.4&nbsp;billion in the first quarter were 27% above the fourth quarter of 2002and 18% above the first quarter of 2002.Credit costs were $246&nbsp;million for the quarter, down 50% from the fourthquarter of 2002 and 13% from the first quarter of 2002. The decrease from theprior quarter reflected lower net charge-offs, primarily in thetelecommunications sector, which experienced a high level of charge-offs in thefourth quarter of 2002. The decrease from the first quarter of 2002 was due tohigher recoveries in the first quarter of 2003. For additional information, seeCredit Risk Management on pages&nbsp;44-54.Operating expenses of $2.3&nbsp;billion for the first quarter decreased 1% from thefourth quarter of 2002 and increased 8% from the first quarter of 2002. Thedecline from the prior quarter reflected higher incentive compensation costs,due to higher earnings; these were more than offset by lower nonincentivecompensation expense and noncompensation expenses, driven by lower staffinglevels, professional fees, technology and communications expenses and traveland entertainment expenses. The declines reflect the impact of expensemanagement initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of 2002. Theinitiatives, which are approximately 80% complete, have resulted in a reductionof staffing levels of more than 1,700 since the third quarter of 2002. Includedin first quarter 2002 expenses were costs associated with the Sumitomolitigation settlement. Operating expenses in the first quarter of 2003 includedseverance and related costs of $104&nbsp;million, compared with $47&nbsp;million in thefirst quarter of last year and $338&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter. Includingthese severance and related costs, the overhead ratio for the first quarter was56%, compared with 69% in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 58% in the firstquarter of 2002. Excluding these costs, the overhead ratio for the quarter was54%, compared with 59% in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 56% in the firstquarter of 2002.Given the continued weakness in clientactivity and uncertain economicconditions, management remains cautious on the outlook for 2003.1 Derived from Thomson Financial Securities Data33 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)TREASURY & SECURITIES SERVICESFor a discussion of the profiles for each business within Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;T&SS&#148;), see pages 29&#150;30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report. Thefollowing table sets forth selected financial data of T&SS:bp &#150; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.T&SS had operating earnings of $147&nbsp;million, an increase of 8% from the fourthquarter of 2002 and 3% from the first quarter of 2002. Return on EconomicCapital for the quarter was 19% compared with 18% for the fourth quarter of2002 and 20% for the first quarter of 2002.Operating revenue was $966&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003, virtuallyunchanged from both the first and fourth quarters of 2002. Treasury Servicesrevenues increased from the first and fourth quarters of 2002 by 8% and 4%,respectively, due to growth in product revenue, notably in commercial andprepaid debit cards, higher balance deficiency fees and increased deposits.Partially offsetting these items was the decline in the value of deposits, theresult of lower interest rates. Investor Services revenues decreased 10% fromthe first quarter of 2002, as the business continued to be adversely affectedby difficult market conditions resulting in reduced balances, custody fees,foreign exchange revenue and securities lending activities. Revenues increased2% from the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to higher securities lendingand broker-dealer fees, as well as foreign exchange revenue resulting fromincreased volume. Institutional Trust Services revenues were up 1% from thefirst quarter of 2002, reflecting general business growth, partially offset bydeclines in American depositary receipt (&#147;ADR&#148;) and conventional debt activities; revenues decreased 9% fromthe fourth quarter of 2002, due to lower deposit balances and spreads coupledwith lower ADR volume.Operating expense was down 1% from the first and fourth quarters of 2002,reflecting continued focus on cost-containment measures that include Six Sigmaand productivity and quality initiatives and selected reductions in staff,particularly in Investor Services. The overhead ratio of 77% for the firstquarter improved slightly from the fourth quarter of 2002 and was in line withthe year-ago quarter.34 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT & PRIVATE BANKINGFor a discussion of the business profile of Investment Management & PrivateBanking (&#147;IMPB&#148;), see pages 31-32 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report. Thefollowing table reflects selected financial data of IMPB:bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM &#151; Not meaningfulInvestment Management & Private Banking had operating revenue of $652&nbsp;millionin the first quarter of 2003, which was 2% lower than the fourth quarter of2002 and 16% lower than the first quarter of 2002. Lower global equityvaluations (the S&P index was down 4% from fourth quarter 2002 and down 26%from first quarter 2002) and lower investor activity negatively affectedrevenues. Revenues for the first quarter included a gain on the sale of theBrazilian investment management business, offset by charges incurred atAmerican Century. Operating expense of $574&nbsp;million for the quarter was 8%below the fourth quarter and down 2% from the first quarter of 2002, the resultof merger and other expense savings initiatives implemented during 2002. Creditcosts of $6&nbsp;million were down from $13&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002and $23&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002.Operating earnings of $64&nbsp;million were up 49% from the fourth quarter but down50% from the first quarter of 2002. Pre-tax margin in the first quarter was11%, compared with 4% in the last quarter and 22% in the first quarter of 2002.Return on Economic Capital was 4%, compared with 3% in the fourth quarter 2002and 8% in the first quarter 2002. Tangible Return on Economic Capital was 14%,compared with 9% in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 27% in the first quarter of2002.The table below reflects the assets under supervision in IMPB as of March&nbsp;31, 2003:35 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Total assets under supervision at March&nbsp;31, 2003, of $622&nbsp;billion were 3% lowerthan at December&nbsp;31, 2002, and down 15% from March&nbsp;31, 2002. Assets undermanagement decreased from both fourth quarter and first quarter 2002 levels,reflecting market depreciation and institutional outflows. Not reflected inassets under management is the Firm's interest in American Century, whoseassets under management were $71&nbsp;billion at quarter-end, $72&nbsp;billion as of thefourth quarter of 2002 and $89&nbsp;billion as of the first quarter of 2002.JPMORGAN PARTNERSFor a discussion of the business profile of JPMorgan Partners, see pages 33-34of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report. The following table sets forth selectedfinancial data of JPMorgan Partners:NM &#151; Not meaningfulJPMorgan Partners had an operating loss of $224&nbsp;million for the 2003 firstquarter, compared with operating losses of $101&nbsp;million in the fourth quarterand $252&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2002.Total net private equity losses in the first quarter were $230&nbsp;million, ascompared with losses of $53&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $255million in the first quarter of 2002. Private equity market conditions remainmuted amid limited exit opportunities. In the current quarter, JPMP's directprivate equity investments recorded net losses of $136&nbsp;million, compared with anet gain of $27&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and a net loss of $236million in the first quarter of 2002. JPMP's direct private equity resultsincluded $46&nbsp;million in net realized cash gains, which were more than offset bywrite-downs and write-offs of $176&nbsp;million taken on direct private investmentpositions, and mark-to-market losses of $6&nbsp;million recorded on direct publicinvestments. Limited partner interests in third-party funds resulted in netlosses of $94&nbsp;million, compared with net losses of $80&nbsp;million and $19&nbsp;millionin the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2002, respectively. The currentmarket environment is likely to continue to contribute to write-downs andwrite-offs in the portfolio and limit exit opportunities. Management's target is to reduce the JPMP private equityportfolio from approximately 20% of the Firm's common stockholders' equity atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, to approximately 10% over time. Reductions in noncoreassets, such as investments in third-party funds, will be the primary driver in2003 to accomplish this targeted reduction. As a result of marketconditions and disposition of noncore assets, management believesthat private equity losses for 2003 could be similar to lastyear's levels.36 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Partners Investment PortfolioThe following table presents the carrying value and cost of the JPMP investmentportfolio for the dates indicated:The carrying value of technology, media and telecommunications (&#147;TMT&#148;)investments at March&nbsp;31, 2003, was $1.4&nbsp;billion, or 18% of the total portfolio,compared with $2.1&nbsp;billion, or 24% of the portfolio, at March&nbsp;31, 2002. Thisreduction was primarily the result of write-downs and write-offs in theportfolio. The carrying value of industrial growth investments increased to 28%of the total portfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2003, compared with 23% at March&nbsp;31, 2002,reflecting JPMP's increased investment in industrial buyout activity during theperiod.JPMP invested $172&nbsp;million for the Firm's account during the first quarter of 2003, with deal flow well diversified across all industry sectors.The industry group percentages in the accompanying table are based on thecarrying values of JPMP's private equity portfolio as of March&nbsp;31, 2003,December&nbsp;31, 2002, and March&nbsp;31, 2002. In terms of dollar amounts, someindustry sectors have the same, or lower, carrying values at March&nbsp;31, 2003, ascompared with December&nbsp;31, 2002 and March&nbsp;31, 2002, but these sectors comprise a higher percentage of the totalcarrying value of the March&nbsp;31, 2003, portfolio than they did atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002 and March&nbsp;31, 2002. This isthe result of the lower total carrying value of the JPMP portfolio asof March&nbsp;31, 2003.37 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CHASE FINANCIAL SERVICESFor a description of Chase Financial Services (&#147;CFS&#148;) and a discussion of theprofiles for each business, see pages 35-38 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 AnnualReport. The following table reflects selected financial data of CFS:(a)&nbsp;Includes credit card receivables that have been securitized.bp &#151; Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.Chase Financial Services' first quarter operating earnings were $704&nbsp;million,an increase of 42% from the 2002 fourth quarter and up 39% from the firstquarter of 2002. Return on Economic Capital for the first quarter was 28%,compared with 19% last quarter and 20% for the first quarter of 2002.Operating revenue was a record $3.7&nbsp;billion, up 11% from the 2002 fourthquarter and 21% from the first quarter of 2002. The increases were driven bycontinued high production volumes across all consumer credit businesses,partially offset by the negative impact of low interest rates on deposits. Thenational consumer credit businesses contributed 75% of the first quarter 2003operating revenue. Chase Home Finance reported record revenues in the firstquarter, which were up 116% over the prior year's first quarter, driven bystrong mortgage originations and, to a lesser extent, gains on the hedging ofmortgage servicing rights. Auto Finance also reported record revenues in thefirst quarter, up 17% from the first quarter of 2002, driven by higheroriginations and improved margins. Cardmember Services revenues were up 9% fromthe prior-year first quarter primarily reflecting growth in averageoutstandings; revenues decreased 7% from the fourth quarter of 2002 due toseasonal factors. Regional Banking and Middle Market were negatively affectedby lower interest rates, which resulted in lower spreads. While continuation ofthe low interest rate environment should enable the credit businesses withinChase Financial Services to perform well, it is likely that earnings for theremainder of 2003 will not continue at the first quarter 2003 level.Operating expense of $1.7&nbsp;billion for the quarter was up 2% compared with thefourth quarter of 2002 and increased 13% from the first quarter of 2002. Theincrease from the fourth quarter reflected higher business volumes,substantially offset by lower marketing costs and lower professional services.The increase from last year's first quarter reflected the impact of higherbusiness volumes, higher incentives due to better financial performance andincreased marketing costs. Savings generated by Six Sigma productivity programscontinued to partially offset the growth in expenses. CFS overhead ratio was47% compared with 51% for the fourth quarter of 2002 and 50% for the firstquarter of 2002 due to strong revenue growth and disciplined expensemanagement.Credit costs on a managed basis (including securitized credit cards) of $878million were up slightly compared to the 2002 fourth quarter and were 21%higher than the first quarter of 2002. The increase from last year's firstquarter reflected 10% higher charge-offs, driven by a 15% increase in averagemanaged loans. Credit costs for the first quarter of 2002 included a reductionin the allowance for loan losses primarily related to the run-off of aninstallment loan portfolio in Regional Banking. Delinquency rates in theconsumer loan portfolios have decreased compared with the fourth quarter of2002 and were essentially flat in comparison with the first quarter of 2002.38 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within CFS. For further information on the quarterlybusiness-related metrics of these businesses, see page 66.Chase Home FinanceAfter a record performance in 2002, Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;) continued toreport strong results in the first quarter of 2003, with record operatingrevenue of $1.1&nbsp;billion, an increase of 116% from the comparable quarter oflast year and 77% from the 2002 fourth quarter. During the first quarter, CHFcapitalized on record levels of residential first mortgage loan applicationsand originations, due primarily to historically low interest rates, continuingthe trend seen throughout 2002. Revenue growth was driven by high productionvolumes and favorable margins and, to a lesser extent, the positive impact ofrisk management activities when compared with prior periods. Managementanticipates an eventual decrease in revenues as interest rates,origination volumes and interest rate spreadsrevert to normal levels.Strong revenues were the result of CHF's continued expansion into strategicbusiness sectors such as home equity, where origination volumes increased 42%and 8% compared with the first quarter of 2002 and fourth quarter of 2002,respectively. Total origination volume was $62&nbsp;billion, an increase of 88% and2% from the first and fourth quarters of 2002, respectively. Loan originationsthrough higher margin channels (i.e., retail, wholesale, telephone-based ande-commerce) for the first quarter were $41&nbsp;billion, 78% and 3% higher than thefirst and fourth quarters of 2002, respectively. CHF's correspondentnegotiated transaction volume totaled $21 billion, an increase of110% compared with the first quarter of 2002 as a result of animprovement in market conditions and pricing.For the first quarter of 2003, MSR valuation adjustments of $473&nbsp;million weremore than offset by $559&nbsp;million of aggregate derivative gains, realized gainson sales of AFS securities, and net interest earned on AFS securities. The netpositive result of $86&nbsp;million for the firstquarter of 2003 compared with a negative $134&nbsp;millionand a negative $85&nbsp;million for the first and fourth quarters of 2002, respectively. Thefirst quarter results reflected continued strong management of the interestrate sensitivity of MSRs by CHF and the Firm's Global TreasuryGroup. During the first quarter of 2003, management revised itsmethodology, for internal reporting purposes, for allocating the MSR valuation adjustments andamortization betweenCHF's interest rate management activities and CHF's remaining revenue. The numbers abovereflect this revised methodology. While there was no impact onCHF's total revenue for the full-year 2002 of$2,929&nbsp;million, as a result of the reallocation the net positive result frommanagement of the interest rate sensitivity of MSRs was revised to$177 million from $582 million, and the remaining revenue for thebusiness was revised to $2,752&nbsp;million from $2,347&nbsp;million.Credit costs of $107&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2003 reflected anincrease in reserves for loan losses as a result of higher loan balances andcontinued weakness in the manufactured housing market. The net charge-off ratefor the first quarter of 2003 was 0.20%, down from 0.21% and 0.27% in the firstand fourth quarters of 2002, respectively.Operating earnings of $435&nbsp;million rose 235% versus the first quarter of 2002and 186% compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. CHF achieved record earningsduring the first quarter, exceeding by 12% the previous record of $390&nbsp;millionin the third quarter of 2002, due to significant revenue growth and strongexpense management.The carrying value of MSRs at March&nbsp;31, 2003, was unchanged from year-end 2002at $3.2&nbsp;billion. The Firm offsets the interest rate risk exposure in the MSRsby designating certain interest rate derivatives (i.e., a combination of swaps,swaptions and floors) as fair value hedges of specified MSRs under SFAS 133.AFS securities and certain &#147;nonhedge&#148; derivatives are also used to manage therisk exposure of the MSRs. For a furtherdiscussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 20.The mortgage servicing portfolio was $432&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003, anincrease of 1% compared with both the first and fourth quarters of 2002.39 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Chase Cardmember ServicesChase Cardmember Services' first quarter 2003 operating earnings were $157million, an increase of 11% from the first quarter of 2002 and 7% from thefourth quarter of 2002. These results were achieved in a challenging operatingenvironment, as evidenced by continued competitive pricing pressure, a softU.S. economy and higher bankruptcy filings.Operating revenue increased 9% from the first quarter of 2002 and was down 7%from the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in operating revenue from lastyear reflects higher average managed loans outstanding, a decline in fundingcosts due to historically low interest rates and continued growth in fee income(fee-based products, interchange and late fees). End-of-period managed loansincreased 3% from the first quarter of 2002 to more than $50&nbsp;billion. Totalvolume (purchases, balance transfers and cash advances) increased 10% from thefirst quarter of 2002. The positive momentum in new accounts continued withover one million accounts added in the first quarter. Operating revenuedeclined from the fourth quarter of 2002 due to seasonal factors.Operating expense increased 11% from the first quarter of 2002, reflectinghigher marketing investment and higher volume-related expenses. Operatingexpense was down 12% from the fourth quarter due primarily to lower marketingexpenses, which were at a record level in the fourth quarter.The managed net charge-off rate for the first quarter was 5.87%, up five basispoints and 12 basis points, respectively, from last year's first quarter andthe 2002 fourth quarter. The slight increase in the net charge-off rate fromthe first quarter of 2002 was due to higher contractual and bankruptcy losses,partly offset by receivable growth. The increase from last quarter reflectshigher contractual losses. The 30&#043; delinquency rate was 4.59% in the firstquarter of 2003, essentially flat with last year's first quarter and down eightbasis points from the fourth quarter of 2002.Chase Auto FinanceChase Auto Finance (&#147;CAF&#148;) results consist of the Auto Finance and EducationFinance businesses. CAF reported record revenue of$201&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 2003, up 17% from the 2002 first quarterand up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in revenue was drivenby strong operating performance due to higher average loans outstanding, lowerfunding costs and improved origination volumes. CAF experienced continued highlevels of auto loan and lease origination volume, which totaled $7.4&nbsp;billion inthe first quarter, a 28% increase from the first quarter of last year, and a 9%increase from the fourth quarter of 2002.CAF's operating earnings of $40&nbsp;million increased 29% from first quarter 2002and 8% from fourth quarter 2002. Credit costs increased primarily due to highervolumes. The credit quality of the portfolio has improved, as evidenced bycharge-off and 90&#043; delinquency rates, which were lower than in the first andfourth quarters of 2002.Chase Regional BankingChase Regional Banking's first quarter 2003 operating revenue of $630&nbsp;milliondeclined 13% from the first quarter of 2002 and 9% from the fourth quarter of2002. The decline in revenue is predominantly attributable to the lowerinterest rate environment and weak equity markets, which resulted in lower netinterest earned on deposit balances and lower fees earned on customerinvestment transactions and net asset values. Growth in retail deposits fromcontinuing operations of 8% from the first quarter of 2002 and 4% from thefourth quarter of 2002 partially offset the decline.Operating earnings of $35&nbsp;milliondeclined 69% compared with the 2002 firstquarter and declined 55% compared with the 2002 fourth quarter. The decline fromthe first quarter of 2002 was partly due to a one-time gain of $12&nbsp;million onthe sale of the National Deposit business to E*Trade in February 2002, and to areduction in the allowance for loan losses (related to the run-off of aninstallment loan portfolio) of $45&nbsp;million that occurred in the first quarterof 2002. The decline from the fourth quarter resulted from the lower netinterest earned on deposits as a result of the lower interest rate environment.Operating expense was up 1% from the first quarter of 2002 and down 1% comparedto the fourth quarter of 2002.Chase Middle MarketChase Middle Market's operating revenues of $369&nbsp;million in the first quarterof 2002 decreased 2% compared with the first quarter of 2002 and increased 1%compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. The decrease from last year was theresult of the lower interest rate environment, partially offset by higherdeposit levels and capital markets fees. The increase from the fourth quarterwas due to higher deposits.Operating earnings were up 8% from the first quarter of 2002 and 52% from thefourth quarter of 2002. The increase from the first and fourth quarters of 2002was primarily attributable to a release of the allowance for loan losses of $28million, which resulted in a negative provision for credit costs, due toimprovement in the quality of the loan portfolio.40 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's Support Units and Corporate sector includes EnterpriseTechnology Services, legal, audit, corporate finance, human resources, riskmanagement and corporate marketing. For a further discussion of the businessprofiles of these Support Units as well as a description of Corporate, see page39 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.NM &#151; Not meaningfulCorporate reflects the accounting effects remaining at the corporate levelafter the application of management accounting policies of the Firm. Thesepolicies include the allocation of costs associated with technology,operational and staff support services to the respective revenue-generatingbusinesses and allow management to evaluate business performance on anallocated basis.Effective April&nbsp;1, 2003, JPMorgan Chase commenced a seven-year outsourcingagreement with IBM to provide a portion of the Firm's data processingtechnology infrastructure. This agreement will result in absolute cost savings, increased costvariability, access to the best research and innovation and improved servicelevels. The impact on total expenses as a result of this agreement is expected to besmall in 2003; however, compensation expense will decrease, asemployees will be transferred to IBM, and noncompensation expensewill increase as a result of this agreement.The Corporate segment usually operates at a loss, generally as a result of theoverallocation of capital to the other business sectors and the overallocationof revenues that arise from the application of funds transfer pricing and othermanagement accounting policies. Expense items usually result from timingdifferences in allocations to other business sectors and residuals frominteroffice allocation among the business segments. The impact of managementaccounting policies on Corporate is being reviewed. It is management'sintention that, as a result of such review, a significant portion ofthe revenues (or losses) and expensescurrently recorded within the Corporate segment will be allocated tothe other business sectors. Prior periods will be restated uponcompletion of the review.Although the Corporate segment has no traditional credit assets, the residualcomponent of the allowance for credit losses is maintained at the corporatelevel and is not allocated to any specific line of business. Similarly, for2003, credit costs reflected the difference between the aggregate provisionrecorded at the consolidated level and the provision allocated to the businesssegments. For a further discussion of the residual component, see pages 53-54.41 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENTJPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational,business, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion of these risksand definitions of terms associated with managing these risks, see pages 40-65and the Glossary of Terms in JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTCAPITAL MANAGEMENTEconomic capital:JPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy utilizing internal risk assessmentmethodologies. The Firm assigns economic capital based primarily on four riskfactors: credit, market and operating risk for each business and, for JPMP,private equity risk. The methodology quantifies these risks and assigns capitalaccordingly. Additionally, the Firm assesses capital against certain nonriskfactors, which are not captured through its other risk assessment measures.Commencing in the second quarterof 2003, the Firm is expecting to revise its capital measurement methodologiesfor commercial credit risk, operational risk, business risk andprivate equity risk. These new methodologies may change the level ofcapital allocated to the business segments in relation to each other,but are not expected to result in a significant change in the total capitalallocated to the businesses as a whole or imply a need for additional capital by theFirm. For a further discussion, see pages&nbsp;54 and 57.Capital in excess of required economic capital, at March&nbsp;31, 2003, increased by$1.4&nbsp;billion over March&nbsp;31, 2002, primarily due to an increase in commonstockholders' equity. Market risk capital declined over the period, due tolower stress and VAR results in several businesses in the Investment Bank andChase Home Finance. This was offset by an increase in operating risk capital,due to a combination of higher operating expenses and higher capital factorsfrom lower average audit scores across certain businesses.The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on the developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should be read inconjunction with page 41 and Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 AnnualReport.Regulatory CapitalJPMorgan Chase's risk-based capital ratios at March&nbsp;31, 2003, were well inexcess of minimum regulatory guidelines. At March&nbsp;31, 2003, Tier&nbsp;1 and TotalCapital ratios were 8.4% and 12.2%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 5.0%. At March&nbsp;31, 2003, the total capitalization of JPMorgan Chase (thesum of Tier&nbsp;1 and Tier&nbsp;2 Capital) was $55.7&nbsp;billion, an increaseof $1.2&nbsp;billion from December&nbsp;31, 2002. This increase principally reflected a $0.9&nbsp;billionincrease in Tier&nbsp;1 Capital, reflecting $0.7&nbsp;billion in retainedearnings (net income less common and preferred dividends) generated during theperiod and the net stock issuance of $0.2&nbsp;billion related to employee benefitplans. The remaining increase in total capital primarily reflected an increase in thesubordinated debt component of Tier&nbsp;2 capital.The Firm did not repurchase shares of its common stock during the first threemonths of 2003.42 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)DividendsIn the first quarter of 2003, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cash dividendon its common stock of $0.34 per share payable April&nbsp;30, 2003, to stockholdersof record at the close of business April&nbsp;4, 2003. The dividend declared in anyquarter will be determined by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors. The Board ofDirectors expressed its intent on September&nbsp;17, 2002, to continue the currentdividend level, provided that capital ratios remain strong and earningsprospects exceed the current dividend.LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should be read inconjunction with pages 42-43 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.In managing liquidity, management considers a variety of liquidity riskmeasures as well as market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidityneeds and the desired maturity profile of its liabilities.JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management framework utilizes liquidity monitoringtools and a contingency funding plan to maintain appropriate levels ofliquidity through normal and stress periods. The parent company's liquiditypolicy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet funding requirements fornormal operating activities and to repay all obligations with a maturity of oneyear and under. In addition, JPMorgan Chase maintains appropriate liquidity tomanage through normal and stress periods, taking into account historical dataon funding of loan commitments (i.e., commercial paper back-up facilities),liquidity commitments to conduits and collateral-posting requirements. Sourcesof funds include the capital markets, the operations of the Firm's subsidiaries(including the ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank to raise funds through deposits)and securitization programs.The Firm has, for several quarters, been managing its liquidity in light of theweak capital markets environment. Consistent with its policy, the Firm hasraised funds at the holding company sufficient to cover maturing obligationsover the next 12&nbsp;months. Long-term funding needs for the parent holding companyover the next several quarters are expected to be modest.Credit Ratings: JPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorgan ChaseBank's credit ratings as of April&nbsp;30, 2003, were as follows:As of April&nbsp;30, 2003, the ratings outlook for the parent holding company byMoody's Investor Services (&#147;Moody's&#148;) was stable, and the ratings outlook forthe parent holding company by Standard & Poor's (&#147;S&P&#148;) and Fitch, Inc.(&#147;Fitch&#148;) was negative.Balance Sheet: The Firm's total assets decreased to $755&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31,2003, from $759&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. Automobile financing andresidential consumer loans increased due to higher originations, partiallyoffset by consumer loan securitizations; commercial loans declined, reflectingweaker loan demand and the Firm's ongoing efforts to reduce commercialexposures. Debt and equity trading assets declined, partially offset byincreases in Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resaleagreements, securities borrowed and risk management instruments. The lowerasset levels resulted in the need for lower balances in Federal funds purchasedand securities sold under repurchase agreements and trading liabilities.Issuance: During the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, JPMorgan Chase issuedapproximately $6.6&nbsp;billion of long-term debt; during the same period, $3.9billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed. In addition, the Firmsecuritized approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans and $1.5billion of credit card loans, resulting in pre-tax gains on securitizations of$49.3&nbsp;million and $12.7&nbsp;million, respectively. For a further discussion of loansecuritizations, see Note 8, and Note 11 on pages 83-87 of JPMorgan Chase's2002 Annual Report.43 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsSpecial-purpose entities or special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;) are an importantpart of the financial markets, providing market liquidity by facilitatinginvestors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. JPMorgan Chase isinvolved with SPEs in three broad categories of transactions: loansecuritizations, multi-seller conduits and client intermediation. Capital isheld, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and exposures suchas derivative transactions and lending commitments. The Firm has no commitmentsto issue its own stock to support an SPE transaction, and its policies requirethat transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm's length and reflect marketpricing. For a further discussion of SPEs and the Firm's accounting for SPEs,see Note 8.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required toprovide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgradedbelow specific levels, primarily A-1, P-1 and F-1. The amount of theseliquidity commitments was $44.1&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003; $31.7&nbsp;billionrelated to the Firm's multi-seller conduits and structured commercial loanvehicles, further described in Note 8. The total commercial paper outstandingfor the multi-seller conduits and structured commercial loan vehicles was $22.6billion and $24.7&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003, and December&nbsp;31, 2002,respectively. The remaining $12.4&nbsp;billion in commitments relate to vehiclesestablished by third parties. If JPMorgan Chase Bank is required to providefunding under these commitments, the Firm could be replaced as liquidityprovider. Additionally, for the multi-seller conduits and the structuredcommercial loan vehicles, JPMorgan Chase Bank could facilitate the sale orrefinancing of the assets in the SPE. All of these commitments are included inthe Firm's total $192.1&nbsp;billion in other unfunded commitments to extend credit,described in more detail in Note 21.The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase's off-balance sheetlending-related financial instruments at March&nbsp;31, 2003, and December&nbsp;31, 2002:CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk profile as of March31, 2003, focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and shouldbe read in conjunction with pages 45-57, pages 65-66 and Notes 9, 10, 29 and 30of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.The Firm assesses its credit exposures on a managed basis, taking into accountthe impact of credit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of credit costson a managed, or operating, basis to reported results, see page 30. Thefollowing table presents the Firm's managed credit-related information for thedates indicated.44 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CREDIT PORTFOLIOThe following table presents a summary of managed credit-related informationfor the dates indicated:JPMorgan Chase's total credit exposure (including $31&nbsp;billion of securitizedcredit cards) totaled $566&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003, a slight decline from$568&nbsp;billion at year-end 2002. The decline reflected a 3% decrease incommercial loans and lending-related commitments, offset by a 3% increase inmanaged consumer loans, and a 4% increase in derivative receivables.45 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The 3% decline in commercial loans and unfunded lending-related commitmentslargely reflected a combination of continued weak loan demand and the Firm'songoing goal of reducing its commercial credit exposure concentrations.Total commercial exposure (loans, derivative receivables, unfundedlending-related commitments and Enron-related other receivables) was $406billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003, compared with $413&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. AtMarch&nbsp;31, 2003, 82% of the Firm's commercial credit exposure was consideredinvestment-grade; 0.9% of this exposure was nonperforming. This compares with80% investment-grade exposure at year-end 2002 and 1.0% nonperforming atyear-end 2002.Commercial Criticized ExposureThe criticized component of total commercial exposure declined $2.0&nbsp;billionduring the quarter, due largely to a number of successful restructurings inmerchant energy and related industries ($0.9&nbsp;billion), reductions in criticizedexposures across a broad number of other industries ($0.8&nbsp;billion) andreductions in emerging markets exposures ($0.3&nbsp;billion). See thetrend graph on page&nbsp;48.Total commercial nonperforming assets were $3.7&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003,which included $347&nbsp;million related to Enron. The $398&nbsp;million decline innonperforming assets for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, was largelydriven by charge-offs and the restructuring of several large nonperformingexposures. Commercial loan net charge-offs for the three months ended March&nbsp;31,2003, were $292&nbsp;million, compared with $434&nbsp;million for the three months endedDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, and $320&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2002.The charge-off ratio for commercial loans was 1.32% for the first quarter of2003, compared with 1.88% for the fourth quarter of 2002 and 1.27% for thefirst quarter of 2002.While the economic and associatedcredit environments are excepted to remain challenging in 2003, theFirm has seen an improvement in its commercial credit profile, andthus continues to anticipate commercial charge-offs in 2003 will notreach 2002 levels.Below are summaries of the maturity and risk profiles of the commercialportfolio as of March&nbsp;31, 2003. Ratings are based on the Firm's internal riskratings, presented on an S&P-equivalent basis. For additional information, seepage 47 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.46 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The aggregate risk profile of the Firm's total commercial credit exposureimproved during the first quarter of 2003, with the investment-grade componentof the total portfolio increasing from 80% to 82%. This was largely driven by achange in mix and improvement in the risk profile of all components ofcommercial credit exposure: the investment-grade component of the commercialloan portfolio improved from 55% to 57%, the derivative receivables portfoliofrom 87% to 90% and the lending-related commitments portfolio from 87% to 89%.Commercial Credit Exposure Select Industry ConcentrationsThe Firm continues to focus on the management and diversification of itsindustry concentrations, with particular attention focused on exposures toindustries deemed or anticipated to have higher levels of risk. A discussionof the Firm's exposure to selected industries as of March&nbsp;31, 2003, versusDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, is set forth below.Telecom and Related IndustriesThe Firm continues to actively manage its exposure to this sector. Totalexposure remained essentially flat for the first three months of 2003, and theinvestment-grade component of the portfolio improved from 56% as of year-end2002 to 66% as of March&nbsp;31, 2003. This was driven by improvements in the riskprofiles of select exposures. Criticized exposure remained essentially flat,with the downgrade of one large non-U.S. exposure to criticized performing,partially offset by the restructuring of one nonperforming exposure.47 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Merchant Energy & Related IndustriesAfter experiencing significant growth in the criticized component of thisportfolio during the last six months of 2002, the Firm reduced exposures deemedcriticized by $867&nbsp;million in the first three months of 2003, through acombination of successful restructurings and collateralizations of exposures.The noninvestment-grade, noncriticized component increased from 7% to 17%, dueto restructuring. The investment-grade component of the portfolio also improvedduring the quarter, from 57% to 61%, largely driven by new investment-gradetransactions.CableThe decline of $670&nbsp;million in aggregate exposure in this portfolio during thefirst quarter of 2003 was due to the repayment of investment-gradetransactions, resulting in a reduction in the investment-grade component of theportfolio from 45% to 40%. Total criticized exposure remained essentially flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial CriticizedExposureTrend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;($&nbsp;in billions)Enron-related exposureAt March&nbsp;31, 2003, the Firm's Enron-related exposure was as follows:Of the $144&nbsp;million in lending-related commitments, $125&nbsp;million relates todebtor-in-possession financing. The $108&nbsp;million in Other Assets relates to theletter of credit that is the subject of litigation. Trading Assets (bothperforming and nonperforming) are carried at fair value. Secured loans areperforming and are reported on an amortized cost basis. All unsecured amountsare nonperforming; nonperforming loans have been written down toreflect management's estimate of current recoverable value, and nonperformingOther Assets are being carried at their current estimated realizable value inaccordance with SFAS 5.48 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Derivative ContractsFor a further discussion of the derivative contracts utilized by JPMorgan Chasein connection with its trading and end-user activities, see Note 20, and pages50&#150;53 and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and derivativereceivables (i.e., the mark-to-market or fair value of the derivative contractafter taking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the dates indicated:Notional amounts and derivative receivablesThe $28&nbsp;trillion of notional principal of the Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at March&nbsp;31, 2003 is not relevant in the Firm's viewto the possible credit losses that could arise from such transactions. Formost derivative transactions, the notional principal amount does notchange hands; it is simply used as a reference to calculate payments. In the Firm'sview, the appropriate measure of current credit risk at March&nbsp;31, 2003, is the$87&nbsp;billion mark-to-market (&#147;MTM&#148;) value of derivative receivables (aftertaking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements), less the $34&nbsp;billion of collateral held by the Firm, or $53billion, which represents the net current credit exposure. This compares, atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, to a MTM value of derivative receivables of $83&nbsp;billion,collateral held by the Firm of $30&nbsp;billion, and a net current credit exposureof $53&nbsp;billion.While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net MTM value of thederivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability ofthat credit exposure. The &#147;market-diversified peak&#148; of $57&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31,2003, and $57&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, represents the maximum loss(estimated at the 97.5% confidence level) that would occur if allcounterparties were to default over a one-year time horizon without anyrecovery, taking into account both collateral and netting. Since, generally,all counterparties would not default concurrently, nor would all default whentheir exposures are at peak levels, in the Firm's view, this is a conservativemeasure of its potential future derivatives credit risk.The MTM value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates a CreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;) to reflect the credit quality of counterparties.The CVA was $1.2&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003 compared with $1.3&nbsp;billion at December31, 2002. The CVA is based on the expected future exposure (incorporatingnetting and collateral) to a counterparty, and the counterparty's credit spreadin the credit derivatives market. The net impact of the change in CVA, plus theresults of related risk management hedging activity, is accounted for intrading revenue and was not material to the overall trading results of theFirm.The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of March&nbsp;31, 2003, of theFirm's Consolidated Balance Sheet exposure to derivative and foreign exchangecontracts, net of cash and other highly liquid collateral held by the Firm.Ratings below are based upon the Firm's internal risk ratings and are presentedon an S&P-equivalent basis:49 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Approximately two-thirds of the Firm's derivatives transactions at March&nbsp;31,2003, have associated collateral arrangements. The Firm held $34&nbsp;billion ofcollateral at March&nbsp;31, 2003, compared with $30&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002.The Firm posted $18&nbsp;billion of collateral at March&nbsp;31, 2003, compared with$19&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. In addition, derivative and collateralagreements include provisions that require both the Firm and the counterparty,upon specified downgrades in their respective credit ratings, to postcollateral for the benefit of the other party. The impact on requiredcollateral of a single-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bankfrom its current rating of AA- to A+ would have been an additional$1.1&nbsp;billion of collateral as of March&nbsp;31, 2003. The impactof a six-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- toBBB-) would have been $3.4&nbsp;billion of additional collateral fromcurrent levels as of March&nbsp;31, 2003. Certain derivativecontracts also provide for termination of the contract, generallyupon JPMorgan Chase Bank being downgraded, at the then-existingmark-to-market value of the derivative receivables.Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the notional amounts of credit derivativesprotection bought and sold at March&nbsp;31, 2003:Credit derivatives activityJPMorgan Chase has modest counterparty exposure as a result of creditderivatives transactions. Of the $87&nbsp;billion of total derivative receivables atMarch&nbsp;31, 2003, approximately $4&nbsp;billion, or 5%, was associated with creditderivatives, before the benefit of collateral. The use of derivatives to manageexposures does not reduce the reported level of assets on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheet or the level of reported off-balance sheet commitments.Portfolio management activityJPMorgan Chase's commercial credit portfolio is composed of credit exposures toclients arising from both lending and derivatives activities. In managing thisportfolio, single-name and portfolio credit derivatives are purchased by theCredit Portfolio Group to hedge these exposures. As of March&nbsp;31, 2003, thenotional outstanding amount of protection purchased via single-name andportfolio credit derivatives was $27&nbsp;billion and $10&nbsp;billion, respectively. TheFirm also diversifies its exposures by providing (i.e., selling) small amountsof credit protection, which increases exposure to industries or clients wherethe Firm has little or no client-related exposure. This activity is notmaterial to the Firm's overall credit exposure, and credit protection soldtotaled $412&nbsp;million in notional exposure at March&nbsp;31, 2003.JPMorgan Chase's use of credit derivatives for its portfolio managementactivities related to loans and lending-related commitments does not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Thesederivatives are marked-to-market in Trading Revenue, whereas the loans andlending-related commitments being hedged are accounted for on an accrual basisin Net Interest Income. This asymmetry in accounting treatment between loansand lending-related commitments and the derivatives utilized in the portfoliomanagement activities causes earnings volatility that is not representative ofthe true changes in value of the Firm's overall credit exposures. Themark-to-market treatment of both the Firm's derivatives hedges (&#147;short&#148; creditpositions) and derivatives counterparty exposure (&#147;long&#148; credit positions)provide some natural offset of each other. Included in Trading Revenue arelosses of $110&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2003 related to creditderivatives that were used to hedge the Firm's credit exposure. Of the $110million, approximately $71&nbsp;million was associated with credit derivatives usedto hedge accrual lending activities. These losses were driven by an overallglobal tightening of credit spreads. Since the first quarter of 2002,the quarterly hedge performance results have ranged from a loss of$318&nbsp;million, when credit spreads contracted, to a gain of$246&nbsp;million when they widened. Trading Revenues incorporate both the costof hedge premiums and changes in value due to spread movement and creditevents.50 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Dealer Client ActivityAs of March&nbsp;31, 2003, the total notional amounts of protection purchased andsold by the dealer business were $180&nbsp;billion and $191&nbsp;billion, respectively.The mismatch between these notional amounts is attributable to the Firm sellingprotection on large, diversified, predominantly investment-grade portfolios(including the most senior tranches) and then hedging these positions by buyingprotection on the more subordinated tranches of the same portfolios. Inaddition, the Firm may use securities to hedge certain derivative positions.Consequently, while there is a mismatch in notional amounts of creditderivatives, in the Firm's view, the risk positions are largely matched. Theamount of credit risk contributed by the Firm's credit derivatives dealeractivity is immaterial in the context of JPMorgan Chase's overall creditexposures.Country ExposureThe Firm has a comprehensive process for measuring and managing its countryexposures and risk. The table below presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure toselected countries. This disclosure is based on management's view of countryexposure. Exposure amounts are adjusted for credit enhancements (e.g.,guarantees and letters of credit) provided by third parties located outside thecountry, if the enhancements fully cover the country risk, as well as thecommercial risk. Exposures to a country include all credit-related lending,trading and investment activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Inaddition, country exposure includes exposure to both government andprivate-sector entities in a country.During the first quarter of 2003, withthe exception of Mexico and Japan, the Firm'sselected country exposure levels remained relatively stable or declinedcompared with the previous quarter. Exposure to Mexico and Japan fluctuate considerablyas a result of trading activities. In the first quarter of 2003, increased bondtrading positions on the Firm's local balance sheets drove theoverall increasesin exposure to both Mexico and Japan. The continued reduction in exposure to Brazil wasprimarily due to country exposure hedges in the trading account. Inboth South Korea and Hong Kong, exposure declined as a result of reductions inboth lending and trading positions. Exposure to Saudi Arabia declined due to areduction in loans.The following table presents JPMorgan Chase's exposure to selected countries:Selected country exposure51 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CONSUMER PORTFOLIOJPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio continues to be primarily domestic and isgeographically well-diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfoliototaled $160.4&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003, an increase of approximately $4.9billion since year-end 2002. Consumer net charge-offs on a managed basis were$835&nbsp;million and $754&nbsp;million for the first quarters of 2003 and 2002,respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in credit card netcharge-offs due, in part, to a higher level of outstandings. The Firm continuesto anticipate higher charge-offs in its consumer loan portfolio in 2003resulting from increases in loans outstanding.The following discussion relates to the specific loan categories within theconsumer portfolio:Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $67.1&nbsp;billion atMarch&nbsp;31, 2003, a $3.1&nbsp;billion increase from the 2002&nbsp;year-end. Nonperforming1-4&nbsp;family residential mortgage loans decreased $9&nbsp;million from year-end. Thenet charge-off rate of 0.04% for the first quarter of 2003 decreased from 0.09%compared with first quarter 2002. At March&nbsp;31, 2003, the Firm had $2.2&nbsp;billionof sub-prime residential mortgage loans, of which $1.6&nbsp;billion were held forsale. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, sub-prime residential mortgage loans outstandingwere $1.8&nbsp;billion, of which $1.3&nbsp;billion were held for sale.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheet as well as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed credit card receivables were approximately $48.9&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31,2003, a decrease of 1% (before giving effect to the transfer of accrued fees toOther Assets), compared with year-end 2002. The lower amount of receivablesprimarily reflects seasonal factors. During the 2003 first quarter, netcharge-offs as a percentage of average credit card receivables increased to5.95%, compared with 5.87% for the first quarter of 2002. Loans over90&nbsp;days past due decreased to 1.91% of the portfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2003,compared with 2.14% at December&nbsp;31, 2002. Excluding the transfer of accruedfees, the 90&#043; delinquency rate was essentially unchanged at March&nbsp;31, 2003,when compared with December&nbsp;31, 2002.Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding increased by $3.3&nbsp;billion at March31, 2003, when compared with year-end 2002. This increase was driven byoriginations of $7.4&nbsp;billion during the first quarter of 2003, a 28% increaseover originations in the comparable period in 2002. The net charge-off rate of0.53% for the 2003 first quarter continues to reflect the Firm'sselective approach to asset origination in this portfolio.52 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans of $7.6&nbsp;billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003,increased 1% compared with year-end levels. The net charge-off rate related tothis portfolio increased in the 2003 first quarter to 2.54% from 2.16% in thefirst quarter of 2002, as a result of charge-offs in a discontinued installmentloan portfolio and higher charge-offs in the manufactured housing portfolio.Summary of changes in the allowanceLoans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of March&nbsp;31, 2003, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.The allowance has both specific and expected loss components and a residualcomponent to reflect the credit quality in the Firm's loan portfolio.As of March&nbsp;31, 2003, management deemed the allowance to be adequate (i.e.,sufficient to absorb losses thatcurrently may exist but are not yet identifiable). The allowance represented2.40% of loans at March&nbsp;31, 2003, compared with 2.47% at year-end 2002. Theallowance for loan losses declined by $135&nbsp;million from year-end 2002, comparedwith an increase of $210&nbsp;million from March&nbsp;31, 2002.The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $1.5&nbsp;billion atMarch&nbsp;31, 2003, a decrease of $75&nbsp;million, or 5%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease was primarily attributable to charge-offs taken, and restructuringsarranged, during the quarter.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $590&nbsp;million atMarch&nbsp;31, 2003, a decrease of $23&nbsp;million, or 4%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease reflected a reduction in the amount, and an improvement in the averagequality, of the noncriticized portion of the portfolio.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.3&nbsp;billion at March31, 2003, a decline of $105&nbsp;million, or 4%, from year-end 2002. The decreasewas primarily attributable to the transfer of the allowance for accrued fees onsecuritized credit card loans to Other Assets.53 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The residual component of the allowance was $842&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2003, anincrease of $68&nbsp;million, or 9%, from year-end 2002. Management views theresidual component as necessary to address uncertainties inherent in the creditportfolio at March&nbsp;31, 2003, primarily in the commercial portfolio.At March&nbsp;31, 2003, the residual component represented approximately 16% ofthe total allowance for loan losses, within the Firm's target range of between10% and 20%.Lending-Related Commitments: To provide for the risk of loss inherent in thecredit-extension process, management also computes specific and expected losscomponents, as well as a residual component, for lending-related commitments.These are computed using a methodology similar to that used for the loanportfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown. Thisallowance, which is reported in Other Liabilities, was $436&nbsp;million, $363million and $281&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2003, December&nbsp;31, 2002, and March&nbsp;31,2002, respectively. The allowance increased by $73&nbsp;million in the first quarterof 2003 due to deterioration in the criticized portion of the Firm'slending-related commitments. For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, therewere no charge-offs of lending-related commitments by the Firm.Capital Allocation for Credit RiskIn the second quarter of 2003, the Firm will implement a revisedcapital measurement methodology for the assessment of credit risk capitalallocated to its commercial credit portfolio, more closely aligning capitalwith market conditions, thereby assessing credit risk at bothinception of a credit extension and on an ongoing market-drivenbasis. The Firm expects this approach to enhance the management of commercialcredit risk, utilizing both the growing market in creditderivatives as well as secondary market loan sales. The Firm willemphasize current, market-based estimates of default likelihood and credit deterioration implied from credit spreads andequity prices, rather than historical averages. Concurrently, thisassessment will incorporate the valuation impact of credit deterioration, aswell as anticipated losses associated with default. Depending on marketconditions, the Firm's assessment of credit risk capital is expected to vary withchanges in credit spreads in the market.The revised methodology is expected to increasethe amount of risk-based capital allocated to the commercial portfolio; this is expectedto be implemented concurrent with changes in risk-based capitalallocated for operational risk, business risk and private equityrisk. The new methodologies may change the level of capital allocatedto the business segments in relation to each other, but are notexpected to result in a significant change in the total capitalallocated to the businesses as a whole.

Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensiveVAR calculation that includes its trading, investment and asset/liability(&#147;A/L&#148;) management activities. The Firm calculated the VAR numbers reportedbelow using a one-day time horizon and a 99% confidence level. This means theFirm would expect to incur losses greater than that predicted by VAR estimatesonly once every 100 trading days, or about 2.5 times a year. For the quarterended March&nbsp;31, 2003, there were no days on which actual Firmwide marketrisk-related losses exceeded corporate VAR. For a further discussion of theFirm's VAR methodology, see pages 58&#150;60 of the 2002 Annual Report.54 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thetable below provides a meaningful overview of the Firm's market risk exposurearising from trading activities and the investment and A/L portfolios.Aggregate PortfolioThe daily average Trading Portfolio VAR for the first quarter of 2003 was $53.7million. The largest contributor was interest rate risk, which includes creditspread risk; before portfolio diversification, interest rate risk accounted for61% of the average VAR. The diversification effect, which averaged$(34.5) million in the first quarter of 2003, reflects the fact that thelargest losses for different positions and risks do not typically occur at thesame time. The risk of a portfolio of positions is therefore usually less thanthe sum of the risks of the positions themselves. The degree of diversificationis determined both by the extent to which different market variables tend tomove together, and by the extent to which different businesses have similarpositions. The decline in average Trading Portfolio VAR since the fourthquarter of 2002 was driven primarily by reduced position-taking in interestrate businesses.VARs for the investment portfolio and A/L activities measure the amount ofpotential change in their economic value; however, they are not measures ofreported revenues since those activities are not marked-to-market throughearnings. The increase in average VAR for the investment portfolio and A/Lactivities since the fourth quarter of 2002 resulted primarily from refinementsin measuring the spread between mortgage rates and Libor/swap rates andincreased exposure to increasing interest rates.55 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)HistogramThe histogram below illustrates the Firm's daily market risk-related revenue,defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-market trading portfoliosplus any trading-related Net Interest Income, brokerage commissions,underwriting fees or other revenue. The chart shows that the Firm postedpositive daily market risk-related revenue for all 63&nbsp;days of the first quarterof 2003, with 49&nbsp;days exceeding $25&nbsp;million. There were no losses sustained onany of the 63 trading days. The average daily market risk-related revenueduring the first quarter of 2003 was $48.4&nbsp;million.To evaluate the soundness of its VAR model, the Firm conducts dailyback-testing of VAR against actual financial results, based on daily marketrisk-related revenue. Since the Firm posted positive daily market risk-relatedrevenue for all 63&nbsp;days of the first quarter of 2003, there were no days whenlosses exceeded VAR.Stress TestingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. The Firm stress tests its portfolios at least once a month,at both the corporate and business segment levels, using multiple scenarios.Scenarios are continually reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the Firm'srisk profile and economic events. The following table represents the potentialeconomic value stress-test loss (pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfoliopredicted by JPMorgan Chase's stress-test scenarios:Largest Monthly Stress Test Loss &#150; Pre-TaxEconomic-value stress tests are performed at varying dates each month; thestress-test results at March&nbsp;13, 2003, were mostly driven by exposuressensitive to a stress scenario in which interest rates rise in the majorcurrencies and, at the same time, credit spreads increase and equity pricesdecline. The largest components of the stress-test results were long interestrate positions in North America and Europe, as well as interest rate optionpositions in North America. The long interest rate positions includedgovernment bonds, swaps and mortgages. The increase in average stress-test lossin the first quarter of 2003, versus the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002, wasdriven primarily by increased exposure to option positions. Subsequent to March13, 2003, the Firm took actions to reduce its stress-test loss risksubstantially by March&nbsp;31, 2003.56 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)It is important to note that VAR results cannot be directly correlated tostress-test loss results for three reasons. First, stress-test losses arecalculated at varying dates each month, while VAR is performed daily andreported for the period-end date. Second, VAR and stress tests are two distinctrisk measurements yielding very different loss potentials. Thus, although thesame trading portfolios are used for both tests, VAR is based on a distributionof one-day historical losses measured over the most recent one year; incontrast, stress testing subjects the portfolio to more extreme, larger movesover a longer time horizon (i.e., 2&#150;3&nbsp;weeks). Third, as VAR and stress testsare distinct risk measurements, the impact of portfolio diversification canvary greatly. For VAR, markets can change in patterns over a one-year timehorizon, moving from highly correlated to less so; in stress testing, the focusis on a single event and the associated correlations in an extreme marketsituation. As a result, while VAR over a given time horizon can be lowered by adiversification benefit in the portfolio, this benefit would not necessarilymanifest itself in stress-test scenarios, which assume large coherent movesacross all markets. For a further discussion of the Firm's stress testingmethodology see pages 60&#150;61 of the 2002 Annual Report.The Firm conducts both economic-value and Net Interest Income (&#147;NII&#148;) stresstests on its investment portfolios and A/L activities, which are not accountedfor on a mark-to-market basis. The more conventional NII stress test measuresthe potential change in the Firm's NII over the next year. For the quarterended March&nbsp;31, 2003, JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NII stress-test losswas estimated at $292&nbsp;million, primarily the result of potential compression indeposit spreads associated with further rate declines from the current low-rateenvironment. Economic-value stress tests measure the potential change in thevalue of these portfolios under the same scenarios used to evaluate the tradingportfolios. For the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, JPMorgan Chase's largestpotential economic-value stress-test loss on its investment portfolios and A/Lactivities, excluding consumer loans, was associated with a scenario thatassumes a sharp widening in credit spreads and decreases in interest rates.Other statistical and nonstatistical risk measuresFor a discussion of the Firm's other risk measures, see page 61 of JPMorganChase's 2002 Annual Report.Capital allocation for market riskFor a discussion of the Firm's capital allocation for market risk, see page 61of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Risk monitoring and controlFor a discussion of the Firm's risk monitoring and control process, includinglimits, qualitative risk assessments, model review, and policies andprocedures, see page 62 of the 2002 Annual Report.OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENTThe Firm intends to implement a new risk-based capital allocation methodologyfor operational and business risks during the second quarter of 2003. This newmethodology is expected to result in an overall lower amount ofcapital allocated to the businesses in respect of these risks. For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's operationalrisk management, refer to pages 63&#150;64 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe Firm intends to refine its methodology formeasuring private equity risk during the second quarter of 2003. Thisis expected to result in a moderately higher amount of capitalallocated to JPMP. For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity risk management, refer topage 65 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1 through 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Form&nbsp;10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries could pay dividends to their respective bankholding companies, without the approval of their relevant banking regulators,in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $2.4billion at March&nbsp;31, 2003.57 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRMThe Firm's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral tounderstanding the reported results. The Firm's most complex accountingestimates require management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assetsand liabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and controlprocedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgmentsmade as part of such methods, are well controlled, independently reviewed andapplied consistently from period to period. In addition, the policies andprocedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologiesoccurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates fordetermining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. For afurther description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involvingsignificant management valuation judgments, see pages 65&#150;67 and the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements in JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Allowance for Credit LossesThe Firm's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assignedto a loan. Assuming, for all commercial loans, a one-notch downgrade in theFirm's internal risk ratings, the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans would increase by approximately $800&nbsp;million at March&nbsp;31, 2003. Thissensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Thepurpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact risk ratingshave on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for commercial loans. Itis not intended to imply management's expectation of future deterioration inrisk ratings. Given the process the Firm follows in determining risk ratings ofits loans, management believes the current risk ratings assigned to commercialloans are appropriate and the likelihood of a one-notch downgrade for allcommercial loans is remote.Trading and Available-for-Sale portfoliosThe following table summarizes the Firm's trading and available-for-saleportfolios by valuation methodology at March&nbsp;31, 2003:NONEXCHANGE TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUEIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase uses nonexchange tradedcommodity contracts. To determine fair value, the Firm uses various fair valueestimation techniques, which are primarily based on internal models withsignificant observable market parameters. The Firm's nonexchange tradedcommodity contracts are primarily energy-related contracts. The following tablesummarizes the changes in fair value for nonexchange traded commodity contractsfor the first quarter of 2003:58 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following table indicates the schedule of maturities of nonexchange tradedcommodity contracts at March&nbsp;31, 2003:ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTSConsolidation of variable interest entitiesIn January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46. Entities that would be assessed forconsolidation under FIN 46 are typically referred to as Special-PurposeEntities (&#147;SPEs&#148;), although other non-SPE-type entities may also be subject tothe guidance. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated bya company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from thevariable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of theentity's residual returns, or both. The provisions are effective for any newentities that are originated subsequent to January&nbsp;31, 2003. For entities thatwere originated prior to February&nbsp;1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 areeffective July&nbsp;1, 2003.Based upon its current interpretation, the Firm believes thatthe effect of applying FIN&nbsp;46 to entities originated prior toFebruary&nbsp;1, 2003, could be an increase of up to $25&nbsp;billionin the Firm's assets and liabilities, assuming no restructuringof existing vehicles. The increase primarily relates tomulti-seller conduits; CDOs and similar vehicles for which the Firm or itsaffiliates act as the asset manager; and other entities in which the Firm's tradingfunctions have interests that absorb a majority of the expected loss. Forfurther details, see Note 8. The Firm continues to assess restructuringalternatives associated with multi-seller conduits. In addition, due to thecomplexity of the new guidance and evolving interpretation among accountingprofessionals, the Firm continues to assess the accounting and disclosureimpact of FIN 46 on all of its relationships with variable interest entities.Accounting for trading derivativesIn October 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force concluded on Issue 02&#150;03,which, effective January&nbsp;1, 2003, precludes mark-to-market accounting forenergy-related contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative underSFAS 133 (i.e., transportation, storage, or capacity contracts). The Firmimplemented this provision of EITF 02-03; its effect was immaterial to theFirm's Consolidated Statement of Income. In November 2002, as part of thediscussion of Issue 02&#150;03, the FASB staff further confirmed their view that anentity should not recognize profit at the inception of a trade involving aderivative financial instrument in the absence of: (a)&nbsp;quoted market prices inan active market, (b)&nbsp;observable prices of other current market transactions or(c)&nbsp;other observable data supporting a valuation technique. The FASB intends in2003 to continue its focus on issues relating to the fair value of financialinstruments.Derivative instruments and hedgingactivitiesIn April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS&nbsp;149, whichamends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, includingcertain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and forhedging activities under SFAS&nbsp;133. Specifically, SFAS&nbsp;149clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial netinvestment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when aderivative contains a financing component that warrants specialreporting in the statement of cash flows. This Statement is generallyeffective for contracts entered into or modified after June&nbsp;30,2003 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Firm'sConsolidated Financial Statements.59 Table of ContentsPart IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

JPMorgan Chase is involved in a number of lawsuits andinvestigations arising out of its banking relationships with Enron Corp. andits subsidiaries (&#147;Enron&#148;). On January&nbsp;2, 2003, the Firm settled its disputewith 11 insurance companies that had issued surety bonds guaranteeingobligations of Enron Corp., and received from the insurance companies $502million in cash and $75&nbsp;million of unsecured claims. Still pending in London isa lawsuit by the Firm against Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale seeking tocompel payment of $165&nbsp;million under an Enron-related letter of credit issuedby the bank.Actions involving Enron have also been initiated by other parties againstJPMorgan Chase and its directors and certain of its officers. These lawsuitsinclude a series of purported class actions brought on behalf of shareholdersof Enron, including the lead action captioned Newby v. Enron Corp., and aseries of purported class actions brought on behalf of Enron employees whoparticipated in various employee stock ownership plans, including the leadaction captioned Tittle v. Enron Corp., both of which are pending in U.S.District Court in Houston. The consolidated complaint filed in Newby named asdefendants, among others, JPMorgan Chase, several other investment bankingfirms, two law firms, Enron's former accountants and affiliated entities andindividuals and other individual defendants, including present and formerofficers and directors of Enron, and it purports to allege claims against JPMorganChase and the other defendants under federal and state securities laws.

Plaintiffs in these actions are individual and institutional investors,including state pension funds, who purchased debt securities issued by WorldCompursuant to public offerings in 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001. JPMSI acted as anunderwriter of the 1998, 2000 and 2001 offerings and was an initial purchaserin the December 2000 private bond offering. In addition to JPMSI, JPMorgan Chaseand, in one action, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. (&#147;JPMSL&#148;) in its capacity asone of the underwriters of the international tranche of the 2001 offering, thedefendants in various of the actions include other underwriters, certainexecutives of WorldCom and WorldCom's auditors. In the actions, plaintiffsallege that defendants either knew or were reckless or negligent in not knowingthat the securities were sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misrepresentationsand omissions of material facts concerning the financial condition of WorldCom.The complaints against JPMorgan Chase, JPMSI and JPMSL assert claims underfederal and state securities laws, other state statutes and under common lawtheories of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Commercial Financial Services litigation.

CFSI has commenced an action against JPMSI in Oklahoma state court andhas asserted claims against JPMSI for professional negligence and breach offiduciary duty. CFSI alleges that JPMSI failed to detect and prevent itsinsolvency. CFSI seeks unspecified damages.IPO allocation litigation. Beginning in May 2001, JPMorgan Chase and certain ofits securities subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous other firms inthe securities industry, as defendants in a large number of putative classaction lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of New York. These suits purport to challenge alleged improprieties inthe allocation of stock in various public offerings, including some offeringsfor which a JPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. The suits allegeviolations of securities and antitrust laws arising from alleged materialmisstatements and omissions in registration statements and prospectuses for theinitial public offerings and with respect to aftermarket transactions in theoffered securities. The securities claims allege, among other things,misrepresentations concerning commissions paid to JPMorgan Chase andaftermarket transactions by customers who received allocations of shares in therespective initial public offerings. The antitrust claims allege an illegalconspiracy to require customers, in exchange for initial public offeringallocations, to pay undisclosed and excessive commissions and to makeaftermarket purchases of the initial public offering securities at a pricehigher than the offering price as a precondition to receiving allocations. OnFebruary&nbsp;13, 2003, the Court denied the motions of JPMorgan Chase and others todismiss the securities complaints. JPMorgan Chase also has received varioussubpoenas and69 Table of ContentsPart IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)informal requests from governmental and other agencies seeking informationrelating to initial public offering allocation practices. On February&nbsp;20, 2003,the National Association of Securities Dealers (&#147;NASD&#148;) censured JPMSI andfined it $6&nbsp;million for activities it found to constitute unlawful profitsharing by Hambrecht & Quist Group prior to its acquisition in 2000. Inagreeing to the resolution of the charges, JPMSI neither admitted nor deniedthe NASD's contentions. JPMSI has been advised by the SEC that it is alsoconsidering bringing a disciplinary action against JPMSI. JPMSI has submittedto the staff of the SEC a letter outlining the basis for JPMSI's position thatno such action is warranted and is currently in discussions with the SEC.Research analysts' conflicts. On December&nbsp;20, 2002, the Firm reached anagreement in principle with the SEC, the NASD, the New York Stock Exchange, theNew York State Attorney General's Office, and the North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association, on behalf of state securities regulators, toresolve their investigations of JPMorgan Chase relating to research analystindependence. Pursuant to the agreement in principle, JPMorgan Chase willagree, among other things: (i)&nbsp;to pay $50&nbsp;million for retrospective relief, (ii)to adopt internal structural and operational reforms that will further augmentthe steps it has already taken to ensure the integrity of JPMorgan Chaseanalyst research, (iii)&nbsp;to contribute $25&nbsp;million spread over five years toprovide independent third-party research to clients and (iv)&nbsp;tocontribute $5&nbsp;million towards investor education. Mutually satisfactory settlement documentshave been negotiated and approved by the SEC, the NYSE, the NASD and the TexasState Securities Board. In due course, it is anticipated that mutuallysatisfactory settlement documents will be negotiated in the remaining states.They must be approved by the SEC and state regulatory authorities.Litigation reserve and other. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Firmestablished a reserve of $900&nbsp;million related to costs anticipated to beincurred in connection with the various private litigations and regulatoryinquiries involving Enron and the other material legal actions, proceedings andinvestigations discussed above. This reserve represents management's bestestimate, after consultation with counsel, of the current probable aggregatecosts associated with these matters. Of the $900&nbsp;million, $600&nbsp;million has beenallocated to the various cases, proceedings and investigations associated withEnron. The balance of $300&nbsp;million has been allocated to the variouslitigations, proceedings and investigations involving the Firm's debt andequity underwriting activities and equity research practices, and includes the$80&nbsp;million settlement in December 2002 relating to equity research practices.It is possible that the reserve could be subject to revision in the future. Asof March&nbsp;31, 2003, there have been no material charges against the reserve.In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations for which thereserve has been established, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named asdefendants in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedingsarising in connection with their respective businesses. Additional actions,investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters,particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages orwhere the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number ofparties, the Firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of thepending matters (including the pending matters as to which the reserve has beenestablished) will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of thesematters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pendingmatter may be. Subject to the foregoing caveat, JPMorgan Chase anticipates,based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel and aftertaking into account the establishment of the aforementioned $900&nbsp;millionreserve, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigationscurrently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on theconsolidated financial condition of the Firm, although the outcome of aparticular proceeding or the imposition of a particular fine or penalty may bematerial to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular perioddepending upon, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability and thelevel of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;2 Changes in Securities and Use of ProceedsDuring the first quarter of 2003, shares of common stock of J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. were issued in transactions exempt from registration under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof.
