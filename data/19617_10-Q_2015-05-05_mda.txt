>Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended March 31, 2015, and 2014.(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in other income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no significant ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three months ended March 31, 2015, and 2014.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, AFS securities, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&nbsp;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm's market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. 99Credit derivativesFor a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notes100The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings and maturity profile, and the total fair value, of credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, where JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.101Note 6 &#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note 7 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm's client-driven market-making activities.&#160;See Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.&nbsp;The following table presents the components of firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.Other incomeIncluded in other income is operating lease income of $469 million&#32;and $398 million&#32;for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014, respectively.102Note 7 &#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note 8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.103Note 8 &#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, see Note 9 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.7 billion&#32;and $3.7 billion, as of March 31, 2015, and $16.5 billion&#32;and $3.7 billion&#32;respectively, as of December 31, 2014. See Note 19 for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three months periods ended March 31, 2015, and 2014.&nbsp;The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2015&#32;at this time. For 2015, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $33 million. The 2015&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $47 million&#32;and $2 million, respectively.104Note 9 &#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.In the first quarter of 2015, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2014 performance year, the Firm granted 34 million&#32;RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $55.91&#32;per RSU.&nbsp;Note 10 &#8211; Noninterest expenseThe following table presents the components of noninterest expense.105Note 11 &#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as trading, AFS or held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;). Securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 3. Predominantly all of the Firm's AFS and HTM investment securities (the &#8220;investment securities portfolio&#8221;) are held by the Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At March 31, 2015, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+&#32;(based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.&nbsp;Securities gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.106Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.107Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally decreased since December 31, 2014. The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of March 31, 2015, the Firm does not intend to sell any securities with a loss position in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities reported in the table above, for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2015.108Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March 31, 2015, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.109Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected, see Note 4. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22. &nbsp;Certain prior period amounts for both securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed; and securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. These revisions had no impact on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets or its results of operations.The following table presents as of March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the gross and net securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated balance sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities borrowed are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.The following table presents information as of March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, regarding the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement.&#160;The table below excludes information related to resale agreements and securities borrowed where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.110The following table presents as of March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned. Securities sold under repurchase agreements have been presented on the Consolidated balance sheets net of securities purchased under resale agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities sold under repurchase agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities loaned are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.The following table presents information as of March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, regarding the securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement.&#160;The table below excludes information related to repurchase agreements and securities loaned where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt both March 31, 2015&#32;and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm held $13.8 billion&#32;of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. &nbsp;The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in other borrowed funds on theConsolidated balance sheets.111Note 13 &#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report. See Note 4 of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:112The following tables summarize the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.The following table provides information about gains and losses, including lower of cost or fair value adjustments, on loan sales by portfolio segment.113Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.114Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.115The following tables represent the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options &nbsp;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm's delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.116The following table present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Loan modificationsThe Firm is required to provide borrower relief under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This borrower relief includes reductions of principal and forbearance.Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;The following table presents new TDRs reported by the Firm.Nature and extent of modificationsMaking Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;), as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.117Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the Firm's loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.At March&#160;31, 2015, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6&#32;years for senior lien home equity, 8&#32;years for junior lien home equity, 9&#32;years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8&#32;years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $1.4 billion&#32;and $1.5 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.118Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.119Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;Loan modificationsCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the table above.&#160;See Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report for further information on other consumer loans modified in TDRs.The following table provides information about the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. New TDRs were not material as of March&#160;31, 2015 and 2014.120Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.121Approximately 20%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014, and represents the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option adjustable-rate mortgage (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $2.9 billion&#32;and $3.2 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.122Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's credit card loans.Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;At March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, $139 million&#32;and $159 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $86 million&#32;and $95 million&#32;at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60&#32;months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs.&#160;New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the three months ended March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014, were $178 million&#32;and $233 million, respectively. For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate for credit card loans modified was expected to be 27.34%and 27.91%&#32;as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively.123Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note 14 and Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.124Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans are comprised of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.&nbsp;Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. TDRs were not material as of March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014.125Note 14 &#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.126Note 15 &#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;), see Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 130 of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm's primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 131&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including student loans) primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm's involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.127The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans; holding senior interests or subordinated interests; recourse or guarantee arrangements; and derivative transactions. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. See Securitization activity on page 132&#32;of this Note for further information regarding the Firm's cash flows with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and page 132&#32;of this Note for information on the Firm's loan sales to U.S. government agencies.128Residential mortgagesFor a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with residential mortgage securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.At March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm did not consolidate the assets of certain Firm-sponsored residential mortgage securitization VIEs, in which the Firm had continuing involvement, primarily due to the fact that the Firm did not hold an interest in these trusts that could potentially be significant to the trusts. See the table on page 131&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizationsCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. For a more detailed description of the Firm's involvement with commercial mortgage and other consumer securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report. See the table on page 131&#32;of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for more information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.Re-securitizationsFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase'sparticipation in re-securitization transactions, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.During the three months ended March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014, the Firm transferred $3.9 billion&#32;and $5.3 billion&#32;respectively of securities to agency VIEs, and $472 million&#32;and $169 million, respectively, of securities to private-label VIEs.As of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm did not consolidate any agency re-securitizations. As of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm consolidated $73 million&#32;and $77 million, respectively, of assets, and $19 million&#32;and $21 million, respectively, of liabilities of private-label re-securitizations. See the table on page 131&#32;of this Note for more information on consolidated re-securitization transactions.&nbsp;As of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, total assets (including the notional amount of interest-only securities) of nonconsolidated Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization entities in which the Firm has continuing involvement were $2.3 billion&#32;and $2.9 billion, respectively. At March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm held approximately $1.6 billion&#32;and $2.4 billion, respectively, of interests in nonconsolidated agency re-securitization entities, and $14 million&#32;and $36 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated interests in nonconsolidated private-label re-securitization entities.

The Firm held $4.9 billion&#32;and $5.7 billion&#32;of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, which was eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. The Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm to the multi-seller conduits have been eliminated in consolidation. Unfunded lending-related commitments made to clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits were $10.2 billion&#32;and $9.9 billion&#32;at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. For more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments, see Note 21.VIEs associated with investor intermediation activitiesMunicipal bond vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with municipal bond vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.129The Firm's exposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, including the ratings profile of the VIEs' assets, was as follows.Credit-related note and asset swap vehiclesFor a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chase's principal involvement with credit-related note and asset swap vehicles, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.&nbsp;VIEs sponsored by third partiesThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs sponsored by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm's-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets similarly to the way it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.130Consolidated VIE assets and liabilitiesThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.Loan securitizationsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, student and commercial (primarily related to real estate) loans. For a &nbsp;further description of the Firm's accounting policies regarding securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.131Securitization activityThe following table provides information related to the Firm's securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, related to assets held in JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved based on the accounting rules in effect at the time of the securitization.Freddie Mac.Loans and excess MSRs sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entitiesIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the &#8220;GSEs&#8221;). These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying any of the transactions described above as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. See Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report for additional information about the Firm's loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications. See Note 16 for additional information about the impact of the Firm's sale of certain excess MSRs.&nbsp;The following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the GSEs, loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines, and other third-party-sponsored securitization entities.132Options to repurchase delinquent loansIn addition to the Firm's obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 21, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm's repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding &nbsp;liability. As of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, the Firm had recorded on its Consolidated balance sheets $12.3 billion&#32;and $12.4 billion, respectively, of loans that either had been repurchased or for which the Firm had an option to repurchase. Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools. Additionally, real estate owned resulting from voluntary repurchases of loans was $471 million&#32;and $464&#160;million&#32;as of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively. Substantially all of these loans and real estate owned are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. For additional information, refer to Note 13 of this Form 10-Q and Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Loan delinquencies and liquidation lossesThe table below includes information about components of nonconsolidated securitized financial assets, in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and delinquencies as of March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, respectively; and liquidation losses for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.133Note 16 &#8211; Goodwill and other intangible assetsFor a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.&nbsp;Impairment testingFor further description of the Firm's goodwill impairment testing process, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units, and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test, see Impairment testing on pages 271&#8211;272 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.Goodwill was not impaired at March&#160;31, 2015, or December&#160;31, 2014, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2015.However, the Firm's Mortgage Banking business in CCB remains at an elevated risk of goodwill impairment due to its exposure to U.S. economic conditions, such as increases in primary mortgage interest rates, lower mortgage origination volume, higher costs to resolve foreclosure-related matters or from deterioration in economic conditions, including decreases in home prices that result in increased credit losses.Declines in business performance, increases in equity capital requirements, or increases in the estimated cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.134Mortgage servicing rightsMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. For a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report&#32;and Note 3 of this Form 10-Q.The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014.135The following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three months ended&#32;March 31, 2015&#32;and 2014.The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm's MSRs at March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.CPR: Constant prepayment rate.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on variation in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.Other intangible assetsFor information regarding other intangible assets, see Note 17 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.136Note 17 &#8211; DepositsFor further discussion on deposits, see Note 19 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.At March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.&nbsp;Note 18 &#8211; Earnings per shareFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#8220;EPS&#8221;), see Note 24 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report. The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended&#32;March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and 2014.137Note 19 &#8211; Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)AOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), cash flow hedging activities, and net loss and prior service costs/(credit) related to the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.The following table presents the pretax and after-tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income/(loss). 138Note 20 &#8211; Regulatory capitalThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the Firm's national banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase&#160;Bank&#160;USA,&#160;N.A.Basel III, for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its insured depository institution (&#8220;IDI&#8221;) subsidiaries, revised, among other things, the definition of capital and introduced a new common equity Tier 1 capital (&#8220;CET1 capital&#8221;) requirement; presents two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), a general (Standardized) approach, which replaced Basel I RWA effective January 1, 2015, (&#8220;Basel III Standardized&#8221;) and an advanced approach, which replaced Basel II RWA (&#8220;Basel III Advanced&#8221;); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. Certain of the requirements of Basel III are subject to phase-in periods that began on January 1, 2014 and continue through the end of 2018 (&#8220;Basel III Transitional&#8221;).There are three categories of risk-based capital under the Basel III Transitional rules: Common equity Tier 1 capital (&#8220;CET1 capital&#8221;), as well as Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital predominantly includes common stockholders' equity (including capital for AOCI related to debt and equity securities classified as AFS as well as for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans), less certain deductions for goodwill, MSRs and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) and tax credit carryforwards. Tier 1 capital is predominantly comprised of CET1 capital as well as perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Total capital is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. The capital adequacy of the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries is evaluated against the Basel III approach (Standardized or Advanced) which results in the lower ratio (the &#8220;Collins Floor&#8221;), as required by the Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act.&nbsp;The following tables present the regulatory capital, assets and risk-based capital ratios for JPMorgan Chase and its significant national bank subsidiaries under both Basel III Standardized Transitional and Basel III Advanced Transitional.139&nbsp;Under the risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios of CET1 (beginning January 1, 2015), Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum leverage ratio (which is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average assets). Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. National bank subsidiaries also are subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators. The following table presents the minimum ratios to which the Firm and its national bank subsidiaries are subject as of March&#160;31, 2015.As of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, JPMorgan Chase and all of its banking subsidiaries were well-capitalized and met all capital requirements to which each was subject.140Note 21 &#8211; Off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitmentsJPMorgan Chase&#32;provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to meet the financing needs of its customers. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the counterparty draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the counterparty subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its actual future credit exposure or funding requirements. For further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm's related accounting policies, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;To provide for probable credit losses inherent in consumer (excluding credit card) and wholesale lending commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days&#32;or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close home equity lines of credit when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.141142Other unfunded commitments to extend creditOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally comprise commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.Also included in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to noninvestment-grade counterparties in connection with leveraged finance activities, which were $29.5 billion&#32;and $23.4 billion&#32;at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively. For further information, see Note 3 and Note 4.The Firm acts as a settlement and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. In its role as settlement and custody bank, the Firm is exposed to the intra-day credit risk of its cash borrower clients, usually broker-dealers. This exposure arises under secured clearance advance facilities that the Firm extends to its clients (i.e. cash borrowers); these facilities contractually limit the Firm's intra-day credit risk to the facility amountand must be repaid by the end of the day. As of March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and December&#160;31, 2014, the secured clearance advance facility maximum outstanding commitment amount was $11.9 billion&#32;and $12.6 billion, respectively.&nbsp;GuaranteesThe Firm considers the following off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For a further discussion of the off&#8211;balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report. The recorded amounts of the liabilities related to guarantees and indemnifications at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, excluding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, are discussed below.Standby letters of credit and other financial guaranteesStandby letters of credit (&#8220;SBLC&#8221;) and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions. The carrying values of standby and other letters of credit were $770 million&#32;and $789 million&#32;at March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, which were classified in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets; these carrying values included $231 million&#32;and $235 million, respectively, for the allowance for lending-related commitments, and $539 million&#32;and $554 million, respectively, for the guarantee liability and corresponding asset.The following table summarizes the types of facilities under which standby letters of credit and other letters of credit arrangements are outstanding by the ratings profiles of the Firm's customers, as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014.Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of creditDerivatives qualifying as guaranteesIn addition to the contracts described above, the Firm transacts certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. For further information on these derivatives, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report. The total notional value of the derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $52.6 billion&#32;and $53.6 billion&#32;at March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively. The notional amount generally represents the Firm's maximum exposure to derivatives qualifying as guarantees. However, exposure to &nbsp;certain stable value contracts is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount; the notional amount on these stable value contracts was $27.6 billion&#32;and $27.5 billion&#32;at March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $2.9 billion&#32;at both March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014. The fair values of the contracts reflect the probability of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value related to derivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees were derivative payables of $67 million&#32;and $102 million&#32;and 143derivative receivables of $22 million&#32;at both March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. For a further discussion of credit derivatives, see Note 5.Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnificationsMortgage repurchase liabilityIn connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with the GSEs, as described in Note 15 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report, the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements. The Firm has been, and may be, required to repurchase loans and/or indemnify the GSEs (e.g., with &#8220;make-whole&#8221; payments to reimburse the GSEs for their realized losses on liquidated loans). To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that the Firm purchased from third parties that remain viable, the Firm typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expense.For additional information, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.The following table summarizes the change in the mortgage repurchase liability for each of the periods presented.Private label securitizationsThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.For additional information regarding litigation, see Note 23 of this Form 10-Q&#32;and Note 31 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Loans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm's securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled $5.6 billion&#32;and $6.1 billion, respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded, which is representative of the Firm's view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was $99 million&#32;and $102 million&#32;at March 31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, respectively.144Note 22 &#8211; Pledged assets and collateralFor a discussion of the Firm's pledged assets and collateral, see Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.Pledged assetsThe Firm may pledge financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity with central banks and for other purposes, including to secure borrowings and public deposits, and to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged by the secured parties and are identified as financial assets owned (pledged to various parties) on the Consolidated balance sheets. At March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had pledged assets of $342.8 billion&#32;and $324.5 billion, respectively, at Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks (&#8220;FHLBs&#8221;). In addition, as of March&#160;31, 2015, and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had pledged $51.6 billion&#32;and $60.1 billion, respectively, of financial assets that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. Total assets pledged do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. See Note 15 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. For additional information on the Firm's securities financing activities, see Note 12. For additional information on the Firm's long-term debt, see Note 21 of JPMorgan Chase's 2014 Annual Report.CollateralAt March&#160;31, 2015&#32;and December&#160;31, 2014, the Firm had accepted financial assets as collateral that it could sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use with a fair value of approximately $779.3 billion&#32;and $761.7 billion, respectively. This collateral was generally obtained under resale agreements, securities borrowing agreements, customer margin loans and derivative agreements. Of the collateral received, approximately $609.3 billion&#32;and $596.8 billion, respectively, were sold or repledged, generally as collateral under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales and to collateralize deposits and derivative agreements. &nbsp;Note 23 &#8211; LitigationContingenciesAs of March&#160;31, 2015, the Firm and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0&#32;to approximately $5.5 billion&#32;at March 31, 2015. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain cases, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made. Moreover, the Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are in preliminary stages), the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Firm) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, particularly proceedings that could result from government investigations. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary.Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.Auto Dealer Regulatory Matter.&#160;The Firm is engaged in discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) about potential statistical disparities in markups charged to different races and ethnicities by automobile dealers on loans originated by those dealers and purchased by the Firm.CIO Litigation. The Firm has been sued in a consolidated shareholder putative class action, a consolidated putative class action brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) and seven&#32;shareholder derivative actions brought in Delaware state court and in New York federal and state courts relating to 2012 losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by the Firm's Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;). Four&#32;of the shareholder derivative actions have been dismissed, and plaintiffs in three&#32;of those actions have appealed those dismissals. 145Motions to dismiss have also been filed in two&#32;other shareholder derivative actions. Credit Default Swaps Investigations and Litigation. In July 2013, the European Commission (the &#8220;EC&#8221;) filed a Statement of Objections against the Firm (including various subsidiaries) and other industry members in connection with its ongoing investigation into the credit default swaps (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) marketplace. The EC asserts that between 2006 and 2009, a number of investment banks acted collectively through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) and Markit Group Limited (&#8220;Markit&#8221;) to foreclose exchanges from the potential market for exchange-traded credit derivatives. The Firm submitted a response to the Statement of Objections in January 2014, and the EC held a hearing in May 2014. DOJ also has an ongoing investigation into the CDS marketplace, which was initiated in July 2009.Separately, the Firm and other industry members are defendants in a consolidated putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers and sellers of CDS. The complaint refers to the ongoing investigations by the EC and DOJ into the CDS market, and alleges that the defendant investment banks and dealers, including the Firm, as well as Markit and/or ISDA, collectively prevented new entrants into the market for exchange-traded CDS products. Defendants moved to dismiss this action, and in September 2014, the Court granted defendants' motion in part, dismissing claims for damages based on transactions effected before the Autumn of 2008, as well as certain other claims.Custody Assets Investigation. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") is conducting an investigation concerning compliance by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London branch and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited with the FCA's rules regarding the provision of custody services relating to the administration of client assets. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London branch and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited are responding to and cooperating with the investigation.Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (&#8220;FX&#8221;) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX-related investigations by other government authorities remain ongoing, including a criminal investigation by DOJ and a civil investigation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), among others. The Firm's discussions with DOJ regarding resolution of potential charges are in advanced stages. The Firm's discussions with the Federal Reserve regarding resolution of its investigation are also in advanced stages. &#32;Since November 2013, a number of class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against a number of foreign exchange dealers, including the Firm, for alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and unjust enrichment based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates reported on the WM/Reuters service. In March 2014, &nbsp;plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended U.S. class action complaint; two&#32;other class actions were brought by non-U.S.-based plaintiffs. The Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the U.S. class action and granted the motion to dismiss the two&#32;non-U.S. class actions. In January 2015, the Firm settled the U.S. class action, and this settlement is subject to court approval. In early 2015, two&#32;additional class actions were filed seeking damages for persons who transacted FX futures and options on futures. General Motors Litigation.&#160;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. participated in, and was the Administrative&#160;Agent on behalf of a syndicate of lenders on, a $1.5 billion&#32;syndicated Term Loan facility (&#8220;Term Loan&#8221;) for General Motors Corporation (&#8220;GM&#8221;).&#160;In July 2009, in connection with the GM bankruptcy proceedings, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Motors Liquidation Company (&#8220;Creditors Committee&#8221;) filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for other lenders on the Term Loan, seeking to hold the underlying lien invalid based on the filing of a UCC-3 termination statement relating to the Term Loan. In March 2013, the Bankruptcy Court granted JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the Creditors Committee's complaint on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not authorize the filing of the UCC-3 termination statement at issue.&#160;The Creditors Committee appealed the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of its claim to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed the Bankruptcy Court's dismissal of the Creditors Committee's claim and remanded the case to the Bankruptcy Court with instructions to enter partial summary judgment for the Creditors Committee as to the termination statement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. then filed a petition requesting that the full Court of Appeals rehear the case en banc. In April 2015, the Court of Appeals issued an order denying the petition for rehearing en banc. Continued proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court are anticipated with respect to, among other things, additional defenses asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the value of additional collateral on the Term Loan, which was not the subject of the termination statement.Interchange Litigation. A group of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and MasterCard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees, enacted respective rules in violation of antitrust laws, and engaged in tying/bundling and exclusive dealing. The parties have entered into an agreement to settle the cases for a cash payment of $6.1 billion&#32;to the class plaintiffs (of which the Firm's share is approximately 20%) and an amount equal to ten&#32;basis points of credit card interchange for a period of eight&#32;months to be measured from a date within 60 days&#32;of the end of the opt-out period. The agreement also provides for modifications to each credit card network's rules, including those that prohibit surcharging credit card transactions. In December 2013, the Court issued a decision granting final approval of the settlement. A number of merchants have appealed. 146Certain merchants that opted out of the class settlement have filed actions against Visa and MasterCard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. Defendants' motion to dismiss the actions was denied in July 2014.Investment Management Litigation. The Firm is defending two&#32;pending cases that allege that investment portfolios managed by J.P. Morgan Investment Management (&#8220;JPMIM&#8221;) were inappropriately invested in securities backed by residential real estate collateral. Plaintiffs Assured Guaranty (U.K.) and Ambac Assurance UK Limited claim that JPMIM is liable for losses of more than $1 billion&#32;in market value of these securities. Discovery is proceeding.Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy Proceedings. In May 2010, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (&#8220;LBHI&#8221;) and its Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) filed a complaint (and later an amended complaint) against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York that asserts both federal bankruptcy law and state common law claims, and seeks, among other relief, to recover $7.9 billion&#32;in collateral that was transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the weeks preceding LBHI's bankruptcy. The amended complaint also seeks unspecified damages on the grounds that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s collateral requests hastened LBHI's bankruptcy. The Court dismissed the counts of the amended complaint that sought to void the allegedly constructively fraudulent and preferential transfers made to the Firm during the months of August and September 2008. The Firm has filed counterclaims against LBHI alleging that LBHI fraudulently induced the Firm to make large extensions of credit against inappropriate collateral in connection with the Firm's role as the clearing bank for Lehman Brothers Inc. (&#8220;LBI&#8221;), LBHI's broker-dealer subsidiary. These extensions of credit left the Firm with more than $25 billion&#32;in claims against the estate of LBI. The case has been transferred from the Bankruptcy Court to the District Court, and the Firm has moved for summary judgment seeking the dismissal of all of LBHI's claims.&#160;LBHI has also moved for summary judgment on certain of its claims and seeking the dismissal of the Firm's counterclaims.In the Bankruptcy Court proceedings, LBHI and several of its subsidiaries that had been Chapter 11 debtors have filed a separate complaint and objection to derivatives claims asserted by the Firm alleging that the amount of the derivatives claims had been overstated and challenging certain set-offs taken by JPMorgan Chase entities to recover on the claims. The Firm responded to this separate complaint and objection in February 2013. LBHI and the Committee have also filed an objection to the claims asserted by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. against LBHI with respect to clearing advances made to LBI, principally on the grounds that the Firm had not conducted the sale of the securities collateral held for its claims in a commercially reasonable manner. Discovery regarding both objections is ongoing. In January 2015, LBHI filed additional objections relating to a variety of claims that the Firm had filed in the Bankruptcy Court proceedings. The bankruptcy claims and other claims of the Firm against Lehman entities have been &nbsp;paid in full, subject to potential adjustment depending on the outcome of the objections filed by LBHI and the Committee.LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has received subpoenas and requests for documents and, in some cases, interviews, from federal and state agencies and entities, including DOJ, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and various state attorneys general, as well as the EC, the FCA, the Canadian Competition Bureau, the Swiss Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities and banking associations around the world relating primarily to the process by which interest rates were submitted to the British Bankers Association (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the BBA's London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) for various currencies, principally in 2007 and 2008. Some of the inquiries also relate to similar processes by which information on rates is submitted to the European Banking Federation (&#8220;EBF&#8221;) in connection with the setting of the EBF's Euro Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;EURIBOR&#8221;) and to the Japanese Bankers' Association for the setting of Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (&#8220;TIBOR&#8221;) as well as to other processes for the setting of other reference rates in various parts of the world during similar time periods. The Firm is responding to and continuing to cooperate with these inquiries. In December 2013, JPMorgan Chase reached a settlement with the EC regarding its Japanese Yen LIBOR investigation and agreed to pay a fine of &#8364;80 million. In January 2014, the Canadian Competition Bureau announced that it has discontinued its investigation related to Yen LIBOR. In May 2014, the EC issued a Statement of Objections outlining its case against the Firm (and others) as to EURIBOR, to which the Firm has filed a response. In October 2014, JPMorgan Chase reached a settlement with the EC regarding the EC's Swiss franc LIBOR investigation and agreed to pay a fine of &#8364;72 million. In January 2015, the FCA informed JPMorgan Chase that it has discontinued its investigation of the Firm concerning LIBOR and EURIBOR.In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and class actions filed in various United States District Courts, in which plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated the U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR and/or EURIBOR rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in U.S. dollar LIBOR, Yen LIBOR, Swiss franc LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR or EURIBOR and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages.The U.S. dollar LIBOR-related putative class actions and most U.S. dollar LIBOR-related individual actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (&#8220;Multi-District Litigation&#8221;). In March 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss 147the claims in the three&#32;lead putative class actions, dismissing with prejudice the antitrust claims, and permitting certain claims under the Commodity Exchange Act and common law. In September 2013, class plaintiffs in two&#32;of the three&#32;lead putative class actions filed amended complaints, which defendants moved to dismiss. In June 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motions to dismiss, further limiting the subset of Commodity Exchange Act and common law claims that may proceed. Plaintiffs in the third putative class action appealed the dismissal of the antitrust claims, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In January 2015, the United States Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals, holding that plaintiffs have the jurisdictional right to appeal, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.&#160;Motions to dismiss are pending in the remaining individual actions and three additional putative class actions. A new putative class action, which overlaps with one of the lead actions, was filed in February 2015 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.The Firm is one of the defendants in a putative class action alleging manipulation of Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of plaintiffs who purchased or sold exchange-traded Euroyen futures and options contracts. In March 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss, including dismissal of plaintiff's antitrust and unjust enrichment claims. The Firm is one of the defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the interest rate benchmark EURIBOR. The case is currently stayed.The Firm is also a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to the interest rate benchmark Swiss franc LIBOR. The Firm is also one of the defendants in a number of putative class actions alleging that defendant banks and ICAP conspired to manipulate the U.S. dollar ISDAFIX rates. Plaintiffs primarily assert claims under the federal antitrust laws and Commodities Exchange Act.&#160;In February 2015, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint, which defendants have moved to dismiss.Madoff Litigation. Various subsidiaries of the Firm, including J.P. Morgan Securities plc, have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed in Bankruptcy Court in New York arising out of the liquidation proceedings of Fairfield Sentry Limited and Fairfield Sigma Limited, so-called Madoff feeder funds. These actions seek to recover payments made by the funds to defendants totaling approximately $155 million. All but two&#32;of these actions have been dismissed.In addition, a putative class action was brought by investors in certain feeder funds against JPMorgan Chase in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New &nbsp;York, as was a motion by separate potential class plaintiffs to add claims against the Firm and certain subsidiaries to an already pending putative class action in the same court. The allegations in these complaints largely track those previously raised by the court-appointed trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. The District Court dismissed these complaints and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. The United States Supreme Court denied plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari in March 2015.The Firm is a defendant in five&#32;other Madoff-related individual investor actions pending in New York state court. The allegations in all of these actions are essentially identical, and involve claims against the Firm for, among other things, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust enrichment. In August 2014, the Court dismissed all claims against the Firm. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.A putative class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey by investors who were net winners (i.e., Madoff customers who had taken more money out of their accounts than had been invested) in Madoff's Ponzi scheme and were not included in the previous class action settlement. These plaintiffs allege violations of the federal securities law, federal and state racketeering statutes and multiple common law and statutory claims including breach of trust, aiding and abetting embezzlement, unjust enrichment, conversion and commercial bad faith. A similar action has been filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, although it is not styled as a class action, and includes a claim pursuant to a Florida statute. The Firm has moved to transfer these cases to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Florida court denied the motion in January 2015. In March 2015, the New Jersey court granted the motion, and plaintiffs' appeal of that decision is pending.Three&#32;shareholder derivative actions have also been filed in New York federal and state court against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former Board members, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the Firm's relationship with Bernard Madoff and the alleged failure to maintain effective internal controls to detect fraudulent transactions. The actions seek declaratory relief and damages.&#160;In July 2014, the federal court granted defendants' motions to dismiss two&#32;of the actions. One plaintiff chose not to appeal and the other filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied in November 2014. The latter plaintiff has filed an appeal. In the remaining state court action, a hearing on defendants' motion to dismiss was held in October 2014, and the court reserved decision.MF Global. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC has been named as one&#32;of several defendants in a number of putative class actions filed by purchasers of MF Global's publicly traded securities asserting violations of federal securities laws and alleging that the offering documents contained materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding MF Global. These actions have been settled, subject to final 148approval by the court. The Firm also has responded to inquiries from the CFTC relating to the Firm's banking and other business relationships with MF Global, including as a depository for MF Global's customer segregated accounts.Mortgage-Backed Securities and Repurchase Litigation and Related Regulatory Investigations. JPMorgan Chase and affiliates (together, &#8220;JPMC&#8221;), Bear Stearns and affiliates (together, &#8220;Bear Stearns&#8221;) and certain Washington Mutual affiliates (together, &#8220;Washington Mutual&#8221;) have been named as defendants in a number of cases in their various roles in offerings of mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;). These cases include class action suits on behalf of MBS purchasers, actions by individual MBS purchasers and actions by monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of principal and interest for particular tranches of MBS offerings. Following the settlements referred to under &#8220;Repurchase Litigation&#8221; and &#8220;Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation&#8221; below, there are currently pending and tolled investor and monoline insurer claims involving MBS with an original principal balance of approximately $26.8 billion, of which $24.3 billion&#32;involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual as issuer and $2.5 billion&#32;involves JPMC, Bear Stearns or Washington Mutual solely as underwriter. The Firm and certain of its current and former officers and Board members have also been sued in shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm's MBS activities, and trustees have asserted or have threatened to assert claims that loans in securitization trusts should be repurchased.Issuer Litigation &#8211; Class Actions.&#32;In February 2015, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a settlement of a class action against JPMC and Bear Stearns as MBS underwriters. Two&#32;class actions remain pending against JPMC and Bear Stearns as MBS issuers. In the action concerning JPMC, plaintiffs' motion for class certification has been granted with respect to liability but denied without prejudice as to damages. In the action concerning Bear Stearns, the court has preliminarily approved a settlement and a final court approval hearing is scheduled for May 2015. The Firm is also defending a putative class action brought against Bear Stearns in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The parties have agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve that action.Issuer Litigation &#8211; Individual Purchaser Actions.&#32;In addition to class actions, the Firm is defending individual actions brought against JPMC, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual as MBS issuers (and, in some cases, also as underwriters of their own MBS offerings). These actions are pending in federal and state courts across the U.S. and are in various stages of litigation.Monoline Insurer Litigation.&#32;The Firm is defending two&#32;pending actions relating to the same monoline insurer's guarantees of principal and interest on certain classes of 11&#32;different Bear Stearns MBS offerings. These actions are pending in state court in New York and are in various stages of litigation.&nbsp;Underwriter Actions.&#32;In actions against the Firm involving offerings where the Firm was solely an underwriter of other issuers' MBS offerings, the Firm has contractual rights to indemnification from the issuers. However, those indemnity rights may prove effectively unenforceable in various situations, such as where the issuers are now defunct. There are currently actions of this type pending against the Firm in federal and state courts in various stages of litigation. Repurchase Litigation.&#32;The Firm is defending a number of actions brought by trustees, securities administrators or master servicers of various MBS trusts and others on behalf of purchasers of securities issued by those trusts. These cases generally allege breaches of various representations and warranties regarding securitized loans and seek repurchase of those loans or equivalent monetary relief, as well as indemnification of attorneys' fees and costs and other remedies. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, acting as trustee for various MBS trusts, has filed such a suit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) in connection with a significant number of MBS issued by Washington Mutual; that case is described in the Washington Mutual Litigations section below. Other repurchase actions, each specific to one or more MBS transactions issued by JPMC and/or Bear Stearns, are in various stages of litigation.In addition, the Firm and a group of 21&#32;institutional MBS investors made a binding offer to the trustees of MBS issued by JPMC and Bear Stearns providing for the payment of $4.5 billion&#32;and the implementation of certain servicing changes by JPMC, to resolve all repurchase and servicing claims that have been asserted or could have been asserted with respect to the 330&#32;MBS trusts issued between 2005 and 2008. The offer does not resolve claims relating to Washington Mutual MBS. The seven&#32;trustees (or separate and successor trustees) for this group of 330&#32;trusts have accepted the settlement for 319&#32;trusts in whole or in part and excluded from the settlement 16&#32;trusts in whole or in part. The trustees' acceptance is subject to a judicial approval proceeding initiated by the trustees and pending in New York state court. Certain investors in some of the trusts for which the settlement has been accepted have intervened in the judicial approval proceeding, challenging the trustees' acceptance of the settlement.Additional actions have been filed against third-party trustees that relate to loan repurchase and servicing claims involving trusts that the Firm sponsored.Derivative Actions.&#32;Shareholder derivative actions relating to the Firm's MBS activities have been filed against the Firm, as nominal defendant, and certain of its current and former officers and members of its Board of Directors, in New York state court and California federal court. Two&#32;of the New York actions have been dismissed and one is on appeal. A consolidated action in California federal court has been dismissed without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction and plaintiffs are pursuing discovery.Government Enforcement Investigations and Litigation.&#32;The Firm is responding to an ongoing investigation being 149conducted by the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California relating to MBS offerings securitized and sold by the Firm and its subsidiaries. The Firm has also received subpoenas and informal requests for information from state authorities concerning the issuance and underwriting of MBS-related matters. The Firm continues to respond to these MBS-related regulatory inquiries.In addition, the Firm continues to cooperate with investigations by DOJ, including the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut, the SEC Division of Enforcement and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, all of which relate to, among other matters, communications with counterparties in connection with certain secondary market trading in residential and commercial MBS.The Firm has entered into agreements with a number of entities that purchased MBS that toll applicable limitations periods with respect to their claims, and has settled, and in the future may settle, tolled claims. There is no assurance that the Firm will not be named as a defendant in additional MBS-related litigation.Mortgage-Related Investigations and Litigation. The Attorney General of Massachusetts filed an action against the Firm, other servicers and a mortgage recording company, asserting claims for various alleged wrongdoings relating to mortgage assignments and use of the industry's electronic mortgage registry. In January 2015, the Firm entered into a settlement resolving this action.The Firm entered into a settlement resolving a putative class action lawsuit relating to its filing of affidavits or other documents in connection with mortgage foreclosure proceedings, and the court granted final approval of the settlement in January 2015. One&#32;shareholder derivative action has been filed in New York Supreme Court against the Firm's Board of Directors alleging that the Board failed to exercise adequate oversight as to wrongful conduct by the Firm regarding mortgage servicing. In December 2014, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal.The Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an investigation concerning the Firm's compliance with the Fair Housing Act (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) and Equal Credit Opportunity Act (&#8220;ECOA&#8221;) in connection with its mortgage lending practices.&#160;In addition, three&#32;municipalities and a school district have commenced litigation against the Firm alleging violations of an unfair competition law and of the FHA and ECOA and seeking statutory damages for the unfair competition claim, and, for the FHA and ECOA claims, damages in the form of lost tax revenue and increased municipal costs associated with foreclosed properties. The court denied a motion to dismiss in one of the municipal actions, the school district action was dismissed with prejudice, another municipal action was recently served, and motions to dismiss are pending in the remaining actions.&nbsp;The Firm has received inquiries from federal government authorities seeking information regarding documents filed by the Firm in bankruptcy proceedings, including proofs of claim, mortgage payment change notices, affidavits, declarations and other sworn statements. The Firm is responding to these inquiries. In March 2015, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A entered into a settlement agreement with the Executive Office for United States Bankruptcy Trustees and the United States Trustee Program to resolve issues relating to mortgage payment change notices and escrow statements in bankruptcy proceedings. Municipal Derivatives Litigation. Several civil actions were commenced in New York and Alabama courts against the Firm relating to certain Jefferson County, Alabama (the &#8220;County&#8221;) warrant underwritings and swap transactions. The claims in the civil actions generally alleged that the Firm made payments to certain third parties in exchange for being chosen to underwrite more than $3 billion&#32;in warrants issued by the County and to act as the counterparty for certain swaps executed by the County. The County filed for bankruptcy in November 2011. In June 2013, the County filed a Chapter 9 Plan of Adjustment, as amended (the &#8220;Plan of Adjustment&#8221;), which provided that all the above-described actions against the Firm would be released and dismissed with prejudice. In November 2013, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of Adjustment, and in December 2013, certain sewer rate payers filed an appeal challenging the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment. All conditions to the Plan of Adjustment's effectiveness, including the dismissal of the actions against the Firm, were satisfied or waived and the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Adjustment occurred in December 2013. Accordingly, all the above-described actions against the Firm have been dismissed pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Adjustment. The appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming the Plan of Adjustment remains pending.Parmalat.&#32;In 2003, following the bankruptcy of the Parmalat group of companies (&#8220;Parmalat&#8221;), criminal prosecutors in Italy investigated the activities of Parmalat, its directors and the financial institutions that had dealings with them following the collapse of the company. In March 2012, the criminal prosecutor served a notice indicating an intention to pursue criminal proceedings against four&#32;former employees of the Firm (but not against the Firm) on charges of conspiracy to cause Parmalat's insolvency by underwriting bonds and continuing derivatives trading when Parmalat's balance sheet was false.&#32;A preliminary hearing, in which the judge will determine whether to recommend that the matter go to a full trial, is ongoing, and the next court hearing is scheduled for July 2015.In addition, the administrator of Parmalat commenced five&#32;civil actions against JPMorgan Chase entities including: two&#32;claw-back actions; a claim relating to bonds issued by Parmalat in which it is alleged that JPMorgan Chase kept Parmalat &#8220;artificially&#8221; afloat and delayed the declaration of insolvency; and similar allegations in two&#32;claims relating to derivatives transactions.150<hr
