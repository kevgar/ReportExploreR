Chase's actual results may differ materially from those set forthin such forward-looking statements. Reference is made to Chase's reports filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the 1997 AnnualReport, for a discussion of factors that may cause such differences to occur.See Glossary of Terms on page 38 for a definition of terms used throughout thisForm 10-Q.OVERVIEWOperating net income for the 1998 second quarter increased 11% to $1.08 billionfrom the second quarter of 1997. Diluted operating earnings per share were $1.21for the second quarter of 1998, a 14% increase when compared with $1.06 in thesame 1997 period.Operating net income for the 1998 first six months increased to $2.13 billionfrom $1.92 billion for the same 1997 period. Diluted operating earnings pershare were $2.38 for the first six months of 1998, a 16% increase when comparedwith $2.06 in the same 1997 period. The results for the 1998 second quarter andfirst six months reflected strong performances in Global Banking, GlobalServices and National Consumer Services, all of which had double-digit increasesin revenues and cash operating earnings, benefiting from their exceptionalcompetitive positions and a corporate-wide focus on financial discipline.For the second quarter of 1998, reported net income was $1.07 billion or $1.20per share on a diluted basis, compared with $925 million or $1.00 per share on adiluted basis for the 1997 second quarter. For the first six months of 1998,reported net income was $1.80 billion or $2.00 per share on a diluted basis,compared with $1.85 billion or $1.99 per share on a diluted basis for the same1997 period. The results for the 1998 first six months reflected apreviously-announced, one-time charge of $510 million ($320 million after-tax)taken in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions and realigncertain business functions. It is anticipated that annual savings from theseactions will amount to approximately $460 million, which will be reinvested inChase's high-growth businesses. For a reconciliation of operating earnings toreported net income, see page 19.Second quarter 1998 financial highlights included: - Total operating revenues increased 14%. - Operating earnings rose 11%. - Return on common stockholders' equity was 20.2%. - Shareholder Value Added increased by 20% to $441 million. - Asia's impact contained.Total nonperforming assets at June 30, 1998 were $1.37 billion compared with$1.02 billion at December 31, 1997. Nonperforming assets related to Asia(including derivatives) increased to $286 million at June 30, 1998, while Asiancommercial net charge-offs for the 1998 second quarter were $122 million. Totalexposure to Indonesia, Korea and Thailand was reduced by 17% to $6.2 billion atJune 30, 1998 from $7.5 billion at March 31, 1998. Total exposure to thesecountries has been reduced by 39% since December 31, 1997.On May 19, 1998, the stockholders approved a two-for-one stock split of Chasecommon stock. The additional shares issued as a result of the split weredistributed at the close of business on June 12, 1998 to stockholders of recordat the close of business on May 20, 1998.At June 30, 1998, Chase's Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were 8.2% and11.9%, respectively, and at this date, Chase and each of its depositoryinstitutions was "well capitalized." -13-  14LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSAs of January 1, 1998, Chase adopted Shareholder Value Added (SVA) as itsprimary measure of business unit performance. SVA represents operating earningsexcluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles (i.e., cashoperating earnings) less an explicit charge for allocated capital. Additionalrefinements have been made to the methodology for the allocation of capital tothe various lines of business during the 1998 second quarter. Prior periods havebeen restated to reflect these changes. For a further discussion of Chase's lineof business franchises and its capital allocation method under SVA, reference ismade to pages 21 and 24-25 of the 1997 Annual Report.LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTSManagement measures Chase's financial performance and that of its business unitsbased on operating earnings, which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations, restructuring costs and special items.(a) Only the global banking portion of Chase Texas is reported in the total Global Banking line of business results. The consumer- and global services-related results for Chase Texas are reported as part of National Consumer Services ("NCS") and Chase Technology Solutions ("CTS") lines of business results, respectively.(b) Total column includes the non-Global Services portion of CTS and Corporate results. See description of CTS and Corporate on page 18.(c) Trading-related net interest income is reflected in Noninterest Revenue - Operating.(d) Cash Operating Earnings represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles. -14-  15Chase's financial performance goals over the next several years include anaverage return on common equity of 18% or higher, growth in operating revenuesaccelerating to 10% per year and double-digit growth in operating earnings pershare.GLOBAL BANKINGGlobal Banking operating revenues rose 15% in both the 1998 second quarter andfor the first six months, with cash operating earnings rising 11% and 16%,respectively. SVA increased by 28% to $315 million in the 1998 second quarterand by 40% to $622 million for the first six months of 1998. These favorableresults were driven by higher investment banking fees and revenue fromequity-related investments.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within Global Banking for the periods indicated.GLOBAL BANKING:GLOBAL MARKETSGlobal Markets' activities encompass the trading and sales of foreign exchange,derivatives, fixed-income securities and commodities. As a leader in capitalmarkets, Chase operates 24 hours a day covering the major internationalcross-border financial markets, as well as many local markets, in both developedand emerging countries. Global Markets is a recognized world leader in such keyactivities as foreign exchange, interest rate swaps and emerging markets debt.Trading-related revenue for the second quarter of 1998 was $517 million, adecrease of 18% from 1997 second quarter's results, as strong growth inclient-driven business and foreign exchange trading was offset by lowerfixed-income results, primarily related to emerging markets. For the first sixmonths of 1998, trading-related revenue was up slightly due to an attractiveforeign exchange environment. The 1998 six-month results reflect higherincentive costs. Also included within Global Markets are Chase's domestic andinternational treasury units, which have the primary responsibility for Chase'sasset/liability management activities ("ALM"). ALM activities in the treasuryunits are managed on a total-return basis with one of the primary objectivesbeing the creation of economic value over time. Total return combines thereported revenues (net interest income and securities gains/losses) and thechange in the net unrealized appreciation/depreciation of all financialinstruments and underlying balance sheet items. In the second quarter and firstsix months of 1998, the total return (pre-tax before expenses) from ALMactivities amounted to $167 million and $252 million, respectively. The 1997second quarter and first six months amounts were $222 million and $423 million,respectively. -15-  16GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKINGGlobal Investment Banking finances and advises corporations, financialinstitutions, financial sponsors and governments by providing integratedone-stop financial solutions and industry expertise to clients globally. Clientindustry groups include chemicals, financial institutions, healthcare,insurance, media and telecommunications, multinationals, natural resources, oiland gas, power and environmental, real estate, retail, transportation andbroker/dealers. The product offerings encompass syndicated finance, high-yieldsecurities, mergers and acquisitions advisory, project finance, real estateadvisory and placement, restructuring and private placements. Chase continues tomaintain its lead position in loan syndications and in leveraged finance. Cashoperating earnings in the second quarter of 1998 rose 19% to $94 million, andfor the first six months of 1998 increased by $118 million to $203 million, whencompared with the same 1997 periods. The 1998 results reflect strong revenuegrowth in a favorable market for all major business lines, including high-yieldbond underwriting, loan syndications and mergers and acquisitions advisoryactivity.CORPORATE LENDINGCorporate Lending provides credit and lending services to clients globally. Theproduct offerings encompass global corporate lending, credit analysis and agentbank services for all industry groups. An active portfolio management effort isan integral part of corporate lending activities. Cash operating earnings in thesecond quarter of 1998 rose $10 million when compared with the 1997 secondquarter due to a 6% increase in revenue from higher loan volume. For the firstsix months of 1998, cash operating earnings decreased 6% due to the sale of aninvestment in the 1998 first quarter, which had contributed revenues during1997.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERSChase Capital Partners ("CCP") is a global private equity organization withapproximately $6.1 billion under management, including $4.6 billion inequity-related investments. CCP provides equity and mezzanine financing in theUnited States and abroad. During the first half of 1998, CCP's directinvestments approximated $870 million in 62 venture capital, management buyout,recapitalization, growth equity and mezzanine transactions, compared withapproximately $250 million in 30 direct investments during the same period in1997. CCP cash operating earnings rose by $102 million for the 1998 secondquarter and by $180 million for the 1998 first six months, reflecting CCP'saccelerated pace of investment activities over the last several years, as wellas favorable market conditions thus far in 1998.GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT AND PRIVATE BANKING The Global Asset Management andPrivate Banking Group serves a global client base of high net worth individualsand families, and institutional, mutual fund and self-directed investors.Services include investment management for institutional investors globally,Chase Vista Mutual Funds (at June 30, 1998, the third largest bank-managedmutual fund family in the U.S.) and a full range of integrated private bankingcapabilities, investment management and advisory services, trust and estateplanning, global custody, global mutual funds, credit and banking, andphilanthropic advisory services. Total assets under management amounted to $177billion at June 30, 1998. Earnings for the first half of 1998 were driven by a16% growth in revenue, benefiting from increased fee income, particularlyrelated to investment management, advisory and trust services, and theaccelerating growth of Chase's asset management and mutual fund businesses.MIDDLE MARKETChase is the premier provider of financial services to middle-market companies(companies with sales ranging from $10 million to $500 million) regionally, witha national focus in selected industries. It is also the market leader in the NewYork metropolitan tri-state area where it has relationships with 53% of middlemarket companies and is lead bank for 25% of these companies. Cash operatingearnings decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 1998 whencompared with the 1997 results reflecting lower spreads, an increase in expensesand lower securities gains.CHASE TEXASChase Texas is the primary bank for more large corporations and middle marketcompanies than any other bank in Texas. Chase Texas also maintains a strongconsumer banking presence through its 123 locations. Additionally, Chase Texasis the largest bank for personal and corporate trust services in the Southwest.Operating revenues increased 19% for the 1998 second quarter and 17% for thefirst six months of 1998 when compared with the same periods in 1997, reflectingincreased overall business volume, record corporate finance fees in the secondquarter, higher loan and deposit volumes, and securities gains.NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICES (NCS)For the 1998 second quarter and first six months, NCS's cash operating earningsincreased $44 million and $68 million, respectively, over the same 1997 periods.The six month increase in cash operating earnings is attributable to an 11%increase in revenue due primarily to the acquisition of The Bank of New York's("BONY") credit card portfolio in November 1997. NCS's expenses increased in thefirst six months of 1998, primarily as a result of higher credit costs forcredit cards and auto loans. SVA for the 1998 second quarter was consistent withthe 1997 second quarter. SVA was down $14 million for the 1998 first six monthsfrom the 1997 comparable period. The decline in SVA was due to increased capitalallocation to NCS as a result of recent acquisitions. -16-  17The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within NCS for the periods indicated.NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICES:(a) Insurance products, which are managed within Diversified Consumer Services, but included for reporting purposes in Cardmember Services, Regional Consumer Banking, and Chase Home Finance, generated revenues of $29 million and $26 million in the second quarter of 1998 and 1997, respectively, and $58 million and $51 million for the first six months of 1998 and 1997, respectively.CARDMEMBER SERVICESChase Cardmember Services ("CCS") ranks as the fourth largest bank card issuerin the United States. CCS also reflects the results of Chase's international consumer business, which includes The Manhattan Card Company Limited, the third-largest credit card issuer in Hong Kong (which became wholly owned in 1998), and includes consumer banking activities in Hong Kong, Panama and the Eastern Caribbean. At June 30, 1998, CCS has a $32 billion managed worldwide credit card portfolio. CCS's cash operating earnings for the second quarter of 1998 were $123 million, a $53 million or 76% increase, over 1997. Earnings for the first six months of 1998 rose 55% to $244 million. Revenues increased 24% for the second quarter (20% for the first half of 1998) as Chase's domestic portfolio continued to benefit from acquisitions and increased co-branding activities. These positive results were partially offset by increased charge-offs and the effect of the economic environment in Asia on Chase's international consumer businesses.REGIONAL CONSUMER BANKINGAt June 30, 1998, Regional Consumer Banking has a leading share of primary bankrelationships among consumers and small businesses in the New York metropolitantri-state area. It is also a leading retail institution in key Texas markets.Regional Consumer Banking offers customers convenient access to financialservices through the largest branch and proprietary ATM networks in the NYmetropolitan region plus state-of-the-art telephone, PC and Internet services.Cash operating earnings for the second quarter and first half of 1998 were lowerwhen compared with 1997, reflecting higher expenses related to systemsintegration and enhancements, particularly within Chase Texas' retailbusinesses.CHASE HOME FINANCEAt June 30, 1998, Chase Home Finance is the third-largest originator andservicer of residential mortgage loans in the U.S., serving more than 2 millioncustomers nationwide. It is also a leading provider of home-equity securedlending and manufactured housing financing. At June 30, 1998, Chase'sresidential first mortgage servicing portfolio totaled $178 billion. During thefirst six months of 1998, $34 billion in residential first mortgage loans wereoriginated which was a 110% increase over the same period last year. Chase HomeFinance's operating revenues improved in 1998 reflecting strong mortgage bankingactivity offset by the impact of lower interest rates and prepayments on Chase'smortgage and home equity portfolios. Cash operating earnings declined $5 millionin the 1998 second quarter to $61 million, and were flat for the first sixmonths of 1998 when compared with comparable periods in 1997. Included in the1997 results are revenues from certain divested businesses (recreationalvehicles and marine). Cash operating earnings would have risen 4% excluding theimpact from the discontinued product lines.DIVERSIFIED CONSUMER SERVICESDiversified Consumer Services ("DCS") is a leading provider of automobilefinancing, student lending, and unsecured consumer lending. At June 30, 1998,Chase Auto Finance had $13 billion in retained outstandings with $6 billion innew originations for the first half of 1998. In addition to its financingactivities, DCS offers brokerage services, insurance and investment productsnationwide. DCS's operating revenues increased 13% in the 1998 second quarterand 12% for the first six months from comparable 1997 periods as a result ofstrong growth in Chase's auto finance and investment businesses. However, cashoperating earnings for both 1998 periods remained relatively flat with 1997, asa result of higher expenses and an increase in the credit provision associatedwith loan volume growth. -17-  18CHASE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONSChase Technology Solutions ("CTS") combines Chase's global services businesses,information technology and operations, and electronic commerce initiatives intoa single group. Global Services is a leading provider of information andtransaction services globally and includes custody, cash management, trust andother fiduciary services. As the world's largest provider of global custody anda leader in trust and agency services, Global Services was custodian for over $4trillion in assets and serviced over $3 trillion in outstanding debt at June 30,1998. Global Services also operates the largest U.S. dollar funds transferbusiness in the world and is a market leader in FedWire, ACH and CHIPS volume.Cash operating earnings for Global Services in the second quarter of 1998 were$116 million, an increase of $16 million or 16% from second quarter 1997. Forthe first six months of 1998, cash operating earnings increased $38 million or19% from the same 1997 period. SVA for Global Services in the 1998 secondquarter and first six months increased 40% and 49%, respectively, when comparedwith the same 1997 periods. These improvements resulted from revenue growthacross all three businesses within Global Services (Chase Treasury Solutions,global investor services and global trust), reflecting increased balances, newbusiness initiatives, market appreciation, as well as higher fees resulting froman acquisition in the fourth quarter of 1997. Earnings also benefited fromcontinued productivity gains, tempered by technology investments related topreparations for Year 2000 and European Monetary Union ("EMU").CORPORATECorporate includes the effects remaining at the Corporate level after theimplementation of management accounting policies, including residual creditprovision and tax expense. Corporate also includes unallocated special items.For the second quarter of 1998, Corporate had a cash operating loss (includingthe nonglobal services portion of CTS) of $56 million compared with a cashoperating loss of $51 million in 1997. For the first six months of 1998,Corporate had a cash operating loss of $133 million compared with a cashoperating loss of $74 million in 1997. -18-  19RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING RESULTSThe following supplemental information provides a reconciliation between Chase'sreported results and Chase's results on an operating basis.(a) Represents results as reported in Chase's financial statements, except restructuring costs have been separately displayed and foreclosed property expense is included in credit costs. (b) Represents the impact of credit card securitizations. For the second quarter, the line items on the income statement impacted are net interest income ($371 million in 1998 and $296 million in 1997), provision for credit losses ($286 million in 1998 and $267 million in 1997), credit card revenue ($87 million in 1998 and $26 million in 1997) and other revenue (($2) million in 1998 and $3 million in 1997). For the first six months, the line items on the income statement impacted are net interest income ($719 million in 1998 and $594 million in 1997), provision for credit losses ($566 million in 1998 and $481 million in 1997), credit card revenue ($153 million in 1998 and $94 million in 1997) and other revenue (no impact in 1998 and $19 million in 1997).(c) Includes restructuring costs and special items.Restructuring costs for the first six months of 1998 reflect the $510 million pre-tax charge ($320 million after-tax) taken in connection with initiatives to streamline support functions, and residual costs of $19 million pre-tax ($13 million after-tax) related to the merger restructuring charge.(d) Includes restructuring costs and special items. Special items for the first six months of 1997 reflect a $44 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a partially-owned foreign investment, a $50 million pre-tax charge for the accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards, and merger-related restructuring costs. -19-  20To facilitate analysis of Chase's financial results, management categorizes therevenue components of the operating income statement as either market-sensitiveor non-market-sensitive revenues. Chase's market-sensitive revenues includetrading revenues (including trading-related net interest income), investmentbanking fees, securities gains and revenue from equity-related investments.Non-market-sensitive revenues, which are subject to less market volatility,include all the remaining revenue components on the income statement.Market-sensitive revenues are affected by many factors, including Chase's creditstanding and its success in proprietary positioning, as well as general economicconditions (both domestic and international), the fiscal policies of centralbanks and governments which affect the financial markets (including domestic andforeign interest rates), the volatility of interest rates, equity and debtmarkets and currencies (including volatility associated with the introduction ofthe euro), and other political, social and diplomatic developments. Accordingly,Chase expects its market-sensitive revenue will fluctuate as these factors varyfrom period to period.Although Chase's market-sensitive revenues will experience volatility from timeto time, over the past ten years Chase's market- sensitive revenues haveincreased at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 14%. Growth inmarket-sensitive revenues for both the 1998 second quarter and first halfexceeded the trend line, benefiting from the good market environment and actionstaken by Chase in offering a new array of products to customers.Non-market-sensitive revenues increased by 10% in the 1998 second quarter and 8%for the 1998 first six months, when compared with the same 1997 periods. Theincreases were the result of higher trust, custody and investment managementfees and credit card revenue.REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below discusses Chase's reported results of operations. Reportedresults include the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costsand special items.NET INTEREST INCOMEbp - Denotes basis pointsReported net interest income for the 1998 second quarter was $2,036 million, anincrease of $30 million from the 1997 second quarter. For the first six months,reported net interest income was $4,200 million in 1998, an increase of $126million from 1997. Both 1998 periods reflect a higher level of averageinterest-earning assets, primarily loans (both consumer and commercial) andsecurities. Net yield on interest-earning assets declined 10 basis points duringthe 1998 second quarter and 15 basis points during the first six months of 1998from comparable 1997 periods, primarily due to generally narrower spreads oncommercial and consumer loans and a higher level of lower-yielding earningassets. -20-  21Average interest-earning assets retained on the balance sheet increased by 5% inthe second quarter of 1998 and 9% in the first six months of 1998 when comparedwith the same 1997 periods, principally as a result of the increase in loanvolume and securities. Average loans retained increased $11.4 billion in the1998 second quarter and $14.3 billion in the first six months of 1998, whencompared with the same periods in 1997. The increase in average loans retainedwas divided between the consumer and commercial portfolios, while the increasein securities was principally in the domestic available-for-sale portfolio. Thegrowth in interest-earning assets in both 1998 periods was funded by higherdeposit levels and, in the first six months of 1998, by higher levels of Federalfunds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, which providedshort-term funding for trading-related positions.PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSESChase's provision for credit losses, which equaled net charge-offs, amounted to$338 million in the 1998 second quarter and $682 million for the first sixmonths of 1998, compared with $189 million and $409 million, respectively, forthe prior-year periods. For a discussion of Chase's net charge-offs, see theCredit Risk Management Section on pages 26-29.Management expects that the provision for credit losses for full-year 1998 willbe higher than the full-year 1997 provision as a result of a higher volume ofcredit card outstandings as well as increased charge-offs from the Asiancommercial portfolio.NONINTEREST REVENUEThe 1998 second quarter and the 1998 first six months continued Chase's strongrevenue trend with quarterly record results in several areas (notably investmentbanking and equity-related revenues as well as trust fees and credit cardrevenue).Investment banking fees of $438 million (a record high) in the 1998 secondquarter and $799 million for the 1998 first six months were higher by 55% and74%, respectively, than the same 1997 periods. These results reflect strongrevenue growth in a favorable market for all major business lines, includinghigh-yield and investment-grade bond underwriting, loan syndications, andmergers and acquisitions advisory activity. -21-  22(a) For the definitions of the above captions, see page 26 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.Trust, custody and investment management fees continued the record setting paceof 1997 and first quarter 1998 by rising 19% to a new record of $383 million inthe 1998 second quarter, and increasing 16% to $731 million in the first sixmonths. These favorable results were largely attributable to growth in assetsunder custody, expanded securities lending activity, and a higher level ofassets under management (including at Chase Vista mutual funds).Credit card revenue rose $141 million, or 63%, in the 1998 second quarter and$180 million, or 37%, in the 1998 first half as a result of continued growth inmanaged credit card receivables, including the acquisition of BONY's credit cardportfolio in late 1997, and increased co-branded activities. The increases inrevenue were partially offset by a rise in net charge-offs on the securitizedportfolio, which reduced the excess servicing fees Chase received from thesecuritizations. Average managed worldwide credit card receivables grew to $31.9billion in the second quarter of 1998, compared with $26.1 billion for the prioryear's second quarter. For a further discussion of the credit card portfolio,see page 27 of this Form 10-Q.The rise in fees in lieu of compensating balances reflects, in part, higher feesfor services paid by customers, rather than customers maintaining a higher levelof compensating balances in the current lower interest-rate environment.Mortgage servicing fees declined in both the 1998 second quarter and first sixmonths largely due to the impact of prepayments as a result of a lowerinterest-rate environment; however, lower interest rates benefited mortgageoriginations and sales revenues, which are reported in other revenues, asdiscussed on page 23 of this Form 10-Q. The higher level of loan commitment feesfor both 1998 periods was largely a reflection of increased activity in Chase'sacquisition financing business. Higher fees related to insurance products,investment services and loans securitized contributed to the increase in otherfees.(a) For a definition of trading-related net interest income, see Note Two of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.(b) For the classes of financial instruments included, see Note Two of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. -22-  23Total trading revenues were $517 million for the 1998 second quarter, a declinefrom the second quarter of 1997, as strong growth in client-driven business andforeign exchange trading was offset by lower fixed income results, primarilyrelated to emerging markets. Total trading revenues for the 1998 first sixmonths were up slightly from the same 1997 period, due to strong 1998 firstquarter results, primarily reflecting a favorable foreign exchange environment.Interest rate contract revenues declined for both periods, mainly due to weakerresults in the U.S., especially in several structured products. The rise inforeign exchange revenue reflected strong earnings across a broad spectrum ofcurrencies, with particular emphasis on Asian markets where volatility continuedto remain high. The decline in debt instruments and other revenue wasattributable to weak markets in Eastern European and Latin American debtinstruments partially offset by strong performances from various non-interestrate derivative product lines.Securities gains of $98 million in the 1998 second quarter (more than triple the1997 second quarter's results) and $181 million in the 1998 first half (anincrease of 38% from the same 1997 period) were realized in connection withChase's asset/liability management activities. The higher gains in the 1998periods were largely from sales of U.S. Government and agency securities in theavailable-for-sale portfolio.Revenue from equity-related investments includes income from a wide variety ofinvestments both in the United States and abroad. The 1998 second quarterresults of $370 million were again a record for Chase and were significantlyhigher than the prior year's quarter (increasing 93%) and the quarterly averageof approximately $206 million for the previous eight quarters. First half 1998results increased 86% to $663 million. The higher revenues in both periodsreflect the continued benefit of Chase's accelerated pace of investmentactivities over the last several years as well as the favorable marketconditions during 1998. At June 30, 1998, the carrying value of Chase'sequity-related investments approximated $4.6 billion.Other revenue, which includes gains and losses from the sale of nonstrategicassets and from securitizations, amounted to $233 million for the second quarterof 1998, a rise of $114 million from the prior year's second quarter, and was$329 million for the first half of 1998. The 1998 second quarter and first sixmonths results included higher revenue from residential mortgage originationsand portfolio sales activities, a reflection of a favorable interest-rateenvironment. Also contributing to the improvement in other revenue in both 1998periods were gains on a variety of nonstrategic assets and the reclassificationof income (from net interest income to other revenue) from a loan and securitiesportfolio that was transferred into a trust, the shares of which are being soldto private banking and institutional investors. The 1997 first half resultsincluded a $44 million gain on the sale of a partially-owned foreign investment.The 1997 second quarter and first half also included $18 million and $32million, respectively, of equity income from Chase's investment in CIT GroupHoldings, Inc. (Chase's remaining 20% interest in CIT was sold in the fourthquarter of 1997).NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense, excluding restructuring costs, was $2,714 million in the1998 second quarter, an increase of 12% from the prior year's quarter, and was$5,334 million for the first half of 1998, an increase of 10% from the same 1997period. Increased revenues across a spectrum of Global Banking businessescontributed to an increase in incentive costs. The balance of the increase forboth 1998 periods reflects operating costs related to portfolio acquisitions,investment spending on new product offerings and Year 2000, EMU integration andother technology spending. Noninterest expense including restructuring costs was$2,722 million in the 1998 second quarter and $5,863 million for the first sixmonths of 1998, an increase of 10% and 19%, respectively, from the 1997 secondquarter and first six months, respectively. -23-  24(a) Excludes the REIT.(b) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.The increase in salaries for the 1998 second quarter and first six months wasprimarily due to higher incentive costs as a result of higher earnings across anumber of businesses and competitive market pressures across many segments ofGlobal Banking. Included in the 1997 six month period was a charge of $50million reflecting the accelerated vesting of stock-based incentive awards.The increased staff levels during the 1998 second quarter were primarily in NCS,reflecting increased staffing demands as a result of portfolio acquisitions andvolume growth.The higher level of equipment expense during the 1998 second quarter and firstsix months was primarily the result of increased software expense related toYear 2000 and EMU efforts as well as the integration of processing systemsthroughout Chase and technology expenditures necessary to support targetedgrowth businesses. -24-  25Other expense for the 1998 second quarter and first six months increased $128million and $178 million, respectively, when compared with the second quarterand first six months of 1997. Professional services costs for both 1998 periodsreflected higher levels of contract computer professionals associated withplanned Year 2000 and the EMU efforts. The $18 million rise intelecommunications costs in the 1998 second quarter and $20 million increase forthe first half of 1998, primarily reflects the growth in business volume at allof Chase's major business franchises, covering both installation and usage.Travel and entertainment expense increased 10% in the 1998 second quarter and 6%for the first six months of 1998 due, in part, to increased staff levels. Thepurchase of the BONY credit card portfolio in late 1997 contributed to theincrease in amortization of intangibles expense, while the increased servicingcosts for the portfolio contributed to the increase in all other expense. Theseincreases were partially offset by a decline in minority interest expense due tothe acquisition of minority interest in a foreign investment in the 1998 firstquarter.For a discussion of Chase's restructuring costs, see Note Eight on page 9 ofthis Form 10-Q.Year 2000 and EMU: For a discussion of Chase's Year 2000 and the EMU efforts, see pages 28-29 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. The information below updates Chase's Year 2000 and EMU disclosures:Chase continues to work actively on its Year 2000 computer readiness. During thefirst half of 1998, Chase made substantial progress in remediating and testingits internal systems, as well as in working with external parties (vendors,outside service providers, infrastructure suppliers (e.g., telecom providers),customers, industry groups, clearing houses and regulatory agencies) todetermine their Year 2000 readiness.Chase tracks its Year 2000 progress against a set of detailed milestones.During the second quarter of 1998, Chase reached a major project milestone: Year2000 compliance of its technical infrastructure (e.g., data center equipment,LAN servers) and systems software. This internal milestone was met with 97% ofChase's identified technical components being made Year 2000 compliant. Inaddition, by June 30, 1998, over half of Chase's software applications had beenremediated for the Year 2000. The balance of this remediation work remains onschedule for completion.Third party vendor-supplied software packages are being closely tracked, withapproximately 70% of the total number of packages identified as needing upgradehaving been delivered to-date. Year 2000 internal and external test scheduleshave been established, and a significant portion of testing is in progress.External testing has begun for securities clearance and electronic payments, andschedules are being coordinated with financial markets infrastructureorganizations, such as the New York Clearing House, Depository Trust Company,Federal Reserve, and Securities Industry Association. Testing with third partiesis critical since a failure of a major external interface could have a materialadverse effect on the operations of Chase. During the remainder of 1998, Chase will be completing the major internalsystems work. Efforts will continue to evolve from a focus on remediation andtesting to identifying and assessing areas of additional business risk(including any business risks that could occur upon the failure of an externalparty) and adjusting or creating contingency plans as appropriate.As a worldwide provider of foreign exchange, custody, cash management, andfunds transfer services, and because Chase has an extensive internationalbranch and subsidiary network, Chase has also been actively preparing for theintroduction of the "euro", currently scheduled to occur on January 1, 1999. Adedicated EMU project team has been in place since November 1996 so that Chaseproducts, technology, business operations and customer service functionsworldwide will be appropriately modified and "euro-capable" by January 1, 1999.Risk assessment reviews are made regularly to track progress against a detailedtimeline. Remediation of all critical operating systems is intended to becompleted by August 31, 1998 with the testing of all systems, involving Chaselocations worldwide that will be impacted by the euro conversion, scheduled overthe remaining four months of the year. As part of its preparations, Chase hasbeen working closely with its customers, counterparties and regulatory agenciesin order to mitigate the payment and settlement risks resulting from the euro'sintroduction. Chase has also been actively developing contingency plans to dealwith any liquidity issues that may result from misrouted funds because ofthese changes in payment or settlement procedures.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $631 million in the second quarter of1998 compared with $555 million in the second quarter of 1997. The effective taxrate for each period was 37.0% and 37.5%, respectively. For the first sixmonths, Chase recorded income tax expense of $1.06 billion in 1998, comparedwith $1.11 billion in 1997, at an effective tax rate of 37.0% and 37.5%,respectively. -25-  26CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1997 and should be read in conjunction withpages 29-37 and 52 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Represents loans secured primarily by real property, other than loans secured by mortgages on 1-4 family residential properties.(b) Total loans, excluding the impact of credit card securitizations, at June 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997 were $186,924 million and $185,306 million, respectively. -26-  27LOAN SUMMARYThe slight increase in retained loans outstanding is the result of an increasein commercial loans. Based upon industry classifications utilized by Chase,there were no commercial and industrial industry segments which exceeded 5% oftotal commercial and industrial loans outstanding. During the 1998 secondquarter, exposures to Asia continued to decrease and Asian charge-offs werepartially offset by recoveries in the rest of the commercial portfolio.Chase's nonperforming assets at June 30, 1998 increased $347 million from the1997 year-end level primarily due to an increase in nonperforming Asian assetsand, to a lesser extent, domestic commercial loans. Management expects thatduring the remainder of 1998, there will be an increase in nonperforming assetsfrom the June 30, 1998 level, primarily as a result of continuing uncertainty inthe financial conditions of certain Asian countries.Total net charge-offs on a retained basis increased by $149 million during the1998 second quarter and by $273 million for the first six months, when comparedto the same 1997 periods. Total net charge-offs on a managed basis were $624million in the 1998 second quarter, compared with $456 million in the secondquarter of 1997. For the first six months of 1998, total net charge-offs on amanaged basis were $1,248 million, compared with $890 million in 1997. Theincrease in net charge-offs on both a managed and retained basis is due to thegenerally lower credit quality of a recently acquired credit card portfolio, afactor which was anticipated at the time of its acquisition, and increasedforeign commercial charge-offs, primarily as a result of conditions in Asia.CONSUMER PORTFOLIOResidential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $41.2 billion atJune 30, 1998, a $2.5 billion increase from year-end, reflecting higher activitydue to lower interest rates. At June 30, 1998, nonperforming domesticresidential mortgage loans, as a percentage of the domestic residential mortgageloan portfolio, was 0.91%, slightly up from the 1997 year-end level.Credit Card Loans: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a managed basis,which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well as creditcard receivables that have been securitized.The following table presents credit-related information for Chase's domesticmanaged credit card receivables.(a) For the three months ended June 30, 1998, and 1997 and for the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1997, Chase's average aggregate domestic and international managed credit card receivables were $31.9 billion, $26.1 billion, $32.2 billion and $25.9 billion, respectively. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average aggregate domestic and international managed credit card receivables for each of these periods were 5.94%, 5.92%, 5.82% and 5.75%, respectively.The increases in domestic average managed credit card receivables for both thethree and six month periods ended June 30, 1998, when compared with the sameperiods in 1997, were largely the result of the purchase of a credit cardportfolio in late 1997, totaling approximately $4.0 billion in outstandings. Theincrease in net charge-off percentage for both 1998 periods is due to thegenerally lower credit quality of that acquired portfolio, partially offset by alower charge-off percentage in the core portfolio. Management expects thatdomestic credit card net charge-offs, as a percentage of average domesticmanaged credit card receivables, will increase modestly in 1998 when comparedwith 1997.Auto Financings: Auto financings outstanding remained relatively stable andreflected continued strong consumer demand due to favorable pricing programs,partially offset by the impact of auto loan securitizations. Total originationswere $5.9 billion in the first half of 1998, compared with $5.0 billion in thesame 1997 period. Net charge-offs related to auto financings increased in the1998 second quarter and in the first six months, compared with the same 1997periods. The increased level of net charge-offs for both 1998 periods primarilyreflects growth in the portfolio and the unfavorable performance in adiscontinued product line. -27-  28COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIODomestic Commercial: Net charge-off levels in the domestic commercial portfolioremained low during the 1998 second quarter and the portfolio continued tomaintain its strong credit quality.Foreign Commercial: The foreign commercial portfolio totaled $36.2 billion atJune 30, 1998, a decrease of $2.6 billion from the 1997 year-end. Nonperformingloan levels at June 30, 1998, as well as net charge-off levels for the 1998second quarter and first six months, increased in comparison with the respectiveprior year periods, due to financial conditions in Asia.Total nonperforming assets in Asia, including derivatives, increased by $204million from year-end levels and by $43 million from March 31, 1998 to $286million at June 30, 1998. Asian commercial net charge-offs, includingderivatives, for the 1998 second quarter were $122 million and for the firsthalf of 1998 were $214 million, compared with $3 million and $2 million,respectively, in the same 1997 periods.DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange financial instrumentsutilized in connection with Chase's trading and ALM activities, see pages 35-36and Notes One and Eighteen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report. At June 30, 1998, themajority of these transactions were with commercial bank and financialinstitution counterparties, most of which are dealers in these products. Thefollowing table provides the remaining maturities of derivative and foreignexchange contracts outstanding at June 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997. Thelengthening of the maturity profile since year-end is the result of the improvedcreditworthiness of Chase over the last several years (as evidenced by creditrating upgrades) and the maturation of the derivatives market where longermaturities are becoming more commonplace.Chase's net charge-offs arising from derivative and foreign exchangetransactions were $10 million in the 1998 second quarter and $22 million for thefirst six months of 1998. There were no net charge-offs on these types oftransactions during the second quarter and first six months of 1997. At June 30,1998, nonperforming derivative contracts were $28 million, compared with none in1997. The increases in both net charge-offs and nonperforming derivativecontracts were due to the financial conditions in Asia.CROSS-BORDER EXPOSURECredits denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which aborrower is located, such as dollar-denominated loans made overseas, are called"cross-border" credits. The Asian financial turmoil, which started in July 1997,affected many countries where Chase has had long-standing banking relationships.The following table presents Chase's cross-border exposure to selected Asiancountries. For a further discussion of Chase's cross-border exposure to Asiancountries, see pages 34-35 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.(a) Includes loans and accrued interest, interest-bearing deposits with banks, trading debt and equity instruments, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit, undrawn commitments to extend credit and local currency assets, net of local currency liabilities.(b) Foreign exchange largely represents the mark-to-market exposure of spot and forward contracts. Derivatives largely represent the mark-to-market exposure of risk management instruments. Mark-to-market exposure is a measure, at a point in time, of the value of a foreign exchange or derivative contract in the open market. The impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements on these foreign exchange and derivative contracts reduced exposure by $0.7 billion at both June 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997. -28-  29ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESThe following discussion of Chase's allowance for credit losses focusesprimarily on developments since December 31, 1997 and should be read inconjunction with pages 36-37 and Note Five of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.The accompanying tables reflect the activity in and composition of Chase'sallowance for credit losses and certain coverage ratios related to the allowancefor credit losses on loans for the periods indicated.(a) The increases in the aggregate allowance from the June 30, 1997 levels is due in large part to the acquisition of the Bank of New York credit card portfolio in late 1997.The allowance for credit losses provides for risks of losses inherent in thecredit extension process for loans, derivative and foreign exchange financialinstruments and lending-related commitments. Chase deems its allowance forcredit losses at June 30, 1998 to be adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb lossesthat may currently exist for all credit activities, but are not yetidentifiable). Estimating potential future losses is inherently uncertain anddepends on many factors, including general macroeconomic and politicalconditions, rating migration, structural changes within industries which altercompetitive positions, event risk, unexpected correlations within the portfolio,and other external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements. Chaseperiodically reviews such factors and reassesses the adequacy of the allowancefor credit losses. -29-  30MARKET RISK MANAGEMENTThe following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1997 and should be read in conjunction withpages 37-41 and Notes One and Eighteen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.Chase uses both historic simulation and Monte Carlo statistical techniques toestimate a daily value-at-risk ("VAR"). The VAR calculation is performed for allmaterial trading portfolios and market risk-related ALM portfolios, with resultsreported by business unit and in the aggregate. The total VAR for Chase'strading portfolio and market risk-related ALM portfolio as of or for thetwelve-month period ended June 30, 1998 was as follows:NM: Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect.Chase's average aggregate VAR (VAR for both trading and ALM activities), for thetwelve-month period ended June 30, 1998, was $53.8 million. Chase's aggregateVAR at June 30, 1998 was $50.7 million. Chase's aggregate average and period endVAR are less than the sum of the respective trading and ALM VARs shown in theabove table (by $17.5 million and $23.2 million, respectively) due torisk-offsets resulting from portfolio diversification which occur across thetrading and ALM portfolios.Chase was among the earliest adopters of the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision market risk capital rules. Both for regulatory compliance with theBasle rules and for internal evaluation of VAR, Chase conducts daily backtestingof its VAR against trading revenues. For mark-to-market activities, there wereno days in the second quarter of 1998 in which VAR was exceeded by a dailytrading loss.Management believes stress tests are an essential complement to VAR. At Chase,stress tests are an integral part of an effective risk management process, andhave assumed an equal standing to VAR as a risk measurement and controltechnique for market risk. As of June 30, 1998, Chase's corporate monthly stresstests consist of five historical and three hypothetical scenarios for allmaterial trading portfolios and market risk-related ALM portfolios. SinceDecember 31, 1997, stress test results have been incorporated into Chase'sinternal capital allocation methodology, which provides a significant incentivefor active management of aggregate exposures to difficult market environments. -30-  31TRADING ACTIVITIESThe following chart contains a histogram of Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of marked-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income. [Graphic of Daily Changes in Market Risk-Related Trading Revenue - See Appendix 1]Based on actual trading results for the twelve months ended June 30, 1998, Chaseposted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 220 out of 259 businesstrading days with 84 days exceeding positive $15 million over the past twelvemonths. This compares with 53 days exceeding positive $15 million for the twelvemonths ended June 30, 1997. The large increase in days exceeding positive $15million reflected continued efforts to build key trading activities. Chaseincurred six daily trading losses in excess of negative $15 million over thepast twelve months. Four of these six days of losses resulted from sharp pricedeclines and a loss of liquidity for certain securities, particularly emergingmarket debt instruments, during the difficult and unusually volatile tradingmarkets in late October 1997.ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENTMeasuring Interest Rate Sensitivity: Chase, as part of its ALM process, employsa variety of cash (primarily securities) and derivatives instruments in managingits exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. In managing exposure,Chase uses quantifications of net gap exposure and measurements of earnings atrisk (the risk to earnings from adverse movements in interest rates) based onearnings simulations. An example of aggregate net gap analysis is presentedbelow.CONDENSED INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY TABLE -31-  32At June 30, 1998, Chase had $16.4 billion more liabilities than assets repricingwithin one year (including the net repricing effects of derivative positions),or 4% of total assets. This compares with $17.8 billion more liabilities thanassets repricing within one year, or 5% of total assets, at December 31, 1997.This negative gap (more liabilities repricing than assets), will benefitearnings in a declining interest rate environment and will detract from earningsin a rising interest rate environment.At June 30, 1998, based on Chase's simulation model and applying immediateincreases in various market interest rates (100 bp increase for USdollar-denominated positions and a range from 100 bp to 1500 bp increases fornon-US dollar-denominated positions), earnings at risk over the next twelvemonths are estimated to be approximately 2.8% of projected 1998 after-tax income(before restructuring costs). Chase's earnings at risk to an immediate rise ininterest rates was estimated to be approximately 3.5% of after-tax net income atDecember 31, 1997 and 5.5% of after-tax net income at March 31, 1998. The lowerearnings at risk at June 30, 1998, when compared with the March 31, 1998 amount,reflects a lower level of fixed-rate securities funded by floating-rateliabilities. The hypothetical rate shocks are used to calibrate risk that Chasebelieves to be reasonably possible of occurring in the near-term, but thesescenarios do not necessarily represent management's current view of futuremarket developments.Impact of ALM Derivative Activity:The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's ALM activities at June 30, 1998 and December 31, 1997.(a) These net unrecognized losses do not include the net favorable impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENTFor a discussion of Chase's management of its operating risk, see page 41 ofChase's 1997 Annual Report.CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENTThe following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 41-43 and NoteSeventeen of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.CAPITALChase's capital levels at June 30, 1998 remained well in excess of regulatoryguidelines. At June 30, 1998, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 8.2% and11.9%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.3%. At June 30, 1998,the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was$34.1 billion, an increase of $.8 billion from December 31, 1997. This increasefor the first half of 1998 reflects retained earnings (net income less commonand preferred dividends) generated during the period together with the issuanceof $200 million (net of discount) of capital securities issued by certain Chasesubsidiaries (see Note Seven of this Form 10-Q) and the issuance of $200 millionof fixed/adjustable rate noncumulative preferred stock. The increase waspartially offset by the redemption of $772 million of preferred stock bearinghigher dividend rates. -32-  33In the first quarter of 1998, Chase raised the cash dividend on its Common Stockto $.36 per share from $.31 per share. (See Note 2 for a discussion of Chase'stwo-for-one stock split.) Chase has over the past several years been paying acommon stock dividend that has generally been equal to approximately 25% to 35%of Chase's operating net income, less the amount of preferred stock dividends.Chase's future dividend policies will be determined by its Board of Directorstaking into consideration Chase's earnings and financial condition andapplicable governmental regulation and policies.From inception of a stock buy-back program authorized by Chase's Board ofDirectors in October 1996 through June 30, 1998, Chase repurchased 69.3 millionshares of its Common Stock ($3.5 billion) and reissued from treasuryapproximately 40.8 million shares of its Common Stock ($2.0 billion) under itsbenefit plans, resulting in a net repurchase of 28.5 million shares.Management is committed to maintaining a disciplined capital policy for Chase.That policy is intended to increase SVA, to employ capital to support growth,including through acquisitions or other investment opportunities, and to returnexcess capital to stockholders. In light of this policy, management utilizedcapital during the first six months of 1998 to increase Chase's regulatorycapital ratios to within management's target range of 8% - 8.25%. For theremainder of the year, management intends that capital generated in excess oftarget capital ratios will be used to support pending acquisitions and torepurchase additional shares of common stock under the buyback program, althoughthe exact amount of common stock that will be purchased by Chase during theremainder of the year will depend on Chase's future earnings, internal assetgrowth and future investment and acquisition opportunities.LIQUIDITYChase manages its liquidity in order to ensure the availability of sufficientcash flows to meet all of Chase's financial commitments and to capitalize onopportunities for Chase's business expansion. Chase is an active participant inthe capital markets and issues commercial paper, medium-term notes, long-termdebt, and common and preferred stock. At June 30, 1998, Chase's long-term debtwas $14.5 billion. Chase issued $2.1 billion of long-term debt during the firstsix months of 1998; during the same period, $566 million of long-term debtmatured and $428 million was redeemed. During the second quarter of 1998, Chaseissued $200 million of fixed/adjustable rate preferred stock and redeemed $200million of its 7.58% cumulative preferred stock and $200 million of its 7.50%cumulative preferred stock. An additional $140 million of Chase's fixed-ratepreferred stock becomes callable during the remainder of 1998. Chase constantlyevaluates the opportunities to redeem its outstanding debt and preferred stockand to issue new debt and preferred stock in light of current market conditions.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-5 of Chase's 1997 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $2.1 billion atJune 30, 1998. -33-  34ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTSIn June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, which establishes accounting andreporting standards for all derivative instruments, including certain derivativeinstruments embedded in other financial instruments (collectively referred to asderivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that an entitymeasure all derivatives at fair value and recognize those derivatives as eitherassets or liabilities in the balance sheet. The change in a derivative's fairvalue is generally recognized in current period earnings. However, if certainconditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of anexposure to changes in fair value, variability of cash flows, or certain foreigncurrency exposures. Based on the hedge designation, special hedge accountingrules allow the derivative's change in value to be recognized either in currentperiod earnings together with the offsetting change in value of the risk beinghedged, or, to the extent the hedge is effective, in comprehensive income andsubsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.SFAS 133 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, withearly adoption permitted. Chase already recognizes the derivatives used in itstrading activities on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fairvalues of such derivatives included in earnings. This represents the substantialmajority of the derivatives utilized by Chase. With respect to those otherderivatives used as hedges of its assets, liabilities and commitments, Chase isbeginning to assess the impact of the adoption of SFAS 133 on its hedgingactivities and its effect on its financial condition and operating performance.OTHER EVENTSOn May 7, 1998, Chase and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. ("Morgan Stanley")reached a definitive agreement under which Chase will acquire the global custodybusiness of Morgan Stanley, which has more than $400 billion of assets undercustody. The acquisition is expected to be completed during the latter part of1998. The clients and staff joining Chase will be integrated into Chase GlobalInvestor Services, which is part of Chase's Global Services Business included inCTS. -34-  35 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the three months ended June 30, 1998 and June 30, 1997, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.31% and 6.58%, respectively.(c) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -35-  36 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the six months ended June 30, 1998 and June 30, 1997, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 6.43% and 6.63%, respectively.(c) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes. -36-  37 THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) -37-  38 GLOSSARY OF TERMSThe page numbers included after each definition represents the pages in the 10-Qwhere the term is primarily used.1997 Annual Report: Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,1997.
