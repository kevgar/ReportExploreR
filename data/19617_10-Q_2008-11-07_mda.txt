Table of Contentstransaction, represent a one-fourth interest in a share of JPMorgan Chase preferred stock. Inaddition, on July&nbsp;31, 2008, JPMorgan Chase assumed (1)&nbsp;all of Bear Stearns' then-outstandingSEC-registered U.S. debt securities; (2)&nbsp;Bear Stearns' obligations relating to trust preferredsecurities; (3)&nbsp;certain of Bear Stearns' then-outstanding foreign debt securities; and (4)&nbsp;certainof Bear Stearns' guarantees of then-outstanding foreign debt securities issued by subsidiaries ofBear Stearns, in each case, in accordance with the agreements and indentures governing thesesecurities. JPMorgan Chase also guaranteed Bear Stearns' obligations under Bear Stearns' U.S. $30.0billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme and U.S. $4.0&nbsp;billion Euro Note Issuance Programme.Issuance of preferred stockOn April&nbsp;23, 2008, the Firm issued $6.0&nbsp;billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. TheFirm also issued $1.8&nbsp;billion of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock on August&nbsp;21, 2008. Theproceeds of these issuances were used for general corporate purposes. For information regarding thepreferred stock issued by the Firm on July&nbsp;15, 2008, in exchange for the Bear Stearns preferredstock, see &#147;Internal reorganization related to the Merger&#148; above.Proceeds from Visa Inc. sharesOn March&nbsp;19, 2008, Visa Inc. (&#147;Visa&#148;) completed its initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;). Prior to theIPO, JPMorgan Chase held approximately a 13% equity interest in Visa. On March&nbsp;28, 2008, Visa useda portion of the proceeds from the offering to redeem a portion of the Firm's equity interest,which resulted in the recognition of a pretax gain of $1.5&nbsp;billion (recorded in other income). Inconjunction with the IPO, Visa placed $3.0&nbsp;billion in escrow to cover liabilities related tocertain litigation matters. JPMorgan Chase's share of this escrow was $696&nbsp;million. JPMorganChase's interest in the escrow was recorded as a reduction to other expense and reported net ofestablished litigation reserves.Purchase of additional interest in Highbridge Capital ManagementIn January&nbsp;2008, JPMorgan Chase purchased an additional equity interest in Highbridge CapitalManagement, LLC (&#147;Highbridge&#148;). As a result, the Firm currently owns 77.5% of Highbridge. The Firmacquired a majority interest in Highbridge in 2004.NOTE3 &#151; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's valuation methodologies for assets and liabilities measured atfair value, see Note 4 on pages 111&#151;114 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Valuation HierarchySFAS 157 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements.The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset orliability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowestlevel of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.98 Table of ContentsThe following table presents the financial instruments carried at fair value as of September&nbsp;30,2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, by caption on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and by SFAS 157valuation hierarchy (as described above).Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis99 Table of Contents&nbsp;Balances for which the Firm did not bear economic exposure at December&nbsp;31, 2007, were notsignificant.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe table below includes a rollforward of the balance sheet amounts for the three and nine monthsended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007 (including the change in fair value), for financial instrumentsclassified by the Firm within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. When a determination is made toclassify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based upon the significance ofthe unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financialinstruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observablecomponents100 Table of Contents(that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due, in part, toobservable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk manages theobservable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positionsthat are classified within level 1 or 2 of the valuation hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the tables do notreflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.101 Table of Contents&nbsp;102 Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basisCertain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value ona nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basisbut are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there isevidence of impairment). The following table presents the financial instruments carried on theConsolidated Balance Sheets by caption and by level within the SFAS 157 valuation hierarchy (asdescribed above) as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, for which a nonrecurring changein fair value has been recorded during the reporting period.&nbsp;Nonrecurring fair value changesThe following table presents the total change in value of financial instruments for which a fairvalue adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, related to financial instruments held at September&nbsp;30,2008 and 2007.In the above table, loans principally include changes in fair value for loans carried on thebalance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value; and accounts payable, accrued expense and otherliabilities principally include the change in fair value for unfunded lending-related commitmentswithin the leveraged lending portfolio.Level3 analysisLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at the lower of cost or fair value) were 6% of total Firmassets at September&nbsp;30, 2008. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets duringthe period.For the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008Level 3 assets increased $1.3&nbsp;billion in the third quarter of2008, largely as a result of $15.2&nbsp;billion of transfers ofassets into level 3, principally AAA-rated collateralized loanobligations (&#147;CLOs&#148;) backed by corporate loans for which liquidity decreasedand market activity was limited, and $5.8&nbsp;billion of purchased mortgage servicing rights related tothe Washington Mutual transaction. These increases were largely offset by decreases in level 3assets due to $12.3&nbsp;billion of sales and markdowns of residential mortgage exposure and $3.5&nbsp;billion of sales and markdowns ofleveraged loans and transfers of similar leveraged loans to level&nbsp;2 due to the increased price transparency of such assets.103 Table of ContentsFor the nine monthsended September&nbsp;30, 2008Level 3assets increased $57.0&nbsp;billion in the first nine months of 2008, predominantly due to thefollowing:Partiallyoffsetting the increases in level 3 assets described above wereapproximately $14.3&nbsp;billion of sales and markdowns of residential mortgage-backedsecurities, prime residential mortgage loans and Alt-A residential mortgage loans. In addition, leveraged loans includedwithin level 3 assets declined $7.5&nbsp;billion during the period as a result of sales and markdowns,as well as transfers of similar leveraged loans to level 2 due to the increased price transparencyfor such assets.Gains and LossesFor the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008Gains and losses in the tables above include losses on trading debt equity instruments ofapproximately $4.3&nbsp;billion for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, principally frommortgage-related transactions. In addition, the Firm reported net gains ofapproximately $2.5&nbsp;billion related to derivative transactionsand gains of $2.9&nbsp;billion related to structured notes, principally due tosignificant volatility in the fixed income, commodities and equitymarkets.Inaddition there were losses of approximately $860&nbsp;million on leveraged loans. Leveraged loansare typically classified as held-for-sale and measured at the lower of cost or fair value andtherefore included in the nonrecurring fair value assets.For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008Gains and losses in the tables above include losses on trading and debt and equity instruments ofapproximately $7.5&nbsp;billion for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, principally frommortgage-related transactions and auction-rate securities. Inaddition, the Firm reported net gains of $5.3&nbsp;billion related to derivativetransactions and gains of $2.8 billion related to structured notes,principally due to significant volatility in the fixed income,commodities and equity markets.Inaddition, there were losses of approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion on leveraged loans. Leveraged loansare typically classified as held-for-sale and measured at the lower of cost or fair value andtherefore included in the nonrecurring fair value assets.The Firm risk manages level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positionsclassified within level 1 or 2 of the valuation hierarchy; the effect of these risk managementactivities are not reflected in the level 3 gains and losses included in the tables above.For a discussion of changes in fair value of the MSR asset see Note 18 on page 136 of thisForm 10-Q.104 Table of ContentsCertain risk exposures that are carried at fair valueAs noted above, over the past several quarters liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage marketshas decreased thereby limiting the price transparency of certain mortgage-related instruments.The table below summarizes the Firm's mortgage-related exposures that are carried at fair valuethrough earnings or at the lower of cost or fair value; the table excludes securities held in theavailable-for-sale portfolio.&nbsp;Residential mortgagesPrime MortgageThe Firm had exposure of $13.1&nbsp;billion to prime mortgages carried at fair value through earnings orat the lower of cost or fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2008, whichconsisted of $4.5 billion ofsecurities (including $1.9&nbsp;billion of forward purchasecommitments), predominantly rated AAA, and $8.6 billion of first lienmortgages. Net exposure toprime residential mortgages decreased 26% in the quarter, principally due to asset sales and, to alesser extent, declines in asset values.Alt-A mortgageThe Firm had exposure of $5.2&nbsp;billion to Alt-A mortgages carried at fair value through earnings orat the lower of cost or fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2008, whichconsisted of $1.3&nbsp;billion of securities, largely rated AAA, and$3.9&nbsp;billion of first lien mortgages. Netexposure to Alt-A mortgages decreased 38% in the quarter, principallydue to asset sales and, to a lesser extent, declines in asset values.Subprime mortgageThe Firm had exposure of $1.4&nbsp;billion to subprime mortgages carried at fair value through earningsor at the lower of cost or fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2008,which included $1.0&nbsp;billion of securities, largely rated AAA,and $363&nbsp;million of first lien mortgages.Classification and ValuationResidential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities are classified within level 2 or level 3of the valuation hierarchy depending on the level of liquidity and activity in the markets for aparticular product. Level 3 assets include residential whole loans, prime and Alt-A securitiesrated below AAA, subprime securities and single-name credit default swaps (&#147;CDS&#148;) on ABS. Productsthat continue to have reliable price transparency evidenced byconsistent market transactions, suchas AAA&#150;rated Prime and Alt-A securities as well as agencysecurities, continue to be classified inlevel 2.For those products classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, the Firm estimates thevalue of such instruments using a combination of observed transaction prices, independent pricingservices and relevant broker quotes.105 Table of ContentsConsideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationshipof recently evidenced market activity to the prices provided from independent pricing services.When relevant market activity is not occurring or is limited, the fair value of residentialmortgage loans is estimated by projecting the expected cash flows and discounting those cash flowsat a rate reflective of current market liquidity. To estimate theprojected cash flows (inclusiveof prepayment and default rates), specific consideration is given toboth borrower-specific andother market factors including, but not limited to, the borrower's FICO score, the type ofcollateral supporting the loan, an estimate of the current value of the collateral supporting theloan, the level of documentation for the loan and market-derived expectations for home priceappreciation or depreciation in the respective geography of the borrower.When relevant market activity is not occurring or is limited, the fair value of residential mortgage-backedsecurities is estimated considering the value of the collateral (inthis case, the residential mortgage loansfrom which the cash flows on the securities are derived) and the specific attributes of thesecurities held by the Firm. The value of the collateral pool supporting the securities areanalyzed using the same techniques and factors described above for residential mortgage loans albeit in a more aggregated manner across thepool. For example, average FICO scores, average delinquency rates, average loss severities andprepayment rates, among other metrics, may be evaluated. In addition, as each securitizationvehicle distributes cash in a manner or order that is predetermined at the inception of thevehicle, the order in which each particular mortgage-backed security is allocated, cash flows andthe level of credit enhancement in place to support those cash flows are key considerations inderiving the value of the mortgage-backed securities. Finally, the risk premium that investorsdemand for securitized products in today's market is factored into the valuation. To benchmark itsvaluations, the Firm looks to transactions for similar instruments and utilizes independent pricingprovided by third-party vendors, broker quotes and relevant market indices such as the ABX index,as applicable. While none of those sources are solely indicative of fair value, they serve asdirectional indicators for the appropriateness of the Firm's estimates.Commercial mortgagesCommercial mortgages are loans to companies backed by commercial real estate. Commercialmortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by a pool of commercial mortgages.Typically, commercial mortgages have lock-out periods, where the borrower is restricted fromprepaying the loan for a specified timeframe, or periods where there are disincentives for theborrower to prepay the loan due to prepayment penalties. These features reduce prepayment risk forcommercial mortgages relative to that of residential mortgages.The Firm had exposure to $8.3&nbsp;billion of commercial mortgage-backed assets carried at fair valuethrough earnings or at the lower of cost or fair value at September&nbsp;30, 2008, which consisted of$3.5&nbsp;billion of securities, largely rated AAA, and$4.8&nbsp;billion of first lien mortgages, largely in the U.S. Netcommercial mortgage exposure decreased 9% in thequarter, principally due to asset sales and, to a lesser extent, declines in asset values.Classification and ValuationWhile commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities are classified within level 2or level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, depending on the level of liquidity and activity in themarkets, the majority of these mortgages, including both loans and lower-rated securities, arecurrently classified in level 3. Level 2 assets include AAA-rated fixed-rate commercialmortgage-backed securities.For those products classified within level&nbsp;2 of the valuation hierarchy, the Firm estimates the value of such instruments using a combination of observed transaction prices, independent pricing services and relevant broker quotes. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the prices provided from independent pricing services.When relevant market activity is not present or is limited, the value of commercial mortgage loansis estimated by projecting the expected cash flows and discounting those cash flows at a ratereflective of current market liquidity. To estimate the projected cash flows, consideration isgiven to both borrower-specific and other market factors including, but not limited to, theborrower's debt-to-service coverage ratio, the type of commercial property (retail, office,lodging, multi-family, etc.), an estimate of the current loan-to-value ratio and market-derivedexpectations for property price appreciation or depreciation in the respective geographic location.When relevant market activity is not present or is limited, the value of commercial mortgage-backedsecurities is estimated considering the value of the collateral (in this case, the commercialmortgage loans from which the cash flows on the securities are derived) and the specific attributesof the securities held by the Firm. The value of the collateral pool supporting the securities areanalyzed using the same techniques and factors described above, for the valuation of commercial mortgage loans albeit in a more aggregated manneracross the pool. For example, average delinquencies, loan or geographic concentrations and averagedebt-service coverage ratios, among other metrics, may be evaluated. In addition, as eachsecuritization vehicle distributes cash in a manner or order that is predetermined at the inceptionof the vehicle, the order in which each particular mortgage-backed security is allocated, cashflows and the level of credit enhancement in place to support those cash flows are keyconsiderations in deriving the value of the mortgage-backed securities. Finally, the risk premiumthat investors demand for securitized products in today's market is factored into the valuation. Tobenchmark its valuations, the Firm utilizes106 Table of Contentsindependent pricing provided by third-party vendors, and broker quotes, as applicable. While noneof those sources are solely indicative of fair value, they serve as directional indicators for theappropriateness of the Firm's estimates.The following table presents mortgage-related activities within the available-for-sale securitiesportfolio.Exposures in the table above include $107.2&nbsp;billion of mortgage-backed securities classified asavailable-for-sale in the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008.These investments are used as part of the Firm's centralized riskmanagement of structural interest rate risk (the sensitivity of theFirm's aggregate balance sheet to changes in interest rates). Changes in the Firm's structuralinterest rate position, as well as changes in the overall interest rate environment, arecontinually monitored resulting in periodic repositioning of this portfolio. Given that thisportfolio is primarily used to manage interest rate risk, predominantly all of these securities arebacked by either U.S. government agencies, government sponsoredentities, or are rated AAA.Investmentsecurities in the available-for-sale portfolio include:Credit adjustmentsWhen determining the fair value of an instrument it may be necessary to record a valuationadjustment to arrive at an exit price in accordance with SFAS 157. Valuation adjustments include, butare not limited to, amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the Firm's owncreditworthiness. See also Note 4 on page 111 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report for adiscussion of the valuation adjustments the Firm may take to arrive at a fair value measurement.107 Table of ContentsCreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;)The fair value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment, the CVA, to reflect the creditquality of counterparties. These adjustments are necessary when the market price or marketparameter is not indicative of the credit quality of the counterparty. As few classes of derivativecontracts are listed on an exchange, the majority of derivative positions are valued usinginternally developed models that use as their basis observable market parameters. Market practiceis to quote market parameters equivalent to an &#147;AA&#148; credit rating; thus, all counterparties areassumed to have the same credit quality. Therefore, an adjustment to the valuation arrived at usingsuch observable parameters is necessary in order to reflect the actual credit quality of eachderivative counterparty when calculating the fair value of the instrument. The adjustment alsotakes into account contractual factors designed to reduce the Firm's credit exposure to eachcounterparty, such as collateral and legal rights of offset.DebitValuation Adjustment (&#147;DVA&#148;)Beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Firm began factoring an estimate of its own creditworthiness(i.e., DVA) into the valuation of financial liabilities that are carried atfair value in accordance with SFAS 157. The methodology to determine the adjustment is consistentwith CVA and incorporates JPMorgan Chase's credit spread as observed in the credit default swapmarket. The market's view of the credit quality of the Firm, as reflected in quoted spreads in thecredit default swap market, is driven by a number of factors, including the quality and performanceof the assets held by the Firm. The liabilities carried at fair value and for which a DVAadjustment is taken include derivative contracts and structured notes.On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Firm elected under SFAS 159 to record at fair value all structured notesnot previously elected or eligible for election under SFAS 155. As a result, all structured notesare measured on a fair value basis. For further information on these elections, see Note 4 on pages109&#151;111 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. Structured notes are debt instruments withembedded derivatives that are tailored to meet a client need for derivative risk in a funded form.The derivative is the primary driver of the risk and as such the valuation of structured notes issimilar to that of a derivative and includes a DVA to reflect the credit quality of the Firm.The following table provides the credit adjustments (both CVA and DVA) as reflected within theConsolidated Balance Sheets of the Firm as of the dates indicated.&nbsp;The following table provides the impact of credit adjustments (CVA and DVA) on earnings in therespective periods.&nbsp;As noted above, the market's view of the Firm's credit quality is reflected in credit spreadsobserved in the credit default swap market. These credit spreads are affected by a number offactors such as the performance of the assets the Firm holds. Consequently, significantdeterioration in the value of sizable exposures held by the Firm, are likely to result in widercredit default swap spreads. This will lead to an increase in the Firm's credit adjustment (i.e.,DVA) for liabilities108 Table of Contentscarried at fair value. Two examples of sizable exposures that have experienced a significantdeterioration in value are leveraged loans and mortgages carried at fair value. The impact on thevalue of these assets for three and nine months endedSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008, was $3.6&nbsp;billion and $7.5billion, respectively.NOTE 4 &#151; FAIR VALUE OPTIONSFAS 159 provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selectedfinancial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loancommitments not previously carried at fair value. The Firm's fair value elections were intended tomitigate the volatility in earnings that had been created by recording financial instruments andthe related risk management instruments on a different basis of accounting or to eliminate theoperational complexities of applying hedge accounting.For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which fair value elections were made andthe basis for those elections, see Note 5 on pages 119&#151;121 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.2008 ElectionsDuring 2008, the following elections were made:Changes in value under the fair value option electionThe following tables present the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements ofIncome for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, for items for which thefair value election was made. The profit and loss information presented below only includes thefinancial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk managementinstruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.109 Table of Contents&nbsp;110 Table of ContentsDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which a fair value election wasmadeThe following describes how the gains and losses included in earnings during the quarters endedSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, which were attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk,were determined.Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balanceoutstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregateremaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31,2007, for loans and long-term debt for which the SFAS 159 fair value option has been elected. Theloans were classified in trading assets &#151; debt and equity instruments or in loans.&nbsp;The contractual amount of unfunded lending-related commitments for which the fair value optionwas elected was negligible at September&nbsp;30, 2008. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, the contractual amount ofunfunded lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $1.0&nbsp;billionwith a corresponding fair value of $25&nbsp;million. Such commitments are reflected as liabilities andincluded in accounts payable, accrued expense and other liabilities.NOTE 5 &#151; PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS Principal transactions revenue consists of realized and unrealized gains and losses from tradingactivities (including physical commodities inventories that are accounted for at the lower of costor fair value), changes in fair value associated with financial instruments held by the InvestmentBank (&#147;IB&#148;) for which the SFAS 159 fair value option was111 Table of Contentselected, and loans held-for-sale within the wholesale lines of business. Principal transactionsrevenue also includes private equity gains and losses.The following table presents principal transactions revenue.&nbsp;Trading assets and liabilitiesTrading assets include debt and equity instruments held for trading purposes that JPMorgan Chaseowns (&#147;long&#148; positions), certain loans for which the Firm manages on a fair value basis and haselected the SFAS 159 fair value option, and physical commodities inventories that are accountedfor at the lower of cost or fair value. Trading liabilities include debt and equity instrumentsthat the Firm has sold to other parties but does not own (&#147;short&#148; positions). The Firm isobligated to purchase instruments at a future date to cover the short positions. Included intrading assets and trading liabilities are the reported receivables (unrealized gains) andpayables (unrealized losses) related to derivatives. Trading positions are carried at fair valueon the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For a discussion of the valuation of trading assets andtrading liabilities, see Note 4 on pages 111&#151;118 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.The following table presents the fair value of trading assets and trading liabilities for thedates indicated.112 Table of Contents&nbsp;Average trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.&nbsp;Private equityPrivate equity investments are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Thefollowing table presents the carrying value and cost of the private equity investment portfolioheld by the Private Equity business within Corporate/Private Equity for the dates indicated.Private equity includes investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. Theseinvestments are accounted for under investment company guidelines. Accordingly, these investments,irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interest held, are carried on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheets at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes invalue are reported in principal transactions revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income inthe period that the gains or losses occur.

These amounts included an accrual for theestimated cost of stock awards to be granted to full career eligible employees of $159&nbsp;million and$123&nbsp;million for the quarters ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $433&nbsp;million and$380&nbsp;million for the first nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.In the first quarter of 2008, the Firm granted 64&nbsp;million restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) to JPMorgan Chase employees with agrant date fair value of $39.83 per RSU in connection with its annual incentive grant.In connection with the Bear Stearns merger, 46&nbsp;million Bear Stearns employee stock awards,principally RSUs, capital appreciation plan units and stock options,were exchanged for equivalent JPMorgan Chase awards using the merger exchange ratio of 0.21753. Thefair value of these employee stock awards was included in the purchase price since substantiallyall of the awards were fully vested immediately after the merger date under provisions thatprovided for accelerated vesting upon a change of control of Bear Stearns. However, Bear Stearnsvested employee stock options had no impact on the purchase price; since the employee stock optionswere significantly out of the money at the merger date, the fair value of these awards was equal tozero upon their conversion into JPMorgan Chase options.The Firm also exchanged 6&nbsp;million shares of its common stock for 27&nbsp;million shares of Bear Stearnscommon stock held in an irrevocable grantor trust (the &#147;RSU Trust&#148;) using the merger exchange ratioof 0.21753. The RSU Trust was established to hold common stock underlying awards granted toselected employees and key executives under certain Bear Stearns employee stock plans. The RSUTrust was consolidated on JPMorgan Chase's Consolidated BalanceSheets as of June&nbsp;30, 2008, and theshares held in the RSU Trust were recorded in &#147;Shares held in RSU Trust,&#148; which reducedstockholders' equity, similar to the treatment for treasury stock. A related obligation to issuestock under these employee stock plans is reported in capital surplus. The issuance of shares heldin the RSU Trust to employees will not have any effect on the Firm's total stockholders' equity,net income or earnings per share.In June&nbsp;2008, the Firm granted 19&nbsp;million RSUs with a grant date fair value of $42.22 per RSU toretain certain Bear Stearns employees. Substantially all of these awards were granted with the sameterms and conditions as described in Note 10 on page 131 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.116 Table of ContentsNOTE 10 &#151; NONINTEREST EXPENSEMerger costsCosts associated with the Bear Stearns merger in 2008, costs associated with the 2004 merger withBank One Corporation, and costs associated with The Bank of New York, Inc. transaction (&#147;The Bankof New York&#148;) are reflected in the merger costs caption of the Consolidated Statements of Income.Costs related to the Washington Mutual transaction for the three andnine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 were not material.For a further discussion of the Bear Stearns merger, see Note 2 on pages 95&#151;98 of this Form 10-Q.A summary of merger-related costs is shown in the following table.&nbsp;The table below shows the change in the merger reserve balance related to the costsassociated with the mergers.&nbsp;NOTE 11 &#151; SECURITIESFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities, see Note 12 on pages 134&#151;136 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.

Potentialother-than-temporary impairment ofAFS securities is considered using a variety of factors, including the length of time and extent towhich the market value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near-term prospects ofthe issuer or underlying collateral of a security and the Firm's intent and ability to retain thesecurity in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Where applicable under EITFIssue 99-20, the Firm estimates the cash flows over the life of the security to determine if anyadverse changes have occurred that require an other-than-temporary impairment charge. The Firmapplies EITF Issue 99-20 to beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below AA atacquisition or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firmwould not recover substantially all of its recorded investment. The Firm considers a decline infair value to be other-than-temporary if it is probable that the Firm will not recover its recordedinvestment, including as applicable under EITF Issue 99-20, when an adverse change in cash flowshas occurred.The Firm's analysis of impairment includes an examination of the issuer's financial condition, theunderlying credit quality of the issuer or underlying collateral and other performance indicatorsrelevant to the specific investment. For asset-backed investments, such relevant performanceindicators may include ratings, valuation of subordinated positions in current and/or stressscenarios, excess spread or overcollateralization levels, and whether certain protective triggershave been reached. For mortgage-backed investments, such relevant performance indicators mayinclude ratings, prepayment speeds, delinquencies, default rates, loss severities, geographicconcentration, and forecasted performance under various home price decline stress scenarios.118 Table of ContentsApproximately$2.3&nbsp;billion of the unrealized losses as of September&nbsp;30,2008, have not existed for longer than 12months, and primarily relate to U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities,prime mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and credit card collateralizedsecurities. The prime mortgage-backed securities and collateralized loan obligations are primarilyrated AAA while the credit card collateralized securities include AAA, A and BBB ratings. Thesesecurities are subjected to the analyses described above, which indicate that the unrealized lossesresult from liquidity conditions in the current market environment and not from concerns regardingthe credit of the issuers or underlying collateral. The Firm does not believe it is probable thatit will not recover its investments given the current levels of collateral and credit enhancementsthat exist to protect the investments.The Firm intends to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position for a period of timesufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, or to their contractual maturities.The Firm has sufficient capital and liquidity to be able to hold these securities until recovery ormaturity. Based on the Firm's evaluation of the factors and other objective evidence describedabove, the Firm believes that the securities are not other-than-temporarily impaired as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008.NOTE 12 &#151; SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIESFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 onpage 136 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are generally treated as collateralized financingtransactions and carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts the securities will besubsequently sold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Securities borrowed and securities lent,also treated as collateral financing transactions, are generally recorded at the amount of cashcollateral advanced or received.On January&nbsp;1, 2007, pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 159, the Firm elected fair value measurementfor certain resale and repurchase agreements. In the second quarter of 2008, the Firm elected fairvalue measurement for certain newly transacted securities borrowed and securities lendingagreements. For a further discussion of SFAS 159, see Note 4 on pages 109&#151;111 of this Form 10-Q.The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected continue to bereported within securities purchased under resale agreements; securities loaned or sold underrepurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and other borrowed funds on the Consolidated BalanceSheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current period interest accruals arerecorded within interest income and interest expense with changes in fair value reported inprincipal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivativesthat would be separately accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133, all changes in fair value,including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.Securities financing transactions that meet the criteria within FIN 41 are reported on a net basis.The following table details the components of collateralized agreements, and collateralizedfinancings at each of the dates indicated.&nbsp;119 Table of ContentsJPMorgan Chase pledges certain financial instruments it owns to collateralize repurchaseagreements and other securities financings. Pledged securities that can be sold or repledged by thesecured party are identified as financial instruments owned (pledged to various parties) on theConsolidated Balance Sheets.At September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm received securities as collateral that could be repledged,delivered or otherwise used with a fair value of approximately $603.8&nbsp;billion. This collateral wasgenerally obtained under resale or securities borrowing agreements. Of these securities,approximately $492.3&nbsp;billion were repledged, delivered or otherwise used, generally as collateralunder repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements or to cover short sales.NOTE 13 &#151; LOANSThe accounting for a loan may differ based upon whether it is originated or purchased and onwhether it is used in an investing or trading strategy. For purchasedloans held for investment, the accounting alsodiffers depending on whether a loan is credit impaired at the date of acquisition. Loans withevidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that allcontractually required payments receivable will not be collected are considered to be creditimpaired. The measurement framework for loans in the consolidated financial statements is one ofthe following:For a detailed discussion of accounting policies relating to loans, see Note 14 on pages 137&#151;138of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. See Note 4 on pages 109&#151;111 of this Form 10-Q for furtherinformation on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under SFAS 159. See Note 5 on pages111&#151;113 of this Form 10-Q for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified astrading assets.Interest income is recognized using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rateof return over the term of the loan.Loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred tothe held-for-sale portfolio. Transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fairvalue on the date of transfer. Losses attributed to credit losses are charged off to the allowancefor loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates, or exchange rates, are recognized innoninterest revenue.Loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to theheld-for-investment portfolio at fair value. The allowance for loan losses for such loans is basedupon the Firm's allowance methodology. For a further discussion of the methodologies used inestablishing the Firm's allowance for loans losses, see Note 15 on page 138 of JPMorgan Chase's2007 Annual Report.In connection with the Washington Mutual transaction, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain loans that itdeemed to be credit impaired under SOP 03-3. Wholesale loans were generally determined to be creditimpaired if Washington Mutual had previously accounted for them as impaired loans under SFAS 114.Consumer loans were preliminarily determined to be credit impaired based upon specific riskcharacteristics of the loan, including delinquency status, geographic location, loan-to-valueratios and product type.SOP 03-3 allows purchasers to aggregate credit impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarterinto one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is thenaccounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectationof cash flows. With respect to the Washington Mutual transaction, all of the consumer loans arebeing aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics, while wholesale loans arebeing accounted for individually.At September&nbsp;30, 2008, the preliminary estimate of the contractually required payments receivable for these loans were $108.8 billion, thecash flows expected to be collected were $148.1 billion, including $68.9 billion of interest, and the estimated fair value of the loans was $78.1 billion.Each of the preceding amounts was120 Table of Contentsdetermined based upon the estimated remaining life of the underlying loans, which include theeffects of estimated prepayments. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, $272 million of these loans were classifiedas nonperforming assets; interest income is expected to be recognizedon the remaining $77.8 billionof loans. Due to the short time period between the closing of thetransaction (which occurred simultaneously with the announcement onSeptember&nbsp;25, 2008) and the end of the third quarter, certainamounts related to the purchased credit impaired loans disclosedherein are preliminary estimates. The Firm expects to finalize itsanalysis of these purchased credit impaired loans during the fourthquarter of 2008; expanded disclosures will be provided at that timeand adjustments to estimated amounts may occur.The composition of the loan portfolio at each of the dates indicated was as follows.&nbsp;The following table reflects information about the Firm's loan sales.&nbsp;121 Table of ContentsImpaired loansA loan is considered impaired when, based upon current information and events, it is probablethat the Firm will be unable to collect all amounts due (including principal and interest)according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans include certainnonaccrual wholesale loans and loans for which a charge-off has been recorded based upon the fairvalue of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans also include loans that have been modified introubled debt restructurings as a concession to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.Troubled debt restructurings typically result from the Firm's loss mitigation activities and couldinclude rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance and other actions intended to minimizethe economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Purchased creditimpaired loans are not required to be reported as impaired loans as long as they continue toperform at least as well as expected at acquisition. Accordingly, none of the credit impairedloans acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction are reported in the following tables.The tables below set forth information about JPMorgan Chase's impaired loans, excluding credit card loans which are discussed below. The Firm primarily uses the discounted cash flowmethod for valuing impaired loans.&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase may modify the terms of its credit card loan agreements with borrowers who haveexperienced financial difficulty. Such modifications may include: canceling the customer'savailable line of credit on the credit card, reducing the interest rate on the card, and placingthe customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60&nbsp;months. If the cardholder does not complywith the modified terms, then the credit card loan agreement will revert back to its originalterms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency &#147;bucket&#148;and the loan amounts then charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.Under these programs, $2.0&nbsp;billion and $1.4&nbsp;billion of on-balance sheet credit card loanoutstandings have been modified at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. Inaccordance with the Firm's methodology for determining its consumer allowance for loan losses, theFirm had already provisioned for these credit card loans; the modifications to these credit cardloans had no incremental impact on the Firm's allowance for loan losses.122 Table of ContentsNOTE 14 &#151; ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESFor a further discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies,see Note 15 on pages 138&#151;139 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The table below summarizesthe changes in the allowance for loan losses.&nbsp;The table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for lending-related commitments.123 Table of ContentsNOTE15 &#151; ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OTHER ASSETS, AND ACCOUNTSPAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSE AND OTHER LIABILITIESThe following table details the components of accrued interest and accounts receivable, otherassets, and accounts payable, accrued expense and other liabilities at each of the dates indicated.&nbsp;NOTE 16 &#151; LOAN SECURITIZATIONSJPMorgan Chase securitizes and sells a variety of its consumer and wholesale loans, includingwarehouse loans that are classified as trading assets. JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitizationsutilize special purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) as part of the securitization process. These SPEs arestructured to meet the definition of a qualifying special purpose entity (&#147;QSPE&#148;) (for a furtherdiscussion, see Note 1 on page 108 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report); accordingly, the assetsand liabilities of securitization-related QSPEs are not reflected in the Firm's ConsolidatedBalance Sheets (except for retained interests, as described below) but are included on the balancesheet of the QSPE purchasing the assets. The primary purpose of these vehicles is to meet investorneeds and to generate liquidity for the Firm through the sale of loans to the QSPEs.Consumer activities include securitization of credit card, residential mortgage, automobile andeducation loans that are originated or purchased by Retail Financial Services (&#147;RFS&#148;) and CardServices (&#147;CS&#148;). CS retains servicing for all its originated credit card loans. It also has anundivided interest in its credit card master trusts and other retained senior and subordinatedinterests. RFS retains servicing for all of its originated and purchased mortgage, automobile andeducation loans and may retain servicing for certain mortgage loans purchased by the IB. In alimited number of securitizations, RFS may retain a residual interest.124 Table of ContentsWholesale activities include IB securitizations of purchased residential mortgage loans, certainmortgage loans originated by RFS and commercial loans (primarily real estate-related) originated bythe IB. Residential mortgages securitized by the IB are either serviced by RFS, third parties or bythe IB. The IB mayretain a residual interest in residential mortgage and non-mortgage consumer loans. The IB does notgenerally retain a residual interest in the Firm's sponsored commercial mortgage securitizations.See pages 106&#151;107 of this Form 10-Q for further details on the Firm's retained interests insecuritized loans.Assets held by JPMorgan Chase-sponsored securitization-related QSPEs as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2007, were as follows.&nbsp;Total assets in the above table includes securitized loans where the Firm has no continuinginvolvement, predominantly commercial mortgages, as well as securitized loans where the Firm's onlycontinuing involvement is servicing the loans. The table also includes securitized loans where theFirm owns less than a majority of the subordinated or residual interests in the securitizations.See pages 106&#151;107 for further details on the Firm's retained interests in securitized loans.The following tables summarize new securitization transactions that were completed during the threeand nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007; the resulting gains arising from suchsecuritizations; certain cash flows received from such securitizations; and the key economicassumptions used in measuring the retained interests (if any) other than residential MSRs (for adiscussion of residential MSRs, see Note 18 on pages 135&#151;137 of this Form 10-Q) as of the dates ofsuch sales.125 Table of Contents&nbsp;126 Table of ContentsIn addition to the amounts reported for securitization activity in the preceding tables, theFirm sold residential mortgage loans totaling $31.9&nbsp;billion and $21.5&nbsp;billion during the threemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily for securitization by theGovernment National Mortgage Association (&#147;GNMA&#148;), FederalNational Mortgage Association (&#147;FannieMae&#148;) and Federal Home Loan MortgageCorporation (&#147;Freddie Mac&#148;); these sales resulted in pretax gains (losses)&nbsp;of $4&nbsp;million and $(20)million, respectively. During the first nine months of 2008 and 2007, JPMorgan Chase soldresidential mortgage loans totaling $101.0&nbsp;billion and $57.3&nbsp;billion, respectively, primarily forsecuritization by the GNMA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac; these sales resulted in pretax gains of$30&nbsp;million and $67&nbsp;million, respectively.Retained servicingJPMorgan Chase retains servicing responsibilities for all originated, and certain purchased,residential mortgage, credit card, education and automobile loan securitizations and for certaincommercial activity securitizations it sponsors, and receives servicing fees based upon thesecuritized loan balance plus certain ancillary fees. The Firm also retains the right to servicethe residential mortgage loans it sells to GNMA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in accordance withtheir servicing guidelines and standards. For a discussion of mortgage servicing rights, see Note18 on pages 135&#151;137 of this Form 10-Q.Retained securitization interestsAt September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Firm had, with respect to its credit card mastertrusts, $29.4&nbsp;billion and $18.6&nbsp;billion, respectively, related to undivided interests, and $3.4billion and $2.7&nbsp;billion, respectively, related to subordinated interests in accrued interest andfees on the securitized receivables, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts. Credit cardsecuritization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest of 4% to 12% of theprincipal receivables in the trusts. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principalreceivables in the trusts of approximately 21% for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, and19% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007.The Firm also maintains escrow accounts up to predetermined limits for some credit card, automobileand education securitizations to cover the unlikely event of deficiencies in cash flows owed toinvestors. The amounts available in such escrow accounts are recorded in other assets and, as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008, amounted to $47&nbsp;million, $9&nbsp;million and $3&nbsp;million for credit card, automobileand education securitizations, respectively; as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, these amounts were $97million, $21&nbsp;million and $3&nbsp;million for credit card, automobile and education securitizations,respectively.The following table summarizes other retained securitization interests, and are carried at fairvalue on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.&nbsp;127 Table of ContentsThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's retained interests other than residential MSRs (for a discussion of residential MSRs, seeNote 18 on pages 135&#151;137 of this Form 10-Q) in its securitization trusts at September&nbsp;30, 2008,and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively; in addition, it outlines the sensitivities of those fairvalues to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.&nbsp;The sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical. Changes in fair value basedupon a 10% or 20% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated easily because therelationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,in the table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value iscalculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result inchanges in another, which might counteract or magnify the sensitivities. The above sensitivities donot reflect the Firm's risk management practices that may be undertaken to mitigate such risks.128 Table of ContentsThe table below presents information about delinquencies, net charge-offs (recoveries)&nbsp;andcomponents of reported and securitized financial assets at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31,2007.&nbsp;129 Table of ContentsSubprime adjustable-rate mortgage loan modificationsIn December&nbsp;2007, the American Securitization Forum (&#147;ASF&#148;) issued the &#147;StreamlinedForeclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for Securitized Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans&#148;(the &#147;Framework&#148;). For a further discussion of the ASF Framework, see Note 16 on page 145 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.JPMorgan Chase has adopted the loss mitigation approaches under the Framework for securitizedsubprime mortgage loans that meet the specific Segment 2 screening criteria, and began modifyingSegment 2 loans during the first quarter of 2008. The adoption of the Framework did not affect theoff-balance sheet accounting treatment of JPMorgan Chase-sponsored QSPEs that hold Segment 2subprime loans.The total amount of assets owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs that hold ASF Framework Loans (includingthose loans that are not serviced by the Firm) as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,were as follows including the impact of the Washington Mutual acquisition.Of theamounts presented above, $15.4&nbsp;billion and $9.7&nbsp;billion, respectively, are related toASF Framework Loans serviced by the Firm. The following table presents the portion of ASFFramework Loans, serviced by the Firm, that are owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs that fell withinSegments 1, 2 and 3 as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.The estimates of segment classification could change substantially as a result ofunanticipated changes in housing values, economic conditions, borrower/investor behavior and otherfactors.Included within the assets owned by the Firm-sponsored QSPEs was repossessed real estate owned, forwhich JPMorgan Chase is the servicer, in the amount of $4.3&nbsp;billion and $637&nbsp;million at September30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. The growth in real estate owned in the third quarterof 2008 is attributable to the Washington Mutual transaction and increased foreclosures resultingfrom current housing market conditions.For those ASF Framework Loans serviced by the Firm and owned by Firm-sponsored QSPEs, the Firmmodified $155&nbsp;million and $991&nbsp;million, respectively, of Segment 2 subprime mortgages during thethree and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008. For Segment 3 loans, an appropriate loss mitigationapproach that is intended to maximize the recoveries to the securitization trust is chosen withoutemploying the fast track modifications prescribed for Segment 2 subprime mortgages. The lossmitigation approach chosen by JPMorgan Chase is consistent with the applicable servicing agreementsand could include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, forbearance and other actions intended tominimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure. The table below presents selected informationrelating to Segment 3 loans for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008.The impact of loss mitigation efforts on the fair value of the Firm's retained interests inASF Framework loans was not material at September&nbsp;30, 2008.130 Table of ContentsNOTE 17 &#151; VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESRefer to Note 1 on page 108 and Note 17 on page 146 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report fora further description of JPMorgan Chase's policies regarding consolidation of variable interestentities and the Firm's principal involvement with variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;).Multi-seller conduitsThe following table summarizes the Firm's involvement with nonconsolidated Firm-administered,multi-seller conduits. There were no consolidated Firm-administered, multi-seller conduits as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.&nbsp;Assets funded by the multi-seller conduitsJPMorgan Chase's administered multi-seller conduits fund a variety of asset types for the Firm'sclients. Asset types primarily include credit card receivables, auto loans and leases, tradereceivables, education loans, commercial loans, residential mortgages, capital commitments (e.g.,loans to private equity, mezzanine and real estate opportunity funds secured by capital commitmentsof highly rated institutional investors), and various other asset types. It is the Firm's intentionthat the assets funded by its administered multi-seller conduits be sourced only from the Firm'sclients and not be originated by, or transferred from, JPMorgan Chase.The following table presents information on the commitments and assets held by JPMorgan Chase'sadministered multi-seller conduits as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.131 Table of Contents&nbsp;The assets held by the multi-seller conduits are structured so that if they were rated, theFirm believes the majority of them would receive an &#147;A&#148; rating or better by external ratingagencies. However, it is unusual for the assets held by the conduits to be explicitly rated by anexternal rating agency. Instead, the Firm's Credit Risk group assigns each asset purchase liquidityfacility an internal risk-rating based upon its assessment of the probability of default for thetransaction. The ratings provided in the above table reflect the S&P-equivalent ratings of theinternal rating grades assigned by the Firm.The risk ratings are periodically reassessed as information becomes available. As of September&nbsp;30,2008, 92% of the assets in the conduits were risk rated &#147;A&#148; or better.Commercial paper issued by the multi-seller conduitsThe weighted average life of commercial paper issued by the multi-seller conduits was 18&nbsp;days atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008, compared with 21&nbsp;days at December&nbsp;31, 2007, and the average yield on thecommercial paper was 3.0% at September&nbsp;30, 2008, compared with 5.7% at December&nbsp;31, 2007.In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase trades and invests in commercial paper, includingpaper issued by the Firm-administered conduits. The percentage of commercial paper purchased by theFirm across all Firm-administered conduits during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, rangedfrom less than 1% to 12.1% on any given day. The largest daily amount held by the Firm in any onemulti-seller conduit during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, was approximately $2.5billion, or 21.3%, of the conduit's commercial paper outstanding. Total commercial paper held bythe Firm at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, was $2.8&nbsp;billion and $131&nbsp;million,respectively.Inaddition, beginning September&nbsp;19, 2008, with the Federal Reserve's establishment of the AMLFacility, JPMorgan Chase purchased highquality asset-backed commercial paper from eligible U.S. money marketmutual funds and used the commercial paper purchased to securenonrecourse advances received from the FRBB. Commercialpaper purchased through the AML Facility may include paper issued by the Firm-administered conduits.However, the Firm does not bear any credit or market risk related to the commercial paper heldunder the AML Facility and is not assessed any regulatory capital. Commercial paperpurchased and held through the AML Facility by the Firm at September30, 2008, totaled $2.8&nbsp;billion.132 Table of ContentsThe Firm is not obligated under any agreement (contractual or noncontractual) to purchase thecommercial paper issued by JPMorgan Chase-administered conduits.Consolidated sensitivity analysis on capitalIt is possible that the Firm could be required to consolidate a VIE if it were determined that theFirm became the primary beneficiary of the VIE under the provisions of FIN 46R. The factorsinvolved in making the determination of whether or not a VIE should be consolidated are discussedin Note 1 on page 108 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.The table below shows the impact on the Firm's reported assets, liabilities, net income, Tier 1capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio if the Firm were required to consolidate all of themulti-seller conduits that it administers.&nbsp;The Firm could fund purchases of assets from VIEs should it become necessary.Investor intermediationMunicipal bond vehiclesExposure to nonconsolidated municipal bond VIEs at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,including the ratings profile of the VIE's assets, were as follows.&nbsp;133 Table of ContentsAt September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Firm held $1.7&nbsp;billion and $617&nbsp;million,respectively, of putable floating-rate certificates on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The largestamount held by the Firm at any time during the first nine months of 2008 was $2.2&nbsp;billion, or11.3%, of the municipal bond vehicles' outstanding putable floating-rate certificates.At both September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, 99% of the municipal bonds held by vehicles towhich the Firm served as liquidity provider were rated &#147;AA-&#148; or better, based upon either therating of the underlying municipal bond itself, or the rating including any credit enhancement. AtSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, $4.6&nbsp;billion and $12.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, of thebonds were insured by monoline bond insurers. During the first nine months of 2008 and full-year2007, the Firm did not experience a draw on the liquidity facilities. In addition, the municipalbond vehicles did not experience any bankruptcy or downgrade termination events during the firstnine months of 2008 and full-year 2007.The Firm sometimes invests in the residual interests of municipal bond vehicles. For VIEs in whichthe Firm owns the residual interests, the Firm consolidates the VIEs. The likelihood that the Firmwould have to consolidate VIEs where the Firm does not own the residual interests and that arecurrently off-balance sheet is remote.Credit-linked note vehiclesExposure to nonconsolidated credit-linked note VIEs at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,was as follows.&nbsp;Collateralized Debt Obligations vehiclesExposures to collateralized debt obligation (&#147;CDO&#148;) warehouse VIEs at September&nbsp;30, 2008, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2007, were as follows.&nbsp;134 Table of ContentsIn addition to the CDO warehouse exposure noted above, at September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm had noconsolidated CDO vehicles, as it did not own a majority of the equity interest in such vehicles.The Firm also owned less than majority equity interests in several CDO vehicles for which the Firmwas not the primary beneficiary and, therefore, did not consolidate the entities. The fair value ofthese interests was $2&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2008. These nonconsolidated CDO vehicles had totalassets of approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2008, all of which were noninvestment-grade.Other significant interests in VIEsIn conjunction with the Bear Stearns merger, in June&nbsp;2008, the FRBNY took control, through an LLCformed for this purpose, of a portfolio of $30&nbsp;billion in assets, based upon the value of theportfolio as of March&nbsp;14, 2008. The assets of the LLC were funded by a $28.85&nbsp;billion, term loanfrom the FRBNY, and a $1.15&nbsp;billion, subordinated loan from JPMorgan Chase. The JPMorgan Chase loanis subordinated to the FRBNY loan and will bear the first $1.15&nbsp;billion of any losses of theportfolio. Any remaining assets in the portfolio after repayment of the FRBNY loan, the JPMorganChase loan and the expense of the LLC, will be for the account of the FRBNY.Consolidated VIE assetsThe following table summarizes the Firm's total consolidated VIE assets, by classification, on theConsolidated Balance Sheets, as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.&nbsp;The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs areclassified in the line item titled, &#147;Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interestentities&#148; on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The holders of these beneficial interests do not haverecourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. See Note 21 on page 159 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007Annual Report for the maturity profile of FIN 46R long-term beneficial interests.NOTE 18 &#151; GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSFor a discussion of accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note18 on pages 154&#151;157 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Goodwill and other intangible assets consist of the following.GoodwillThe $851&nbsp;million increase in goodwill from December&nbsp;31, 2007, largely resulted from the purchase ofan additional equity interest in Highbridge, tax-related purchase accounting adjustments associatedwith the Bank One merger and the merger with Bear Stearns. For additional information, see Note 2on pages 93&#151;98 of this Form 10-Q.Goodwill was not impaired at September&nbsp;30, 2008, or December&nbsp;31, 2007, nor was any goodwill writtenoff due to impairment during either the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 or 2007.135 Table of ContentsGoodwill attributed to the business segments was as follows.Mortgage servicing rightsFor a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and valuationmethodology of MSRs, see Notes 4 and 18 on pages 113 and 154&#151;157 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport, respectively. The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, includingtheir effect on prepayment speeds. JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of derivatives and tradinginstruments to manage changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any changes in thefair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments. MSRsdecrease in value when interest rates decline. Conversely, securities (such as mortgage-backedsecurities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (when the Firm receives fixed-rateinterest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline.The following tables summarize MSR activity for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008and 2007.&nbsp;The table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of theFirm's MSRs at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively; and it outlines thesensitivities of those fair values to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those assumptions.CPR: Constant prepayment rate136 Table of ContentsThe sensitivity analysis in the preceding table is hypothetical and should be used withcaution. Changes in fair value based upon a 10% and 20% variation in assumptions generally cannotbe easily extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change infair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect that a change in a particularassumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. Inreality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteractthe sensitivities.Purchased credit card relationships and all other intangible assetsFor the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, purchased credit card relationships, other creditcard-related intangibles and core deposit intangibles decreased $869&nbsp;million, predominantly as aresult of amortization expense. Other intangibles (net of amortization) increased $250&nbsp;million,primarily as a result of the purchase of an additional equity interest in Highbridge as well as theacquisition of an institutional global custody portfolio.Except for $517&nbsp;million of indefinite-lived intangibles related to asset management advisorycontracts which are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, theremainder of the Firm's other acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization.The components of credit card relationships, core deposits and other intangible assets were asfollows.&nbsp;Amortization expenseThe following table presents amortization expense related to credit card relationships, coredeposits and all other intangible assets.The following table presents estimated future amortization expense related to credit cardrelationships, core deposits and all other intangible assets at September&nbsp;30, 2008.&nbsp;137 Table of ContentsNOTE 19 &#151; DEPOSITSAt September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing depositswere as follows.At September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, time deposits in denominations of $100,000 ormore were as follows.The maturities of time deposits in each of the 12-month periods ending September&nbsp;30, 2009,2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 was as follows.NOTE 20 &#151; OTHER BORROWED FUNDS Other borrowed funds consist of demand notes, term federal funds purchased andvarious other borrowings. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, JPMorgan Chase had no lines of credit for generalcorporate purposes.The following table details the components of other borrowed funds.&nbsp;138 Table of ContentsNOTE 21 &#151; LONG-TERM DEBTJPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in various currencies, although predominantly inU.S. dollars, with both fixed and variable interest rates. The following table is a summary oflong-term debt carrying values (including unamortized original issue discount, SFAS 133 valuationadjustments and fair value adjustments, where applicable) by contractual maturity for the currentyear.&nbsp;The weighted-average contractual interest rate for total long-term debt was 4.62% and 5.20% asof September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. In order to modify exposure to interestrate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments,primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of itsdebt issues. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm's interest expense on139 Table of Contentsthe associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rate for total long-term debt,including the effects of related derivative instruments, was 4.17% and 5.13% as of September&nbsp;30,2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Parent Company) has guaranteed certain debt of its subsidiaries, includingboth long-term debt and structured notes sold as part of the Firm's trading activities. Theseguarantees rank on a parity with all of the Firm's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.Guaranteed liabilities totaled $6.5&nbsp;billion and $4.7&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December31, 2007, respectively. Foradditional information, see Note 2 on pages 93&#151;98 of this Form 10-Q.Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issued guaranteed capitaldebt securitiesAt September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm had established 24 wholly-owned Delaware statutory business trusts(&#147;issuer trusts&#148;) that had issued guaranteed capital debt securities.The junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Firm to the issuer trusts,totaling $17.4&nbsp;billion and $15.1&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007,respectively, were reflected in the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets in the liabilities sectionunder the caption &#147;Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures held by trusts that issuedguaranteed capital debt securities&#148; (i.e., trust preferred capital debt securities). The Firm alsorecords the common capital securities issued by the issuer trusts in other assets in itsConsolidated Balance Sheets at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.The debentures issued to the issuer trusts by the Firm, less the common capital securities of theissuer trusts, qualify as Tier 1 capital. The following is a summary of the outstanding trustpreferred capital debt securities, including unamortized original issue discount, issued by eachtrust and the junior subordinated deferrable interest debenture issued to each trust as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2008.&nbsp;140 Table of ContentsNOTE 22 &#151; PREFERRED STOCKJPMorgan Chase is authorized to issue 200&nbsp;million shares of preferred stock, in one or more series,with a par value of $1 per share. On April&nbsp;23, 2008, the Firm issued 600,000 shares of Fixed toFloating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;I (&#147;Series&nbsp;I&#148;). On July&nbsp;15, 2008, each seriesof Bear Stearns' preferred stock issued and outstanding was exchanged into a series of JPMorganChase preferred stock having substantially identical terms. Prior to the exchange the Bear Stearns'preferred stock then outstanding was reported as a minority interestpayable for the Firm; as aresult of the exchange into JPMorgan Chase preferred stock, thesepreferred shares now rank pari passu with the otherseries of the Firm's preferred stock. On August&nbsp;21, 2008, the Firm issued 180,000 shares of 8.625%Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;J (&#147;Series&nbsp;J&#148;). JPMorgan Chase's preferred stock outstandingtakes precedence over the Firm's common stock for the payment of dividends and the distribution ofassets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Firm.Generally,dividends on shares of outstanding series of preferred stock are payable quarterly. Dividends on theshares of Series&nbsp;I preferred stock are payable semiannually at a fixed rate of 7.90% through April2018, and then become payable quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 3.47%.The following is a summary of JPMorgan Chase's preferred stock outstanding as of September&nbsp;30,2008.&nbsp;Pursuantto the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (the &#147;U.S.Treasury&#148;) Capital Purchase Program (the &#147;Capital PurchaseProgram&#148;),on October&nbsp;28, 2008, the Firm issued to the U.S. Treasury, in exchange for aggregate considerationof $25.0&nbsp;billion, (i)&nbsp;2.5&nbsp;million shares of theFirm's Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock,Series&nbsp;K, par value $1 and liquidation preference $10,000 pershare (and $25.0&nbsp;billion liquidationpreference in the aggregate) (the &#147;Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;a warrant (the &#147;Warrant&#148;).Dividends are payable quarterly on the Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock at a fixed rate of 5% for the first five years, and a fixed rate of 9% thereafter. The Series&nbsp;KPreferred Stock may be called or redeemed only under certain conditions. The Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock isnonvoting, qualifies as Tier&nbsp;1 capital and ranks on parity with the Firm's other series ofpreferred stock.Dividend restrictionsFor as long as any shares of Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividends may be declaredor paid on junior preferred shares, preferred shares ranking pari passu with the Series&nbsp;K PreferredStock, or common stock (other than in the case of pari passu preferred shares, dividends on a prorata basis with the Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock), unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for all pastdividend periods on the Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock are fully paid. The U.S. Treasury's consent isrequired for any increase in common dividends per share from the amount of the Firm's quarterlystock dividend of $0.38 per share, payable on October&nbsp;31, 2008 until the third anniversary of thepurchase agreement with the U.S. Treasury unless prior to such third anniversary theSeries&nbsp;K Preferred Stock is redeemed in whole or the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of theSeries&nbsp;K Preferred Stock to third parties.Stock repurchase restrictionsThe Firm may not repurchase or redeem any junior preferred shares, preferred shares ranking paripassu with the Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock or common stock without the prior consent of the U.S.Treasury (other than (i)&nbsp;repurchases of the Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock and (ii)&nbsp;repurchases of juniorpreferred shares or common stock in connection with any benefit141 Table of Contentsplan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) until the third anniversaryof the purchase agreement with the U.S. Treasury unless prior to such third anniversarythe Series&nbsp;K Preferred Stock is redeemed in whole or the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of theSeries&nbsp;K Preferred Stock to third parties.NOTE23 &#151; COMMON STOCKAt September&nbsp;30, 2008, JPMorgan Chase was authorized to issue 9.0&nbsp;billion shares of common stockwith a $1 par value per share. On September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm issued $11.5&nbsp;billion of new sharesof common stock at $40.50 per share, representing 284&nbsp;million shares.Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement dated March&nbsp;24, 2008 between JPMorgan Chase and BearStearns, 21&nbsp;million newly issued shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock were issued to Bear Stearnsin a transaction that was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant toSection&nbsp;4(2) thereof, in exchange for 95&nbsp;million newly issued shares of Bear Stearns common stock(or 39.5% of Bear Stearns common stock after giving effect to the issuance). Upon the consummationof the Bear Stearns merger, on May&nbsp;30, 2008, the 21&nbsp;million shares of JPMorgan Chase common stockand 95&nbsp;million shares of Bear Stearns common stock were cancelled. For a further discussion of thistransaction, see Note 2 on pages 95&#151;98 of this Form 10-Q.Common shares issued (newly issued or distributed from treasury) by JPMorgan Chase during the ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and 2007, were as follows:&nbsp;Pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program, the Firm issued to the U.S. Treasury a Warrant topurchase up to 88,401,697 shares of the Firm's common stock atan exercise price of $42.42 per share, subject to certain adjustments.On April&nbsp;17, 2007, the Firm's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program thatauthorizes the repurchase of up to $10.0&nbsp;billion of the Firm's common shares, which supersedes an$8.0&nbsp;billion stock repurchase program approved in 2006. The $10.0&nbsp;billion authorization includesshares to be repurchased to offset issuances under the Firm's employee stock-based plans. Theactual number of shares repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions;legal considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capitalposition (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation andalternative potential investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specificprice targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiatedtransactions, or utilizing Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 programs; and may be suspended at any time. During the ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm did not repurchase any shares of common stock. During thenine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2007, the Firm repurchased 165&nbsp;million shares of common stock understock repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors. For a discussion of restrictions onthe Firm's ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, the Firm's common stock, see Note 22 above.142 Table of ContentsNOTE 24 &#151; EARNINGS PER SHAREFor a discussion of the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;), see Note24 on page 161 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The following table presents thecalculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008 and2007.&nbsp;NOTE 25 &#151; ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;includes the after-tax change in SFAS 115unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, SFAS 52 foreign currency translation adjustments(including the impact of related derivatives), SFAS 133 cash flow hedging activities and SFAS158 net loss and prior service cost (credit)&nbsp;related to the Firm's defined benefit pension andOPEB plans.&nbsp;143 Table of ContentsNOTE 26 &#151; INCOME TAXESFor a discussion of income taxes, see Note 26 on pages 164-165 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport.JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits, the amount that would reduce the effective tax rate, ifrecognized, and related accrued interest expense and penalties were as follows at September&nbsp;30,2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.&nbsp;The increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would reduce the effective taxrate, if recognized, resulted predominantly from the merger with Bear Stearns in the second quarterof 2008. The increase in accrued income tax-related interest and penalties reflects the BearStearns merger and the continuing outstanding status of JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits.As JPMorgan Chase is presently under audit by a number of tax authorities, it is reasonablypossible that unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change over the next 12&nbsp;months, whichcould also significantly impact JPMorgan Chase's quarterly and annual effective tax rates.The Firm's income (loss)&nbsp;before income tax expense and extraordinary gain, income tax expense(benefit)&nbsp;and effective tax rate were as follows for each of the periods indicated.The change in the effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008,compared with the same periods for 2007, was the result of lower reported pretax income combinedwith an increased proportion of income that was not subject to U.S. federal income taxes, increasedtax credits, and the realization of a benefit from the release of deferred tax liabilitiesassociated with the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were deemed to bereinvested indefinitely, which is discussed below.JPMorgan Chase does not provide for U.S. federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings ofcertain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings are reinvested abroad for anindefinite period of time. During the third quarter of 2008, as part of JPMorgan Chase's periodicreview of the business requirements and capital needs of its non-U.S. subsidiaries, combined withthe formation of specific strategies and steps taken to fulfill these requirements and needs, theFirm determined that the undistributed earnings of certain of its subsidiaries, for which U.S.federal income taxes had been provided, will remain indefinitely reinvested to fund the current andfuture growth of the related businesses. As management does not intend to use the earnings of thesesubsidiaries as a source of funding for its U.S. operations, such earnings will not bedistributed to the U.S. in the foreseeable future. This determination resulted in the release ofdeferred tax liabilities and the recognition of an income tax benefit of $927&nbsp;million associatedwith these undistributed earnings. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2008, pretax earnings ofapproximately $2.1&nbsp;billion were generated that will remain indefinitely invested in thesesubsidiaries. At September&nbsp;30, 2008, the cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings inthese subsidiaries approximated $12.5&nbsp;billion. If the Firm were to record a deferred tax liabilityassociated with these undistributed earnings, the amount would be $2.6&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2008.144 Table of ContentsNOTE 27 &#151; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESFor a discussion of the Firm's potential liability related to The Bank of New York MellonCorporation's (&#147;BNYM&#148;) difficulties in locating certain documentation, including IRS Forms W-8 andW-9, related to certain accounts transferred to BNYM in connection with the Firm's sale of itscorporate trust business, see Note 29 on page 167 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report.Litigation reserveWhile the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, management believes, in light of allinformation known to it at September&nbsp;30, 2008, the Firm's litigation reserves were adequate at suchdate. Management reviews litigation reserves periodically, and the reserves may be increased ordecreased in the future to reflect further relevant developments. The Firm believes it hasmeritorious defenses to claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding litigation and,with respect to such litigation, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating orsettling cases according to management's judgment as to what is in the best interests ofstockholders.NOTE 28 &#151; ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESThe majority of JPMorgan Chase's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes. Derivativesare also utilized by the Firm as an end-user to hedge market exposures, to modify the interestrate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments or to meet longer-term investmentobjectives. Both trading and end-user derivatives are recorded in trading assets and tradingliabilities. The Firm did not expand or change its hedging strategies as a result of the BearStearns merger and Washington Mutual transaction. For a further discussion of the Firm's use ofand accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 30 on pages 168&#151;169 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The following table presents derivative instrumenthedging-related activities for the periods indicated.145 Table of Contents&nbsp;Over the next 12&nbsp;months, it is expected that $301&nbsp;million (after-tax) of net losses recordedin other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;at September&nbsp;30, 2008, will be recognized in earnings. Themaximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 10&nbsp;years, and suchtransactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.NOTE 29 &#151; OFF-BALANCE SHEET LENDING-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEESFor a discussion of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees, and theFirm's related accounting policies, see Note 31 on pages 170&#151;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 AnnualReport. To provide for the risk of loss inherent in wholesale-related contracts, an allowance forcredit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. See Note 14 on pages 123&#151;124 of thisForm 10-Q for a further discussion regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments.The following table summarizes the contractual amounts of off-balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments and guarantees and the related allowance for credit losses on lending-relatedcommitments at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and guarantees&nbsp;146 Table of ContentsIncluded in other unfunded commitments to extend credit are commitments to investment andnoninvestment grade counterparties in connection with leveraged acquisitions. These commitments aredependent on whether the acquisition by the borrower is successful, tend to be short-term in natureand, in most cases, are subject to certain conditions based upon the borrower's financial conditionor other factors. Additionally, the Firm often syndicates portions of the commitment to otherinvestors, depending on market conditions. These commitments often contain flexible pricingfeatures to adjust for changing market conditions prior to closing. Alternatively, the borrower mayturn to the capital markets for required funding instead of drawing on the commitment provided bythe Firm, and the commitment may expire unused. As such, these commitments are not necessarilyindicative of the Firm's actual risk and the total commitment amount may not reflect actual futurecash flow requirements. The amount of commitments related to leveraged acquisitions at September30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, were $5.9&nbsp;billion and $8.2&nbsp;billion, respectively.For a further discussion of the off-balance sheet lending-related arrangements the Firm considersto be guarantees under FIN 45, and the related accounting policies, see Note 31 on pages 170&#151;173of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The amount of the liability related to FIN 45 guaranteesrecorded at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, excluding the allowance for credit losses onlending-related commitments and derivative contracts discussed below was $368&nbsp;million and $335million, respectively.In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which theFirm is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45. For a discussionof the derivatives the Firm considers to be guarantees, and the related accounting policies, seeNote 31 on pages 170&#151;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. The total notional value of thederivatives that the Firm deems to be guarantees was $102.8&nbsp;billion and $85.3&nbsp;billion at September30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively. The fair values related to these contracts were aderivative receivables of $169&nbsp;million and $213&nbsp;million, and derivative payables of $5.8&nbsp;billionand $2.5&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007, respectively.Auction rate securitiesAs part of a settlement in conjunction with investigations in certain states of auction ratesecurities (&#147;ARS&#148;) activities, the Firm agreed with certain statesecurities regulators to offer to purchase an estimated $3.0&nbsp;billion inARS from certain customers. The difference between the aggregate purchase price and themarket value of the ARS to be purchased represents the Firm's exposure to loss under theagreements. The face amount of ARS to be purchased assuming a purchase price of par and marketvalue of zero represents the maximum potential amount of future payments under the agreements. TheFirm believes its exposure to pay this maximum potential amount, estimated to be $3.0&nbsp;billion,to be remote. Based on current market conditions, and on assumptions about the rate at which customers will tender securities, the Firm's preliminary estimate of the differencebetween the aggregate purchase price and market value of the ARS it will purchase under the programis approximately $375&nbsp;million on a pretax basis, which cost has been recognized in the third quarter of2008. The actual difference between the aggregate purchase price and the market value may varysignificantly from this preliminary estimate and will depend on future market conditions and theamount of ARS that are ultimately purchased.Residual value guaranteeIn connection with the Bear Stearns merger, the Firm succeeded to an operating lease arrangementfor the building located at 383 Madison Avenue in New York City (the &#147;Synthetic Lease&#148;). Under theterms of the Synthetic Lease, the Firm is obligated to make periodic payments based upon thelessor's underlying interest costs. The Synthetic Lease expires on November&nbsp;1, 2010. Under theterms of the Synthetic Lease, the Firm has the right to purchase the building for the amount of thethen outstanding indebtedness of the lessor or to arrange for the sale of the building with theproceeds of the sale to be used to satisfy the lessor's debt obligation. If the sale does notgenerate sufficient proceeds to satisfy the lessor's debt obligation, the Firm is required to fundthe shortfall up to a maximum residual value guarantee. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, there was noexpected shortfall and the maximum residual value guarantee was approximately $670 million. Undera separate ground lease, the land on which the building is built was leased to an affiliate of BearStearns which, as part of the Synthetic Lease, assigned this position to the Synthetic Leaselessor. The owner of the land has sued the Firm alleging that certain provisions of the mergeragreement with Bear Stearns violated a &#147;right of first offer&#148; provision of the ground lease. TheFirm has moved to dismiss the lawsuit on various grounds, including that the right of first offerprovision is inapplicable to the Bear Stearns merger.147 Table of ContentsLoans sold with recourseThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products related to theWashington Mutual transaction on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, theprincipal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e.,normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk withthe owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insureror guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sales proceeds of theproperty underlying a defaulted loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accruedinterest of the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm'ssecuritizations are primarily nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of futurecredit losses to the purchaser of the securities issued by the trust. As of September&nbsp;30, 2008, andDecember&nbsp;31, 2007, the unpaid principal balance of loans soldwith recourse totaled $15.7&nbsp;billionand $557&nbsp;million, respectively. Losses related to recourse obligations are not expected to besignificant.As part of the Firm's loan securitization activities, as described in Note 16 on pages 139&#151;145 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report, the Firm provides representations and warranties that certainsecuritized loans meet specific requirements. The Firm may be required to repurchase the loansand/or indemnify the purchaser of the loans against losses due to any breaches of suchrepresentations or warranties. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments the Firm would berequired to make under such repurchase and/or indemnification provisions would be equal to thecurrent amount of assets held by such securitization-related SPEs as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, plus,in certain circumstances, accrued and unpaid interest on such loans and certain expense.Historically, losses incurred on such repurchases and/or indemnifications have been inconsequentialbecause the collateral backing the loans was sufficient to recover the unpaid principal balance ofthe loans. Losses related to these representations and warranties could increase in future periodsdue to continued declines in housing prices.NOTE 30 &#151; CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONSConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of customers are engaged in similar businessactivities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic featuresthat would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changesin economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolio to assess potentialconcentration risks and to obtain collateral when deemed necessary. In the Firm's wholesaleportfolio, risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and by geographic region. In theconsumer portfolio, concentrations are evaluated primarily by product and by U.S. geographicregion.The Firm does not believe exposure to any one loan product with varying terms (e.g., interest-onlypayments for an introductory period, option ARMs) or exposure to loans with high loan-to-valueratios would result in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products andcollateral coverage are included in the Firm's assessment when extending credit and establishingits allowance for loan losses.For further information regarding on&#151;balance sheet credit concentrations by major product andgeography, see Note 13 on page 121 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 14 on page 137 of JPMorgan Chase's2007 Annual Report. For information regarding concentrations of off&#151;balance sheet lending-relatedfinancial instruments by major product, see Note 29 on page 146 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 31 onpages 170&#151;173 of JPMorgan Chase's 2007 Annual Report. More information about concentrations can befound in the following tables or discussion in the Management's Discussion and Analysis.148 Table of ContentsThe table below presents both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet wholesale- andconsumer-related credit exposure as of September&nbsp;30, 2008, and December&nbsp;31, 2007.&nbsp;NOTE 31 &#151; BUSINESS SEGMENTSJPMorgan Chase is organized into six major reportable business segments &#151; Investment Bank, RetailFinancial Services, Card Services, Commercial Banking (&#147;CB&#148;), Treasury & Securities Services(&#147;TSS&#148;) and Asset Management (&#147;AM&#148;), as well as a Corporate/Private Equity segment.
