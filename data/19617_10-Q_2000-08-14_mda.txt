 13PART IItem 2 (continued)FINANCIAL AND CREDIT DISCIPLINE: Chase seeks to manage its businesses withfinancial discipline, with attention to risk, capital and expense management.Credit costs decreased 9% in both the second quarter and first six months of2000, when compared with the same 1999 periods. Nonperforming assets at June30, 2000 were $1.90 billion, remaining low as a percentage of total assets. Thelevel of nonperforming assets at year-end 2000 is expected to be approximatelyat the same level as year-end 1999. Credit card charge-offs have continued todecline, while commercial credit costs remained stable.Chase's Tier One Capital ratio was 8.7% at June 30, 2000, compared with 8.4% ayear ago. In anticipation of the acquisition of Flemings, Chase did notrepurchase any shares of common stock during the 2000 second quarter.Total operating revenue growth was 2% for the 2000 second quarter and 8% forthe first half of 2000, primarily due to higher investment banking fees andtrading revenues, offset by lower private equity gains. Operating expensesincreased 13% and 16%, respectively, in the second quarter and first half of2000, as a result of higher incentive expenses to support the investmentbanking and trading businesses and a competitive recruiting environment inthese businesses.DIVERSITY OF FRANCHISE: The Global Bank (excluding CCP) had operating revenuegrowth of 11% for the 2000 second quarter and 17% for the first half, primarilyas a result of significant growth in its merger and acquisition ("M&A")advisory and trading businesses. During the second quarter and first half of2000, CCP had private equity gains of $298 million and $798 million,respectively. These results were driven by realized gains and initial publicofferings of investments in the portfolio.Global Services' operating earnings increased 23% and 32%, respectively, in the2000 second quarter and first half, over the prior year's periods, reflectingstrong growth in Chase's securities processing businesses and good expensemanagement.NCS had operating revenues of $2.5 billion in the 2000 second quarter and $4.9billion for the 2000 first half. These results were relatively flat whencompared with the same periods of 1999. Improved results from NCS' regionalbanking and middle market banking businesses were not enough to offsetpressures on credit card margins and mortgage production activities due torising interest rates.INVESTING FOR GROWTH: One of Chase's strategic priorities is investing forgrowth - a willingness to build those businesses where it has leadershippositions. Recent examples have been Chase's acquisition of Hambrecht & Quist("H&Q"), which was acquired on December 9, 1999 and the mortgage business ofMellon Bank N.A., which was acquired on September 30, 1999. The Beacon Group,LLC ("Beacon"), a privately-held investment banking firm, was acquired on July6, 2000 and the acquisition of Flemings was completed on August 1, 2000. Theseacquisitions are intended to continue to strengthen Chase's ability to benefitfrom the growth occurring in the global securities markets. See Other Eventson page 38 for a further discussion on Flemings and Beacon. At the same time,Chase continues to assess its strategic options, evaluating businesses andtheir competitive positions. These initiatives include assessing how theinternet can strengthen Chase's businesses, the relocations of businesses toimprove efficiencies and the exiting of nonstrategic businesses, such asChase's consumer operations in Panama and Hong Kong. These actions are allintended to position Chase for higher growth in the future.This Management's Discussion and Analysis contains certain forward-lookingstatements. Those forward-looking statements are subject to risks anduncertainties, and Chase's actual results may differ from those statements. SeeChase's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, inparticular the 1999 Annual Report, for a discussion of factors that may causesuch differences to occur. See Glossary of Terms on page 43 for a definitionof terms used throughout this Form 10-Q. -13-  14PART IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following section reviews Chase's results as reported in its financialstatements as well as on an operating basis. Management categorizes itsrevenue components as either market-sensitive or less market-sensitive. For afurther discussion of management's performance measurements, see page 20 ofChase's 1999 Annual Report.The table below provides a reconciliation between Chase's reported financialstatements and as presented on an operating basis.===============================================================================(a) Represents the amounts that are reported in Chase's financial statements. The only exception is that revenues are categorized between market-sensitive and less market-sensitive revenues.(b) This column excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. For securitized receivables, amounts that previously would have been reported as net interest income and as provision for loan losses instead are reported as components of noninterest revenue.(c) Includes restructuring costs and special items. For a description of special items, see Glossary of Terms on page 43.=============================================================================== -14-  15PART IItem 2 (continued)MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUESMarket-sensitive revenues are primarily derived from the sales of the productsand services of Chase's extensive Global Bank and CCP franchises. Theserevenues are typically more sensitive to global market factors than thoseproduced by other Chase businesses. These factors include movements inshort-term interest rates, which in turn affects the level of liquidity in themarkets, the prices of tradable securities and commodities, and the near-termprofitability of companies.In the second quarter of 2000, total market-sensitive revenues were relativelyflat from the same period last year and approximately $5 million above thelong-term trendline of market-sensitive revenues. For the first six months of2000, market-sensitive revenues were 16% above the 1999 same-period level. Fora further discussion of Chase's market-sensitive revenues, including adiscussion of Chase's trendline for its market-sensitive revenues, see pages21-23 of the 1999 Annual Report.==============================================================================================================================================================INVESTMENT BANKING FEESInvestment banking continued to produce strong results, with fees in the secondquarter and first half of 2000 increasing 9% and 43%, respectively, from1999. These increases were driven by record merger and acquisition advisoryfees and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by a decline from lastyear's record loan syndication and corporate bond underwriting fees. Resultsin the second quarter of 2000 were driven by the large number of merger andacquisition and equity underwriting deals, in contrast to the second quarter of1999, that was characterized by a few large loan syndication deals.Since the beginning of this year, the merger and acquisition practice has beenstrong and is anticipated to grow, particularly in the European and Asianmarkets. Chase, in recognition of these business developments, has beendeploying resources in these regions. The acquisition of Hambrecht & Quist inlate 1999 enabled Chase to enter and actively participate in the New Economyequities underwriting business, a rapidly growing sector. The strong resultsof the first six months of 2000 were somewhat offset by lower debtunderwriting fees, particularly in high-yield debt underwriting, which declinedfrom last year's levels and that of the first quarter of this year because ofthe rise in interest rates and the lack of certainty in the direction ofinterest rates. -15-  16PART IItem 2 (continued)TRADING-RELATED REVENUETotal trading revenues, including related net interest income, rose 15% to $841million for the 2000 second quarter and rose 20% to $1.89 billion for the firsthalf of 2000. The results reflected gains in most business products, includingforeign exchange ("FX"), equities and commodities.(a) Charge-offs for risk management instruments are included in trading revenue.(b) Trading-related net interest income includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations, reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(c) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures and options, forward rate agreements and related hedges.(d) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.(e) Includes equity securities, equity derivatives, commodities and commodity derivatives.(f) Includes U.S. and foreign government agency securities, corporate debt instruments, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives and credit derivatives.===============================================================================Revenue from interest rate contracts decreased slightly in the second quarterand first half of 2000, when compared with the prior-year's respective periods,as a result of the anticipated gradual increase in domestic interest rates in2000, generating less volatility and fewer opportunities to realize gains.Foreign exchange revenue in the second quarter 2000 increased by $40 million,and for the first six months increased by $120 million, due to increasedvolatility in foreign markets and client activity. Equities and commoditiesrevenue increased 100% in the 2000 second quarter and 134% for the first sixmonths, in large part as a result of equity trading at Chase H&Q and anincreased volume of commodity derivative transactions. The debt instrumentsand other category recorded strong revenue for the second quarter and first sixmonths of 2000 as a result of market-making and client activities in emergingmarkets and the U.S. fixed income market.SECURITIES GAINSSecurities investments primarily include liquid securities held in connectionwith Chase's treasury activities. Chase's domestic and international treasuryunits manage Chase's asset and liability interest rate risk. Securities gainsrealized in the second quarter of 2000 were $57 million, compared with $5million in the same period in the prior year. The higher gains were realizedin connection with Chase's asset/liability activities during the volatileinterest rate environment of the second quarter of 2000. Securities gains inthe first half of 2000 were $71 million, a 56% decrease over the same 1999period. The decline was due to the continuing increase in market interestrates since the middle of last year, reducing the value of the securities inthe portfolio. -16-  17PART IItem 2 (continued)PRIVATE EQUITY GAINSPrivate equity gains largely result from the business of CCP, one of theworld's largest and most diversified private equity investment firms. Thedeclines in private equity gains from the respective 1999 periods were theresult of lower stock prices for NASDAQ-traded securities during the early partof the 2000 second quarter, causing a reduction in the market value of theseinvestments, in particular investments that had gone public since the secondquarter of 1999.Net gains include cash realized from the sale of both publicly-held andprivately-held securities in the portfolio and unrealized changes in the marketvalue of securities, including appreciation as a result of initial publicofferings.==============================================================================================================================================================The level of investments continues to grow. Direct equity investments were$1.7 billion for the first six months of 2000, compared with approximately $800million for the same 1999 period. The growth of direct equity investments isattributable to new opportunities in several industry groups (and during thefirst quarter of 2000 an equity market receptive to technology andtelecommunications stocks).The carrying values of the investments recorded on Chase's financial statementsare net of the interests of investors other than Chase (i.e., participations bythird-party investors), and reflect liquidity discounts applied by Chase onthese securities. In addition, approximately 75% of the carrying value of theportfolio consists of privately-held securities generally carried at cost,which in management's judgment, approximates fair value. The volatility in theearly part of the second quarter of 2000 in the prices of NASDAQ-listedsecurities had no impact on the carrying value of this portion of theportfolio.Chase believes that CCP's equity-related investments will continue to createvalue for the Corporation, making substantial contributions to its earningsover time. However, given the volatile nature of the public equities market,and that of the NASDAQ market in particular, Chase's reported private equityresults may include significant unrealized valuation adjustments, bothfavorable and unfavorable, in any given quarter.The table below shows the direct and fund investment components of Chase'sportfolio, totaling $10.9 billion at June 30, 2000.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO==============================================================================================================================================================In addition, CCP manages $9.0 billion of leveraged loan/high-yield funds andinvestments in other equity and asset funds, bringing total funds undermanagement to $19.9 billion. For a further discussion of CCP's business, visitthe CCP web site at: www.chasecapital.com. -17-  18PART IItem 2 (continued)LESS MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUELess market-sensitive revenues derive largely from Chase's extensive domesticconsumer banking business, global services and global private bankingfranchises and from credit products provided to large corporate and middle-market clients. These revenues generally experience less market volatilitythan those global banking and CCP revenues which are characterized asmarket-sensitive.Less market-sensitive revenues increased by 3% in the 2000 second quarter andby 4% in the first half of 2000, reflecting increases in trust, custody andinvestment management fees and fees for other financial services. Theseincreases were partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Net interestincome ("NII") and credit card revenue remained relatively flat. For a furtherdiscussion of less market-sensitive revenues, see pages 24-26 of Chase's 1999Annual Report.===============================================================================(a) Presented on an operating basis.===============================================================================NET INTEREST INCOMELess market-sensitive NII on an operating basis adjusts reported NII to reflectthe impact of credit card securitizations and the trading-related NII that isconsidered part of market-sensitive revenue. The following table reconcilesreported NII and less market-sensitive operating NII.===============================================================================(a) Disclosed on a taxable equivalent basis.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.=============================================================================== -18-  19PART IItem 2 (continued)For the second quarter and first six months of 2000, reported NII declined 11%when compared with each of the same periods in 1999, while operating NIIdeclined only slightly in each period of 2000. Reported NII during 2000 hasbeen adversely affected by a decline in trading-related NII as earning assetsheld to support Chase's trading businesses yielded minimal net interest income(see Trading-Related Revenue on page 16). Also affecting both reported andoperating NII in the first six months of 2000 was a $100 million decrease inthe estimated auto lease residual value, which was accounted for as a reductionin net interest income in the first quarter of 2000. This adjustment in theestimated auto lease residual value addressed exposure to potential losses onmaturing leases as a result of a decline in the market value of autos returnedby lessees at lease termination.Managed average interest-earning assets increased 7% and 5%, respectively, fromthe 1999 second quarter and first six months. Contributing to the increases inboth periods were higher amounts of liquid assets, domestic consumer loans(primarily residential mortgages) and domestic commercial loans. Partiallyoffsetting these increases was a decline in the average foreign commercial loanportfolio, as Chase reduced its exposure to emerging markets throughout 1999.The net yield on a managed basis decreased 28 basis points in the 2000 secondquarter and 25 basis points in the 2000 first six months. The rising interestrate environment that began in the second half of 1999 resulted in generallynarrower spreads, particularly in the consumer sector (notably credit cards).Additionally, as a result of decreases in the volume of interest-free funds(noninterest-bearing funds which support interest-earning assets),interest-free funds contributed 4 basis points less to the net yield in thesecond quarter of 2000 than in the second quarter of 1999, and contributed 8basis points less in the first half of 2000 than in the first half of 1999.TRUST, CUSTODY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEESTrust, custody and investment management fees rose to a record level of $545million in the second quarter of 2000, which was 7% above the 2000 firstquarter (the previous record high) and 18% above the prior year's quarter. Thetwo consecutive quarters have resulted in a 20% increase in fees from the 1999first six months, resulting in record levels for these businesses. Theseresults were attributable to growth in the values of assets under custody andinvestment management and an increase in flows of investments to foreignmarkets (where the safekeeping of securities is most profitable).==============================================================================================================================================================(a) Represents fees for trustee, agency, registrar, securities-lending and broker clearing, custody and maintenance of securities.(b) Represents fees for trustee, estate, custody, advisory and investment management services.(c) Represents investment management, administrative, custody and other fees in connection with Chase's proprietary global mutual funds.===============================================================================The following table shows the growth in Chase's assets under custody and undermanagement.============================================================================================================================================================== -19-  20PART IItem 2 (continued)CREDIT CARD REVENUECredit card revenues include interchange income; late, cash advance, annual andoverlimit fees; and servicing fees associated with the securitization of creditcards. Credit card revenue on an operating basis declined slightly from boththe second quarter and first half of 1999. The declines were driven by lowerlate fees as a result of a reduction in customer delinquencies as demonstratedby a more than 70 bp improvement in the managed net charge-off ratios for bothperiods. The decrease in late fees was partially offset by an increase ininterchange income (transaction processing fees) associated with highercustomer purchase volumes.The following table reconciles Chase's reported credit card revenue andoperating credit card revenue, which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations.==============================================================================================================================================================FEES FOR OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICESFees for other financial services in the second quarter of 2000 increased 18%,when compared with the same period in the prior year. In the first six monthsof 2000, the fees grew by 25% relative to 1999. The table below provides thesignificant components of fees for other financial services.==============================================================================================================================================================MORTGAGE SERVICING FEES in the 2000 second quarter and first six monthsincreased by 70% and 98%, respectively, from the same periods in 1999. Theincreases were due to a larger servicing portfolio and a lower amortizationrate on mortgage servicing rights. The servicing portfolio increased 36% fromlast year's second quarter as a result of the acquisition of the Mellon BankCorporation mortgage servicing business at the end of the third quarter of1999, coupled with lower loan prepayments in the core portfolio. Starting inthe latter part of the second quarter of 1999, mortgage interest rates began torise, which has had the effect of reducing the prepayment rates on mortgageloans which, in turn, has lowered the amortization rate of mortgage servicingrights. -20-  21PART IItem 2 (continued)SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS increased 7% during the second quarter of 2000 and9% during the first half of 2000, reflecting the benefits of selected pricinginitiatives.BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES rose 52% from the 1999 second quarter and 97%from the first half of 1999. The increase was due to significant increases inboth daily trading volume and the number of new customers at Brown & Company,coupled with the acquisition of H&Q in the fourth quarter of 1999. The tradingvolume at Brown & Co. in the second quarter of 2000 was up to 46,000 trades perday compared with 33,000 trades per day in the same quarter of 1999.INSURANCE FEES include fees from credit-related products (such as insuring thepayment of credit card and auto loans in the event of loss of life, disabilityand other catastrophic events) as well as from non-credit-related products(such as life, health and property insurance, and annuities). In the 2000second quarter, insurance fees were 15% higher than the 1999 second quarter and20% higher than the 1999 first six months, primarily due to higher annuitysales and new business relating to life and health insurance.OTHER FEES in 2000 increased 22% from the 1999 second quarter and 14% from thefirst half of 1999, reflecting higher interchange fees related to a largervolume of debit card transactions and a general increase in the otherfee-generating activities at several businesses.OTHER REVENUE==============================================================================================================================================================RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES (which include origination and sales of loansand selective dispositions of mortgage servicing rights) in both the secondquarter and first six months of 2000 declined 53%, reflecting the impact of therising interest rate environment in 2000 that unfavorably affected originationvolume and gains on loan sales.ALL OTHER REVENUE remained flat in the second quarter of this year compared withthe same period in 1999, but was $16 million higher than the first six months of1999, reflecting the increase in revenues from auto operating leases. Theincrease for the first half of 2000 was partially offset by a decrease inrevenue from the Octagon Investment Fund (which was established in early 1998and was substantially sold to investors in late 1999) and lower gains from thesale of student loans in 2000.The second quarter and six month results include a $141 million loss resultingfrom the economic hedge of the purchase price of Flemings prior to itsacquisition (the offsetting appreciation in the dollar versus pound sterlingexchange rate will be reflected as a reduction in the purchase price andcorresponding goodwill). Results for the 1999 second quarter and first sixmonths included $166 million in gains from sales of nonstrategic assets, ofwhich $95 million was from the sale of a building and $71 million was from thesale of branches in Texas. -21-  22Part IItem 2 (continued)NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal operating noninterest expenses increased 13% in the second quarter of2000 and 16% in the first half of 2000, when compared with the same periods in1999. These increases reflected higher incentives related to market-sensitiverevenues in the Global Bank, including the acquisition of H&Q in late 1999. Themanagement of operating noninterest expense to support revenue growth is animportant objective of Chase's management.Reported noninterest expense for 2000 included $50 million of nonaccruablerestructuring costs associated with previously announced relocation programs,while in 1999 it included a special contribution to The Chase ManhattanFoundation.===============================================================================(a) Excludes costs associated with REIT and the impact of credit card securitizations.(b) Excludes the impact of amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles.===============================================================================SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITSThe increases in salaries and employee benefits from the second quarter andfirst half of 1999 were due to higher incentives, primarily driven by growth ininvestment banking and trading revenues and the net addition of over 700full-time equivalent employees. The higher headcount was attributable to theacquisition of H&Q and a mortgage servicing business, partly offset by theimpact of staff reductions related to initiatives to streamline supportfunctions and realign business activities in selected areas.==============================================================================================================================================================OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSEOccupancy expense increased over both 1999 periods primarily due to increasedleasing costs related to existing domestic and overseas office spaces, coupledwith business expansions and acquisitions in the second half of 1999. Equipmentexpense rose in both 2000 periods as a result of greater depreciation expenserelating to the capitalization of more advanced hardware systems, as well ashigher costs for additional software to support ongoing internet businessprojects throughout various business areas of Chase.OTHER EXPENSEOperating other expense (excluding the special contribution to The ChaseManhattan Foundation) rose 15% from the second quarter of 1999 and 13% from thefirst half of 1999. The following table presents the components of otherexpense: -22-  23Part IItem 2 (continued)==============================================================================================================================================================(a) Includes REIT minority interest expense of $11 million in each quarter and $22 million in each six months.===============================================================================The increase in PROFESSIONAL SERVICES for the second quarter and first half of2000 reflected higher management and systems consultant costs associated withthe development of Chase's internet initiatives and the impact of the H&Qacquisition. The spending on internet projects was partly offset by reducedexpenditures related to completed Y2K efforts. MARKETING expense increased inthe 2000 second quarter but decreased in the first half of 2000, when comparedto the same 1999 periods, as a result of the timing differences of variousmedia campaigns. TELECOMMUNICATIONS rose due to higher market data usagestemming from growth in business volume at Chase's Global Bank franchises andthe addition of Chase H&Q. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased in connectionwith the acquisitions in 1999, in particular, H&Q. TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENTincreased mainly as a result of higher expenses at both domestic and overseasunits and the impact of Chase H&Q. ALL OTHER EXPENSE rose reflecting theimpact of Chase H&Q and higher employee-related expenditures, such as domesticrelocation and executive search/recruitment expenses.RESTRUCTURING COSTSIn the 1999 fourth quarter, Chase began a process of long-term strategicrestructuring initiatives, such as the announced relocation of operations tolower cost locations, and other business initiatives, such as the consolidationof operations. Chase incurred a $175 million restructuring charge in connectionwith these initiatives. For a further discussion of Chase's restructuringcosts, refer to Note 12 and page 28 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report and Note 4 ofthis Form 10-Q.Chase is continuing to focus on its future expense management and additionalrelocation initiatives and business initiatives are expected to be announcedduring the remainder of 2000 and into 2001.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs include credit losses related to Chase's securitized credit cardloans. The following table shows the components of credit costs:==============================================================================================================================================================Credit costs in the second quarter and first half of 2000 decreased $60 millionand $114 million, respectively, from the 1999 levels, primarily due to lowercredit losses in the consumer portfolio, primarily credit cards.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $586 million in the second quarter of2000, compared with $767 million in the second quarter of 1999. For the firsthalf of 2000, Chase recorded income tax expense of $1.3 billion compared with$1.4 billion for the first half of 1999. The effective tax rates were 34.9% inthe 2000 second quarter and 35.0% for the 2000 first six months, compared with35.5% in both 1999 periods. The continued improvement in the effective taxrate was the result of tax planning initiatives. -23-  24Part IItem 2 (continued)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basisfor Chase's four major business franchises. Prior periods have been restatedto reflect refinements in management reporting policies or changes to themanagement organization. For example, commencing with the second quarter of2000, results for Chase Capital Partners ("CCP") are disclosed separately fromthe remainder of the Global Bank. In addition, the private equity business ofChase H&Q has been moved to CCP from Global Investment Banking.For a description of the basis of presentation that management uses to measureand evaluate business unit profitability, see page 20 of the 1999 AnnualReport.===============================================================================(a) Excludes Chase Capital Partners.(b) Cash Operating Earnings represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles.bp - Denotes basis points; 100bp equals 1%.=============================================================================== -24-  25Part IItem 2 (continued)GLOBAL BANK (EXCLUDING CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERS)Global Bank combines the strengths of a leading commercial bank and a leadinginvestment bank to meet the needs of corporations, institutional investors,financial institutions, governments, entrepreneurs and private clients aroundthe world. The Global Bank integrates a broad range of leading productcapabilities, industry knowledge and geographic reach to produce superiorcustomer solutions. Through its presence in more than 45 countries, the GlobalBank serves an extensive array of clients, from large corporations withlong-standing global relationships to a growing franchise of clients in thefastest growing sectors of the New Economy.Operating revenues in the Global Bank in the second quarter of 2000 increased11% from the second quarter of 1999. Cash operating earnings and ShareholderValue Added declined 2% and 5%, respectively, from the second quarter of 1999,reflecting increased cash expenses. Cash expenses of $1.32 billion in thesecond quarter of 2000 increased 26% from the second quarter of last year, butwere $60 million lower than in the first quarter of 2000. The principalreasons for the increase were higher incentives related to the growth inmarket-sensitive revenues and the acquisition of H&Q. In the first half of2000, operating revenues, cash operating earnings, and Shareholder Value Addedincreased 17%, 7% and 15%, respectively, reflecting strong investment andprivate banking results.

The following discussion focuses on thefinancial highlights of each business for the second quarter and first sixmonths of 2000. -25-  26Part IItem 2 (continued)GLOBAL MARKETSOperating revenues for Global Markets, although slightly lower than in thesecond quarter and first six months of 1999, remained strong during 2000. Totaltrading revenues, including related net interest income, rose 15% to $841million in the 2000 second quarter and rose 20% to $1.9 billion for the firsthalf of 2000, driven by foreign exchange and equity and commodities trading.Cash operating earnings decreased 10% in the 2000 second quarter, and declined11% for the first six months of 2000, due to higher incentives and otherexpenses.Chase's treasury businesses are managed through a "total return" discipline,which measures economic value-added by capturing both realized income(securities gains and net interest income) and unrealized gains or losses onassets and liabilities. The total return (pre-tax before expenses) from theinterest rate risk management activities of the treasury units amounted to $300million for the second quarter 2000 and $526 million for the first half of2000, compared with $(11) million and $240 million, respectively, for the sameperiods in 1999.GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKINGRevenues and cash operating earnings for the Global Investment Bank increased37% and 5%, respectively, in the 2000 second quarter when compared with the1999 second quarter. When combined with the particularly strong 2000 firstquarter, revenues and cash operating earnings rose 86% and 106%, respectively,in the first half of 2000. These results were driven by record merger andacquisition advisory fees and equity underwriting fees, partially offset by adecline from last year's particularly strong loan syndication and corporatebond underwriting fees.CORPORATE LENDING AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENTCorporate Lending and Portfolio Management revenues and cash operating earningseach declined in the second quarter and first six months of 2000, when comparedwith the same periods in 1999, as a result of the effect of lower average loanlevels (due to securitizations), partially offset by higher lending-relatedfees.GLOBAL PRIVATE BANKGlobal Private Bank revenues increased to $285 million in the second quarter of2000, a 33% increase from the same period a year ago. For the first half of2000, revenues increased 46% and cash operating earnings increased 67% from thesame prior-year period. The revenue increases for both periods were due tobroad-based growth globally and the inclusion of revenues from the ExecutiveFinancial Services Division at Chase H&Q. As of June 30, 2000, the GlobalPrivate Bank had over $170 billion in client assets under management.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERSChase Capital Partners is one of the world's largest and most diversifiedprivate equity investment firms with approximately $10.9 billion in direct andfund investments. In addition, CCP manages $9 billion of leveragedloan/high-yield funds and investments in other equity and asset funds, bringingtotal funds under management to $19.9 billion.===============================================================================bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.===============================================================================Operating revenues and cash operating earnings decreased 50% and 56%,respectively, in the 2000 second quarter as a result of the lower stock pricesfor NASDAQ-traded securities during the early part of the quarter, whichprincipally affected the publicly-held securities within CCP's investmentportfolio (approximately 25% of the total portfolio). Revenues and cashoperating earnings declined 14% and 21%, respectively, in the first six monthsof 2000, principally due to the market declines of the 2000 second quarter,partially offset by cash gains from the sales of securities. -26-  27Part IItem 2 (continued)NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICESNational Consumer Services serves over 30 million customers nationwide offeringa wide variety of financial products and services through a diverse array ofdistribution channels. NCS is focused on delivering financial solutions toconsumers, as well as middle market and small businesses, across the U.S.Financial solutions are delivered through distribution channels that includebranch and ATM networks, internet banking, telephone and direct mail.Operating revenues for National Consumer Services increased to $2.5 billion, anincrease of 1% over the second quarter of 1999. Cash operating earnings of$443 million increased by 6% for the second quarter of 2000. This increase wasdriven by regional banking, the retail investment businesses, and middle marketbanking, partially offset by continuing weak origination volumes and pressureson credit card margins due to rising interest rates. Operating revenues forthe first six months of 2000 were flat when compared with the first six monthsof 1999; cash operating earnings were 2% lower than the same period in 1999.The first quarter of 2000 included a $100 million decrease in auto leaseresidual values, which was accounted for as a reduction in net interest income.Results for NCS over the remainder of 2000 are expected to reflect the benefitsof expense management, good credit quality and moderating revenue growth.Management expects that results for NCS in the second half of this year will besimilar to the first half.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within NCS.===============================================================================NM Not meaningful.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.===============================================================================For a discussion of the profiles for each business within NCS, see page 33 ofChase's 1999 Annual Report. The following discussion focuses on the 2000 secondquarter and first six months financial highlights of each business. -27-  28PART IItem 2 (continued)CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICESCash operating earnings for Chase Cardmember Services for the second quarter of2000 were up 3% when compared with the second quarter of 1999, reflectingsignificantly improved credit quality. Expenses were down in the second quarterdespite higher technology and e-commerce investments. Operating revenuesdeclined in the second quarter and first half of 2000, reflecting reduced netinterest spreads due to rising interest rates and a lower level of late andoverlimit fees, partly offset by higher consumer purchase volumes.REGIONAL BANKING GROUPRegional Banking Group revenues rose 11% from the second quarter of 1999 andcash operating earnings grew by 26%, with similar increases in revenues andcash operating earnings from the first six months of 1999, reflecting higherdeposit levels in the small business sector, the benefit from higher interestrates, growth in fees and disciplined expense management.CHASE HOME FINANCEChase Home Finance revenues increased to $318 million, an 8% increase fromsecond quarter of 1999, and rose to $642 million, a 12% increase from the firstsix months of 1999. Cash operating earnings were flat compared with the 1999second quarter, and increased 2% when compared with the first six months of1999. Growth in servicing fee income for both 2000 periods was partially offsetby declines in mortgage production activities due to the rising interest rateenvironment. Origination volume declined in the first half of 2000, whencompared with the 1999 level, as a result of the rising interest rateenvironment. Originations (residential, home equity and manufactured housing)for the quarter were $18.2 billion and included originations from the retail,wholesale and correspondent (traditional and negotiated) channels.DIVERSIFIED CONSUMER SERVICESRevenues from Diversified Consumer Services were $281 million in the secondquarter of 2000, a 1% decrease from the same quarter in 1999. Continued growthin the investment businesses were partially offset by the effect of higherinterest rates and weak auto lease origination activity. Additionally, as aresult of a $100 million decrease in the estimated auto lease residual value inthe 2000 first quarter, operating revenues and cash operating earnings declined12% and 63%, respectively, in the first six months of 2000. Revenues from theadvice-based investment business rose to $129 million for the first six monthsof 2000, an 11% increase when compared with the same period last year.MIDDLE MARKETSMiddle Market revenues were $270 million, an increase of 4% from the secondquarter of 1999, and were $538 million, an increase of 7% from the first sixmonths of 1999. Cash operating earnings increased 11% over the prior-yearquarter and 19% over the prior-year six months. These results reflectdisciplined expense management, continued strength in new business andfinancing activities during 2000, and higher deposit volumes and spreads. -28-  29PART IItem 2 (continued)GLOBAL SERVICESGlobal Services is a recognized leader in information and transactionprocessing services, moving trillions of dollars daily in securities and cashfor its wholesale customers. For a discussion of the profiles for each businesswithin Global Services, see page 34 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.In the second quarter of 2000, Global Services' operating revenues increased14% over the prior-year quarter to $877 million, reflecting increased activityin all of its businesses. Cash operating earnings for Global Services for thesecond quarter of 2000 increased 20% when compared with the 1999 secondquarter. Shareholder Value added increased to $75 million, an 83% increase overthe prior year quarter. In the first half of 2000, operating revenues, cashoperating earnings and Shareholder Value Added increased 15%, 28% and 155%,respectively.Global Investor Services, Chase's custody business, experienced an 18% and 23%rise in operating revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2000,respectively, when compared with the same periods a year ago. During the 2000second quarter, total assets under custody grew 16%, with cross-border assetsunder custody increasing 29%, when compared with the 1999 second quarter.Operating revenues at Capital Markets Fiduciary Services, Chase's institutionaltrust business, increased 14% from the 1999 second quarter and 21% from the1999 first six months, reflecting continued growth through expansion into newmarkets and the benefit of servicing structured issues (asset-andmortgage-backed securities transactions) in the U.S. as well as Europe.Operating revenues at Chase Treasury Solutions, Chase's cash management andpayments business, increased 8% in the 2000 second quarter and increased 5% inthe 2000 first half, when compared with the prior-year periods, benefiting fromrising rates and the resulting impact on balances maintained by customers.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATESupport Units include Chase.com, Chase Business Services and TechnologySolutions. For a further discussion of the business profile of these supportunits, see page 35 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.Corporate includes the effects remaining at the corporate level after theimplementation of management accounting policies. For the second quarter of2000 and 1999, Corporate and the other support units had cash operatingearnings of $4 million and $7 million, respectively. For the first six monthsof 2000 and 1999, there was a cash operating loss of $6 million and $38million, respectively, for these units. Chase utilizes an internal expenseallocation process that aligns the cost of each of its operational and staffsupport services with the respective revenue-generating business. This allowsChase to evaluate the performance of each of its businesses on a fullyallocated basis. -29-  30PART IItem 2 (continued)- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1999 and should be read in conjunction withpages 37-44 and 62-64 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.=============================================================================(a) Represents the portion of Chase's credit card receivables that have been securitized.(b) Includes currently performing loans placed on a cash basis because of concerns as to collectibility.(c) Charge-offs for risk management instruments are included in trading revenue.=============================================================================== -30-  31PART IItem 2 (continued)Chase's managed credit-related assets of $230 billion at June 30, 2000increased 1%, compared with year-end 1999. Consumer managed credit-relatedassets increased $1.7 billion, largely in the 1-4 family residential mortgageportfolio, and commercial loans rose $4.3 billion, notably in the domesticcommercial and industrial loan portfolio, while derivative and foreign exchangeinstruments declined $3.7 billion. Chase's credit-related portfolio is balancedbetween commercial and consumer assets, with consumer assets comprisingapproximately 47% of Chase's managed credit-related portfolio. The creditquality of Chase's commercial credit-related assets, including derivative andforeign exchange instruments, remains strong. The portion of the commercialportfolio considered investment grade was 55% at June 30, 2000.Management currently believes that Chase's nonperforming assets at December 31,2000 will be approximately at the same level as December 31, 1999, although theamount of nonperforming assets may modestly increase or decrease in any givenquarter over the remainder of the year.Net charge-offs in the managed portfolio were $574 million in the secondquarter of 2000, a decline of $60 million from the second quarter of 1999,reflecting decreases in net charge-offs in the managed credit card portfolio.Management expects that credit costs in 2000, on a managed basis, will remainrelatively stable over the remainder of the year and will be of a similarmagnitude to total credit costs incurred in 1999. For the consumer portfolio,management expects net charge-off rates in 2000 will be lower than in 1999;however, reported net charge-offs will vary depending on the level of creditcard securitizations completed during the year. The commercial charge-off ratevaries more than the consumer charge-off rate, and over time Chase expectsannual commercial net charge-offs to be in a range of 40-60 bp. Managementexpects the commercial charge-off rate for the remainder of 2000 to remainrelatively stable with the level for the first six months of 2000.AVERAGE ANNUAL NET CHARGE-OFF RATES(a) Includes domestic and foreign consumer and commercial credit card activity.(b) Includes foreign loans.==============================================================================CONSUMER LOANSChase's consumer portfolio is primarily domestic and is geographicallywell-diversified. Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled $108 billion atJune 30, 2000, an increase of $1.7 billion since year-end. Consumer netcharge-offs, on a managed basis, were $482 million and $1,006 million for thesecond quarter and first six months of 2000, compared with $548 million and$1,110 million for the same periods of 1999, primarily reflecting a decline incredit card net charge-offs. Management anticipates credit quality in theconsumer portfolio to remain stable, or to improve slightly, over the remainderof the year.RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS: Residential mortgage loans were $47.6 billion atJune 30, 2000, a $3.3 billion increase from year-end balances, while the levelof nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased 6%. The loss rates of .09% for the 2000 second quarter and .08% for the first six months of 2000reflect the continued strong credit quality of this portfolio. -31-  32PART IItem 2 (continued)CREDIT CARD LOANS: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a "managedbasis," which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well ascredit card receivables that have been securitized. The amounts discussed belowinclude domestic and international consumer and commercial credit card activity(for reporting purposes, commercial credit cards are reported within thecommercial loan category).Average managed credit card receivables of $32.6 billion for the second quarterof 2000 were relatively flat when compared with the same period of 1999. Duringthe 2000 second quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit cardreceivables decreased to 5.09%, compared with 5.80% in the prior-year period.Loans over 90 days past due dropped to 1.68% of the portfolio at June 30, 2000,compared with 1.80% at June 30, 1999. Management anticipates that the managedcredit card net charge-off ratio for the full-year 2000 will be lower thanfull-year 1999.AUTO FINANCINGS: Auto financings outstanding remained stable at June 30, 2000when compared with year-end 1999. The charge-off rate of .47% for the 2000second quarter is indicative of this portfolio's selective approach to assetorigination. Total originations were $5.1 billion for the first six months of2000, compared with $6.7 billion for the same 1999 period.OTHER CONSUMER LOANS: The level of other domestic consumer loans of $6.4billion at June 30, 2000 represents a decrease of $0.5 billion from year-endlevels. Net charge-offs related to the portfolio decreased in both the secondquarter and first six months of 2000. The decrease in net charge-offs reflectsthe sale in late 1999 of an underperforming segment of a secured portfolio.COMMERCIAL LOANSLoan outstandings for Chase's commercial portfolio increased $4.3 billion sinceyear-end. Commercial net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2000 were $92million, compared with $86 million in the second quarter of 1999. For the firsthalf of 2000, commercial net charge-offs were $164 million, compared with $173million for the same 1999 period.COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL: The domestic commercial and industrial portfolioincreased $2.0 billion from 1999 year-end, reflecting general businessactivity. Net charge-offs in the 2000 second quarter amounted to $64 million,or 53 bp on an annual basis. The foreign commercial and industrial portfoliototaled $26.3 billion at June 30, 2000, an increase of 5% from the 1999year-end level. Nonperforming foreign commercial and industrial loans were $747million, an increase of $105 million from year-end 1999. Foreign net charge-offlevels for the second quarter of 2000 decreased to $21 million, or by 64%, fromthe same period in 1999.COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: Commercial real estate loans decreased $0.5 billionfrom 1999 year-end levels principally as a result of securitizations, sales andrepayments.FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: Loans to financial institutions increased $2.2 billionduring 2000 when compared with year-end, primarily in the domestic portion ofthe portfolio. Nonperforming financial institution loans decreased 73% to $29million, primarily due to one counterparty in the foreign portfolio returningto performing status.FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS: Foreign government loans were $2.7 billion at June 30,2000, a $0.6 billion decrease from year-end levels. Nonperforming foreigngovernment loans decreased to $34 million, or by 17%, from 1999 year-endlevels.DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized inconnection with Chase's trading and A/L activities, see page 42 and Notes 1 and19 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at June 30,2000 and December 31, 1999. -32-  33PART IItem 2 (continued)CROSS-BORDER EXPOSUREThe following table presents Chase's exposure to emerging Latin America andAsia. Cross-border disclosure is based on the Federal Financial InstitutionsExamination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines governing the determination ofcross-border risk. For a further discussion of Chase's country exposure, seepage 43 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.(a) Cross-border disclosure is based on FFIEC guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. Under FFIEC guidelines, resale agreements are reported by the country of the issuer of the underlying security. Chase, however, does not consider the cross-border risk of resale agreements to depend upon the country of the issuer of the underlying security and, as a result, has presented these amounts separately in the above table.(b) Includes loans and accrued interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit and undrawn commitments to extend credit.(c) Includes cross-border trading debt and equity instruments and the mark-to-market exposure of foreign exchange and derivative contracts. The amounts associated with foreign exchange and derivative contracts are presented after taking into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.(d) Excludes Bermuda and Cayman Islands.(e) Excludes Japan, Australia and New Zealand.===============================================================================ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESLoans: Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probable creditlosses as of June 30, 2000 for which either the asset is not specificallyidentified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined. Within theallowance, there are both specific and expected loss components as well as aresidual component. For a further discussion of the specific, expected andresidual components of the allowance for loan losses, see page 44 of Chase's1999 Annual Report. The allowance for loan losses remained at $3.5 billion atJune 30, 2000, consistent with the level at 1999 year-end. Based uponmanagement's current expectations regarding credit quality over the remainderof the year, it does not anticipate the need to increase Chase's allowance forloan losses over the next two quarters.Lending-Related Commitments: Chase also has an allowance for itslending-related commitments, using a methodology similar to that for the loanportfolio. -33-  34Part 1Item 2 (continued)The following table represents Chase's allowance for credit losses at June 30,2000 and 1999.Chase deems its allowances to be adequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb lossesthat may currently exist but are not yet identifiable).- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1999 and should be read in conjunction withpages 45-50 and Notes 1 and 19 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.VAR AGGREGATE EXPOSUREValue-at-risk ("VAR") is a measure of the dollar amount of potential loss fromadverse market moves in an everyday market environment. The VAR looks forwardone trading day and is the loss expected to be exceeded with a 1 in 100 chance.The table that follows represents Chase's average and period-end VARs for itstrading portfolios and its A/L activities. During the 12-month period ended June30, 2000, no daily trading loss exceeded that day's trading VAR. This compareswith a statistically expected number of actual losses that exceed the VAR ofapproximately three days. NM: Because the minimum and maximum VAR may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect. In addition, Chase's average and period-end VAR is less than the sum of the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.===============================================================================TRADING ACTIVITIESChase is exposed to interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commoditymarket risks in its trading portfolios. No single risk statistic can reflectall aspects of market risk; in addition, market exposures change continuouslythrough daily trading activities.Value-at-Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section above for Chase's averageand period-end VARs for its total trading portfolio. -34-  35PART IItem 2 (continued)Histogram: The following histogram illustrates Chase's daily marketrisk-related revenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of themark-to-market trading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest incomeor other revenue. Based on actual trading results for the 12 months ended June30, 2000, Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 253 outof 262 business trading days, with 88 business days exceeding positive $20million. Chase incurred no daily trading losses in excess of negative $15million over the past 12 months. [ Graphic of Daily Market Risk-Related Revenue - See Appendix I ]Stress Testing: Whereas VAR captures Chase's exposure to unlikely events innormal markets, stress testing discloses the risk under plausible events inabnormal markets. Portfolio stress testing is integral to the market riskmanagement process and is co-equal with, and complementary to, VAR as a riskmeasurement and control tool. Giving equal weight to each produces a riskprofile that is diverse, disciplined and flexible enough to capture revenuegenerating opportunities during times of normal market moves but that also isprepared for periods of market turmoil.Corporate stress tests are performed monthly on randomly selected dates. As ofJune 30, 2000, Chase's corporate stress tests consisted of five historical andfour hypothetical scenarios. The historical scenarios included the 1994 bondmarket sell-off and the 1998 Russian crisis. The hypothetical scenariosincluded examinations of potential market crises originating in the UnitedStates, Japan and the Euro bloc.The following table represents the potential stress test loss (pre-tax) inChase's trading portfolio predicted by Chase's stress test scenarios. -35-  36PART IItem 2 (continued)INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSET/LIABILITY ACTIVITIESChase also has market risk exposure in its investment portfolios and A/Lactivities. Market risk measurements for Chase's investment portfolio and A/Lactivities do not take into account all factors that have an effect on theseactivities, such as changes in credit quality.Net Interest Income Sensitivity: At June 30, 2000, Chase's NII sensitivity overthe next 12 months to an immediate 100 basis point shock in interest rates wasestimated to be approximately 3.7% of projected net income for full year 2000.At June 30, 1999, Chase's exposure under the same scenario was approximately2.6% of projected 1999 net income.Net Interest Income Stress Test: Chase's NII stress testing uses historical andhypothetical scenarios. The historical scenario is a replay of the rate andspread changes that occurred in 1994 (bond market sell-off), while the varioushypothetical scenarios examine the impact of alternative patterns in the U.S.dollar yield curve and in U.S. dollar spreads. At June 30, 2000, Chase'slargest potential NII stress test loss was estimated to be approximately 12.4%of projected net income for full year 2000. At year-end 1999, Chase's exposurewas estimated to be approximately 8% of projected net income for full year2000.Value-at-Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section on page 34 for Chase'saverage and period-end VARs for its investment portfolio and marketrisk-related A/L activities.Nonstatistical Risk Measures: The table that follows shows that Chase had adirectional basis point value ("BPV") of ($4.0) million (pre-tax), indicatingthat the market value of Chase's A/L positions would have declined byapproximately $4.0 million for every one basis point increase in interest ratesalong the interest rate yield curve. This compares with a directional BPV of($5.0) million at June 30, 1999. The following table also shows that theeconomic value of Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities would havedeclined by $11.3 million (pre-tax) for every one basis point widening ofinterest spreads, the same as at June 30, 1999.Economic Value Stress Testing. Chase utilizes several historical andhypothetical scenarios when performing its economic value stress tests. As ofJune 30, 2000, under the "1994 bond market sell-off" scenario, the potentialimpact on the economic value of Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activitieswould have been equivalent to less than 2% of Chase's market capitalization.IMPACT OF A/L DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY- ---------------------------------The following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's A/L activities at June 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999.(a) These net unrecognized losses do not include the net favorable impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.=============================================================================== -36-  37PART IItem 2 (continued)- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 51-53 and Note18 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.CAPITALChase's capital levels at June 30, 2000 remained strong, with capital ratioswell in excess of regulatory guidelines. At June 30, 2000, the Tier 1 and TotalCapital ratios were 8.7% and 12.4%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 6.8%. Management's long-term target range for the Tier 1 Capital ratio is8% to 8.25%; however, this target may not always be maintained on aquarter-to-quarter basis in light of changing economic conditions and businessneeds.The following table shows the sources and uses of Chase's Tier 1 Capital.During the first half of 2000, $0.9 billion of free cash flow was generated,which was primarily earmarked to support the acquisition of Flemings in August2000.Chase shareholders approved a three-for-two stock split at Chase's annualmeeting on May 16, 2000. The record date for the split was May 17, 2000 and theadditional shares of common stock issued as a result of the split weredistributed on June 9, 2000.Chase's dividend policy is to pay common stock dividends equal to approximately25% to 35% of Chase's operating earnings, less preferred stock dividends.Chase's future dividend policies will be determined by its Board of Directorsafter taking into consideration Chase's earnings and financial condition andapplicable government regulations and policies.Under its equity repurchase program, which became effective January 19, 2000,Chase may repurchase up to $5 billion of its common stock in the open market orthrough negotiated transactions, in addition to any amounts that may need to bepurchased to provide for issuances under Chase's dividend reinvestment plan andits various stock-based employee benefit plans. There were no repurchases ofChase common stock during the 2000 second quarter. Stock repurchases areplanned to resume after the Flemings acquisition is completed and Chase's Tier1 Capital ratio returns to management's target range of 8% to 8.25%, which isanticipated to occur by year-end 2000.At June 30, 2000, the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier2 Capital) was $38.0 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion from December 31,1999. This increase reflects retained earnings (net income less common andpreferred dividends) generated during the period, partially offset by commonstock repurchases in the first quarter of 2000, and the redemption of $100million of preferred stock.LIQUIDITYWhile capital is held to absorb losses over time, liquidity is managed to meetChase's known and unanticipated cash funding needs. Chase must maintainsufficient liquidity for operations, to meet payment demands on borrowings andto make new loans and investments as opportunities arise. During the first sixmonths of 2000, Chase issued $5.6 billion of long-term debt, while $1.7 billionof long-term debt matured. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2000, $100million of 10.96% cumulative preferred stock was redeemed. -37-  38PART IItem 2 (continued)- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's operating risk management focuses primarilyon developments since December 31, 1999 and should be read in conjunction withthe Operating Risk Management section on page 54 of the 1999 Annual Report.Chase is exposed to many types of operating risk, including the risk of fraudby employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, and errorsrelating to computer and telecommunications systems. In early 2000, Chaseestablished two additional risk-management committees, each of which reports toChase's Executive Committee: the Operating Risk Committee, which is currentlyreviewing the design of the control function within Chase, and the FiduciaryRisk Committee, which is responsible for approving Chase's policies forfiduciary risk.Chase maintains systems of controls that it believes are reasonably designed toprovide management and the Board of Directors with timely and accurateinformation about the operations of Chase. These systems have been designed tokeep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of Chase's financialstrength, the characteristics of its businesses and the markets in which itoperates, and the competitive and regulatory environment to which it issubject. However, Chase has suffered losses from operating risk from time totime, and there can be no assurance that Chase will not suffer such losses inthe future.Chase continues its reconciliation project relating to the deficienciesidentified in the computerized recordkeeping systems of the bond paying agencyfunction within Chase's Capital Markets Fiduciary Services Group. In connectionwith this project, Chase incurred some immaterial costs during the first halfof 2000. Management does not anticipate that Chase will incur any additionalmaterial costs related to this project. The Securities and Exchange Commissionis investigating the question of whether, in connection with this matter, therehave been violations of its transfer agency recordkeeping or reportingregulations and whether Chase's disclosure regarding these issues have beenadequate and timely.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-4 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $3.0 billion atJune 30, 2000.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------For a discussion of accounting developments related to derivatives and theallowance for loan losses, see the Accounting and Reporting Development sectionon page 55 of the 1999 Annual Report.- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER EVENTS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------On August 1, 2000 Chase acquired Flemings. The consideration issued to Flemings'shareholders consisted of 2.6 billion pound sterling and 65.3 million shares ofChase common stock. Chase and Flemings also have a retention arrangement for keyemployees in an aggregate amount of approximately $240 million (after-tax),which will be expensed over the two years following the acquisition. Flemings isa global asset management and investment banking firm based in London. Thetransaction was accounted for under the purchase method.Chase acquired The Beacon Group, LLC, a privately-held investment banking firm,on July 6, 2000. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method. -38-  39Part 1Item 2 (continued)(a) Based on annualized amounts.(b) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs and special items.(c) Includes provision for loan losses and credit costs related to the securitized credit card portfolio.(d) Cash Operating Earnings represent operating earnings excluding the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles.(e) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.NM Not meaningful.=============================================================================== -39-  40PART IItem 2 (continued) THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Consolidated Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the three months ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 5.84% and 5.61%, respectively.(c) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes.- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -40-  41Part 1Item 2 (continued) THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INTEREST AND RATES (TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST AND RATES; IN MILLIONS)- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------(a) Reflects a pro forma adjustment to the net interest income amount included in the Consolidated Statement of Income to permit comparisons of yields on tax-exempt and taxable assets.(b) For the six months ended June 30, 2000 and June 30, 1999, the annualized rate for available-for-sale securities based on historical cost was 5.83% and 5.69%, respectively.(c) Includes securities sold but not yet purchased and structured notes.- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -41-  42PART IItem 2 (continued) THE CHASE MANHATTAN CORPORATION QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) -42-  43Part 1Item 2 (continued)- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GLOSSARY OF TERMS- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------The page numbers included after each definition represent the pages in thisForm 10-Q where the term primarily is used.1999 Annual Report: Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,1999.
