>approximates fair value for the Firm's physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when market is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. For a further discussion of the Firm's hedge accounting relationships, see Note 5. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three and nine months ended&#32;September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2.During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, transfers from level 3 into level 2 included $3.4 billion&#32;and $3.1 billion&#32;of equity derivative receivables and payables, respectively, due to increased observability of certain equity option valuation inputs; and $1.1 billion&#32;of corporate debt, $1.1 billion&#32;of long-term debt and $1.0 billion&#32;of trading loans based on increased liquidity and price transparency. Transfers from level 2 into level 3 included $1.1 billion&#32;of other borrowed funds based on a decrease in observability of valuation inputs and price transparency.During the three months ended March 31, 2013, certain highly rated collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;), including $27.3 billion&#32;held in the Firm's AFS securities portfolio and $1.3 billion&#32;held in the trading portfolio, were transferred from level 3 to level 2, based on increased liquidity and price transparency.All transfers are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.Level 3 valuationsFor further information on the Firm's valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the Firm's primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable &nbsp;components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. The input range does not reflect the level of input uncertainty; instead it is driven by the different underlying characteristics of the various instruments within the classification. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices.Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm's view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm's estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter to parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.For the Firm's derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at September 30, 2014, the equity and interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while the credit correlation inputs were distributed across the range presented and the foreign exchange correlation inputs were concentrated at the lower end of the range presented. In addition, the interest rate volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were concentrated at the upper end of the range presented, while equity volatilities were concentrated at the lower end of the range. The forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated within the lower end of the range presented.99Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputsFor a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm's positions see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurementsThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the &nbsp;significance of the unobservable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.100101102103104Level 3 analysisConsolidated Balance Sheets changesLevel 3 assets (including assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 2.5%&#32;of total Firm assets at September 30, 2014. The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2013, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 106.Three months ended September 30, 2014Level 3 assets were $61.8 billion&#32;at September 30, 2014, reflecting an increase of $1.4 billion&#32;from June 30, 2014, largely due to the following:Nine months ended September 30, 2014Level 3 assets decreased by $7.5 billion&#32;during the nine months ended 2014, mainly due to the following:$1.1 billion&#32;increase in trading assets - debt and equity securities largely driven by an increase in trading loans and new client-driven financing transactions.&nbsp;Gains and losses&#32;The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. For further information on these instruments, see Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 100&#8211;105.Three months ended September 30, 2014Three months ended September 30, 2013Nine months ended September30, 2014 Nine months ended September 30, 2013105Credit & funding adjustmentsThe following table provides the credit and funding adjustments, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities, reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates indicated.The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on Principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. &nbsp;Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis At September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were $2.6 billion&#32;and $2.2 billion, respectively, which predominantly consisted of loans that had fair value adjustments for the nine months ended 2014 and 2013. At September 30, 2014, $102 million&#32;and $2.5 billion&#32;of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. At September 30, 2013, $161 million&#32;and $2.0&#160;billion&#32;of these assets were classified in levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy, respectively. Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were not significant at September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013. For the three and nine months ended&#32;September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013, there were no significant transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3.Of the $2.6 billion&#32;of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, $1.3 billion&#32;related to trade finance loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale during the fourth quarter of 2013 and subject to a lower of cost or fair value adjustment. These loans were classified as level 3, as they are valued based on the indicative pricing received from external investors, which ranged from a spread of 58&#32;bps to 70&#32;bps, with a weighted average of 60&#32;bps.At September 30, 2014, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis also included $675 million&#32;related to residential real estate loans measured at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., collateral-dependent loans and other loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using a broker's price opinion and discounted based upon the Firm's experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts to the broker price opinions ranged from 12%&#32;to 66%, with a weighted average of 27%.The total change in the recorded value of assets and liabilities for which a fair value adjustment has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013, related to financial instruments held at those dates, was a reduction of $280 million&#32;and $215 million, respectively; and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013, was a reduction of $709 million&#32;and $600 million.For information about the measurement of impaired collateral-dependent loans, and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral (e.g., residential mortgage loans charged off in accordance with regulatory guidance), see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.106Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair valueThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values at September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and information is provided on their classification within the fair value hierarchy. For additional information regarding the financial instruments within the scope of this disclosure, and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair value, see Note 3 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.107The majority of the Firm's lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, nor are they actively traded. The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Firm's wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. For a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments, see page 198 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Trading assets and liabilities &#8211; average balancesAverage trading assets and liabilities were as follows for the periods indicated.108Note 4 &#8211; Fair value option For a discussion of the primary financial instruments for which the fair value option was previously elected, including the basis for those elections and the determination of instrument-specific credit risk, where relevant, see Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Changes in fair value under the fair value option electionThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014&#32;and 2013, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.109Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstandingThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.At September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the contractual amount of letters of credit for which the fair value option was elected was $4.5 billion&#32;and $4.5 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(101) million&#32;and $(99) million, respectively. For further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, see Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report, and Note 21 of this Form 10-Q.Structured note products by balance sheet classification and risk componentThe table below presents the fair value of the structured notes issued by the Firm, by balance sheet classification and the primary risk to which the structured notes' embedded derivative relates.110Note 5 &#8211; Derivative instrumentsJPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for customers and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. For a further discussion of the Firm's use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The Firm's disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm's derivatives are designated in hedge &nbsp;accounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage certain risks associated with specified assets or liabilities (&#8220;specified risk management&#8221; positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firm's market-making businesses or for other purposes.The following table outlines the Firm's primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.111Notional amount of derivative contractsThe following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.While the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firm's derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firm's view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions. For most derivative transactions, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is used simply as a reference to calculate payments.112Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance SheetsThe following table summarizes information on derivative receivables and payables (before and after netting adjustments) that are reflected on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, by accounting designation (e.g., whether the derivatives were designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships or not) and contract type.113The following table presents, as of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013,&#160;the gross and net derivative receivables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative payables and cash collateral payables to the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the receivables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.114The following table presents, as of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013,&#160;the gross and net derivative payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative payables have been netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets against derivative receivables and cash collateral receivables from the same counterparty with respect to derivative contracts for which the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the payables are not eligible under U.S. GAAP for netting on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are shown separately in the table below.115In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with net derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm's derivative instruments but are not eligible for net presentation, because (a) the collateral is comprised of &nbsp;non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other G7 government bonds), (b) the amount of collateral held or transferred exceeds the fair value exposure, at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, or (c) the collateral relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained. The following tables present information regarding certain financial instrument collateral received and transferred as of September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, that is not eligible for net presentation under U.S. GAAP. The collateral included in these tables relates only to the derivative instruments for which appropriate legal opinions have been obtained; excluded are (i) additional collateral that exceeds the fair value exposure and (ii) all collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.&#32;Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent featuresFor a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firm's derivative contracts, see Note 6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.&nbsp;116The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.&#8221;), at September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral, except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade, or termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of IncomeThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.Fair value hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative and the related hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.117118Cash flow hedge gains and lossesThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative and the change in cash flows on the hedged item in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that $5 million&#32;(after-tax) of net gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) at September&#160;30, 2014, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 9 years, and such transactions primarily relate to core lending and borrowing activities.119Net investment hedge gains and lossesThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pretax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. Amounts related to excluded components are recorded in current-period income. The Firm measures the ineffectiveness of net investment hedge accounting relationships based on changes in spot foreign currency rates, and therefore there was no material ineffectiveness for net investment hedge accounting relationships during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified risk management purposesThe following table presents pretax gains/(losses) recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are used to manage risks associated with certain specified assets and liabilities, including certain risks arising from the mortgage pipeline, warehouse loans, MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, foreign currency-denominated liabilities, and commodities-related contracts and investments.&nbsp;Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivativesThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from the Firm's market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. These derivatives, as well as all other derivatives that are not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above, are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. See Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue. 120Credit derivativesThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm's view, the risks associated with such derivatives.Total credit derivatives and credit-related notesThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings and maturity profile, and the total fair value, of credit derivatives as of September&#160;30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, where JPMorgan Chase&#32;is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.121Note 6 &#8211; Noninterest revenueFor a discussion of the components of and accounting policies for the Firm's noninterest revenue, see Note 7 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm's client-driven market-making activities.&#160;See Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense. Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual line of business.&nbsp;The following table presents the components of firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.Other incomeIncluded in other income is operating lease income of $433 million&#32;and $376 million&#32;for the three months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively, and $1.3 billion&#32;and $1.1 billion&#32;for the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively.122Note 7 &#8211; Interest income and Interest expenseFor a description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding interest income and interest expense, see Note 8 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.Details of interest income and interest expense were as follows.123Note 8 &#8211; Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plansFor a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's pension and other postretirement employee benefit (&#8220;OPEB&#8221;) plans, see Note 9 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the Firm's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans.The fair values of plan assets for the U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans and for the material non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.5 billion&#32;and $3.7 billion, as of September 30, 2014, and $16.1 billion&#32;and $3.5 billion&#32;respectively, as of December 31, 2013. See Note 19 for further information on unrecognized amounts (i.e., net loss and prior service costs/(credit)) reflected in AOCI for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2014, and 2013.&nbsp;The Firm does not anticipate any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2014&#32;at this time. For 2014, the cost associated with funding benefits under the Firm's U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plans is expected to total $37 million. The 2014&#32;contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are expected to be $49 million&#32;and $2 million, respectively.124Note 9 &#8211; Employee stock-based incentivesFor a discussion of the accounting policies and other information relating to employee stock-based incentives, see Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee stock-based incentive plans in its Consolidated Statements of Income.In the first quarter of 2014, in connection with its annual incentive grant for the 2013 performance year, the Firm granted 36 million&#32;RSUs with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $57.87&#32;per RSU.Separately, on July 15, 2014, the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors determined that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer had met all requirements for the vesting of the 2 million&#32;SAR awards originally issued in January 2008 and thus, the awards have become exercisable. The SARs, which will expire in January 2018, have an exercise price of $39.83&#32;(the price of JPMorgan Chase common stock on the date of issuance).&nbsp;Note 10 &#8211; Noninterest expenseThe following table presents the components of noninterest expense.125Note 11 &#8211; SecuritiesSecurities are classified as AFS, HTM or trading. Securities classified as trading are discussed in Note 3. Predominantly all of the Firm's AFS and HTM investment securities (the &#8220;investment securities portfolio&#8221;) are held by Treasury and Chief Investment Office (&#8220;CIO&#8221;) in connection with its asset-liability management objectives. At both September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, the average credit rating of the debt securities comprising the investment securities portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings which correspond to ratings as defined by S&P and Moody's). For additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio, see Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.During the first quarter of 2014, the Firm transferred U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities and obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a fair value of $19.3 billion&#32;from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value. Accumulated other comprehensive income included net pretax unrealized losses of $9 million&#32;on the securities at the date of transfer. The transfers reflect the Firm's intent to hold the securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures under Basel III.&nbsp;Realized gains and lossesThe following table presents realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment losses (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;) from AFS securities that were recognized in income.The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.126Securities impairmentThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.127Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securitiesThe following table presents a rollforward for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, of the credit loss component of OTTI losses that have been recognized in income related to AFS debt securities that the Firm does not intend to sell.Gross unrealized lossesGross unrealized losses have generally decreased since December 31, 2013. Though losses on securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more have increased, the increase is not material. The Firm has recognized the unrealized losses on securities it intends to sell. As of September 30, 2014, the Firm does not intend to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, and it is not likely that the Firm will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Except for the securities noted above for which credit losses have been recognized in income, the Firm believes that the securities in an unrealized loss position are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2014.128Contractual maturities and yieldsThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at September 30, 2014, of JPMorgan Chase's investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.129Note 12 &#8211; Securities financing activitiesFor a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities, see Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report. For further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the &nbsp;fair value option has been elected, see Note 4. For further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements, see Note 22.The following table presents as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the gross and net securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed. Securities purchased under resale agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities sold under repurchase agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities purchased under resale agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities borrowed are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table presents information as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, regarding the securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement.&#160;The table below excludes information related to resale agreements and securities borrowed where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.130The following table presents as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the gross and net securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned. Securities sold under repurchase agreements have been presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of securities purchased under resale agreements where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement, and where the other relevant criteria have been met. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities sold under repurchase agreements are not eligible for netting and are shown separately in the table below. Securities loaned are presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The following table presents information as of September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, regarding the securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned for which an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained with respect to the master netting agreement.&#160;The table below excludes information related to repurchase agreements and securities loaned where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained.Transfers not qualifying for sale accountingAt September 30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm held $13.5 billion&#32;and $14.6 billion, respectively, of financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. &nbsp;The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets, other assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded in other borrowed funds, and accounts payable and other liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.131Note 13 &#8211; LoansLoan accounting frameworkThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:&nbsp;For a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report. See Note 4 of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. See Note 3 of this Form 10-Q&#32;for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.Loan portfolioThe Firm's loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment, the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class:132The following tables summarize the Firm's loan balances by portfolio segment.The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. These tables exclude loans recorded at fair value.&#32;The Firm manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that the Firm reduces its credit exposures.The following table provides information about gains/(losses) on loan sales by portfolio segment.133Consumer, excluding credit card loan portfolioConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business banking loans, and student and other loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans originated by Washington Mutual that may result in negative amortization.The table below provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.For further information on consumer credit quality indicators, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loansThe following table provides information by class for residential real estate &#8211; excluding retained PCI loans in the consumer, excluding credit card, portfolio segment.The following factors should be considered in analyzing certain credit statistics applicable to the Firm's residential real estate &#8211; excluding PCI loans portfolio: (i) junior lien home equity loans may be fully charged off when the loan becomes 180 days&#32;past due, and the value of the collateral does not support the repayment of the loan, resulting in relatively high charge-off rates for this product class; and (ii) the lengthening of loss-mitigation timelines may result in higher delinquency rates for loans carried at the net realizable value of the collateral that remain on the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets.134135The following tables represent the Firm's delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.(a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a 20-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs originated by Washington Mutual that require interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the collateral does not support the loan amount.Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) beyond the revolving period and home equity loans (&#8220;HELOANs&#8221;) have higher delinquency rates than do HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options &nbsp;available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into the loss estimates produced by the Firm's delinquency roll-rate methodology, which estimates defaults based on the current delinquency status of a portfolio.Impaired loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14.136The following tables present average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by the Firm.Loan modificationsThe Firm is required to provide &#8220;borrower relief&#8221; under the terms of certain Consent Orders and settlements entered into by the Firm related to its mortgage servicing, originations and residential mortgage-backed securities activities. This &#8220;borrower relief&#8221; includes reductions of principal and forbearance. For further information on these Consent Orders and settlements, see Business changes and developments in Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.&nbsp;Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There are no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.137TDR activity rollforwardThe following tables reconcile the beginning and ending balances of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, modified in TDRs for the periods presented.Nature and extent of modificationsMaking Home Affordable (&#8220;MHA&#8221;), as well as the Firm's proprietary modification programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term &nbsp;or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.138The following tables provide information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs during the periods presented. These tables exclude Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt. At September&#160;30, 2014, there were approximately 34,000&#32;of such Chapter 7 loans, consisting of approximately 8,200&#32;senior lien home equity loans, 20,900&#32;junior lien home equity loans, 2,800&#32;prime mortgage, including option ARMs, and 2,100&#32;subprime mortgages.139Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following tables provide information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the Firm's loss mitigation programs and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. Because the specific types and amounts of concessions offered to borrowers frequently change between the trial modification and the permanent modification, the following tables present only the financial effects of permanent modifications. These tables also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.Approximately 85%&#32;of the trial modifications approved on or after July 1, 2010 (the approximate date on which substantial revisions were made to the Home Affordable Modification Program (&#8220;HAMP&#8221;) program), that are seasoned more than six months have been successfully converted to permanent modifications.&nbsp;The primary performance indicator for TDRs is the rate at which permanently modified loans redefault. At September&#160;30, 2014, the cumulative redefault rates of residential real estate loans that have been modified under the Firm's loss mitigation programs, excluding PCI loans, based upon permanent modifications that were completed 140after October 1, 2009, and that are seasoned more than six months, are 19%&#32;for senior lien home equity, 21%&#32;for junior lien home equity, 16%&#32;for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 28%&#32;for subprime mortgages.Default rates of Chapter 7 loans vary significantly based on the delinquency status of the loan and overall economic conditions at the time of discharge.&#160;Default rates for Chapter 7 residential real estate loans that were less than 60 days&#32;past due at the time of discharge have ranged between approximately 10%&#32;and 40%&#32;in recent years based on the economic conditions at the time of discharge. At September&#160;30, 2014, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately 18%&#32;of senior lien home equity, 11%&#32;of junior lien home equity, 26%&#32;of prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 17%&#32;of subprime mortgages that were 30 days&#32;or more past due.&nbsp;At September&#160;30, 2014, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were 6&#32;years for senior lien home equity, 7&#32;years for junior lien home equity, 10&#32;years for prime mortgages, including option ARMs, and 8&#32;years for subprime mortgages. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).Active and suspended foreclosureAt September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm had non-PCI residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $1.6 billion&#32;and $2.1 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.Other consumer loansThe table below provides information for other consumer retained loan classes, including auto, business banking and student loans.141Other consumer impaired loans and loan modificationsThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's other consumer impaired loans, including risk-rated business banking and auto loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status, and loans that have been modified in TDRs.Loan modificationsThe following table provides information about the Firm's other consumer loans modified in TDRs. All of these TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above.TDR activity rollforwardThe following tables reconcile the beginning and ending balances of other consumer loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented.&nbsp;Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsFor auto loans, TDRs typically occur in connection with the bankruptcy of the borrower. In these cases, the loan is modified with a revised repayment plan that typically incorporates interest rate reductions and, to a lesser extent, principal forgiveness.For business banking loans, concessions are dependent on individual borrower circumstances and can be of a short-term nature for borrowers who need temporary relief or longer term for borrowers experiencing more fundamental financial difficulties. Concessions are predominantly term or payment extensions, but also may include interest rate reductions.The balance of business banking loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, was $4 million&#32;and $10 million&#32;during the three months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively, and $18 million&#32;and $33 million&#32;during the nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively. The balance of auto loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default, and for which the payment default occurred within one year&#32;of the modification, was $11 million&#32;and $13 million&#32;during the three months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively and $33 million&#32;and $41 million&#32;during the nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, respectively. A payment default is deemed to occur as follows: (1) for scored auto and business banking loans, when the loan is two&#32;payments past due; and (2) for risk-rated business banking loans and auto loans, when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to the contractual grace period, if any.In May 2014 the Firm began extending the deferment period for up to 24 months for certain student loans, which resulted in extending the maturity of the loans at their original contractual interest rates. These modified loans are considered TDRs and placed on nonaccrual status.142Purchased credit-impaired loansFor a detailed discussion of PCI loans, including the related accounting policies, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Residential real estate &#8211; PCI loansThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's consumer, excluding credit card, PCI loans.143Approximately 20%&#32;of the PCI home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following tables set forth delinquency statistics for PCI junior lien home equity loans and lines of credit based on unpaid principal balance as of September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013.The table below sets forth the accretable yield activity for the Firm's PCI consumer loans for the three and nine months ended&#32;September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, and represents the Firm's estimate of gross interest income expected to be earned over the remaining life of the PCI loan portfolios. The table excludes the cost to fund the PCI portfolios, and therefore the accretable yield does not represent net interest income expected to be earned on these portfolios.The factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield balance, include: (i) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products such as option ARM and home equity loans; and (ii) changes in prepayment assumptions.&nbsp;Active and suspended foreclosureAt September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, the Firm had PCI residential real estate loans with an unpaid principal balance of $3.5 billion&#32;and $4.8 billion, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.144Credit card loan portfolioThe table below sets forth information about the Firm's credit card loans.Credit card impaired loans and loan modificationsFor a detailed discussion of impaired credit card loans, including credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's impaired credit card loans. All of these loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in TDRs.&nbsp;At September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, $170 million&#32;and $226 million, respectively, of loans have reverted back to the pre-modification payment terms of the loans due to noncompliance with the terms of the modified loans. The remaining $104 million&#32;and $143 million&#32;at September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, respectively, of these loans are to borrowers who have successfully completed a short-term modification program. The Firm continues to report these loans as TDRs since the borrowers' credit lines remain closed.The following table presents average balances of impaired credit card loans and interest income recognized on those loans.Loan modificationsThe Firm may modify loans to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of these loans have been modified under programs that involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a reduced interest rate, generally for 60 months. All of these credit card loan modifications are considered to be TDRs.&#160;New enrollments in these loan modification programs for the three months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, were $196 million&#32;and $288 million, respectively and for the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, were $622 million&#32;and $915 million, respectively.&#160;For additional information about credit card loan modifications, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented.For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the loans become two&#32;payments past due. A substantial portion of these loans is expected to be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. Based on historical experience, the estimated weighted-average default rate was expected to be 28.31%&#32;and 30.72%&#32;for credit card loans modified as of September&#160;30, 2014, and December&#160;31, 2013, respectively.145Wholesale loan portfolioWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the risk rating &nbsp;assigned each loan. For further information on these risk ratings, see Note 14 and Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.The table below provides information by class of receivable for the retained loans in the Wholesale portfolio segment.The following table presents additional information on the real estate class of loans within the Wholesale portfolio segment for the periods indicated. For further information on real estate loans, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.146Wholesale impaired loans and loan modificationsWholesale impaired loans are comprised of loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and/or that have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note 14.The table below sets forth information about the Firm's wholesale impaired loans.The following table presents the Firm's average impaired loans for the periods indicated.147Loan modificationsCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. All TDRs are reported as impaired loans in the tables above. For further information, see Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.The following table provides information about the Firm's wholesale loans that have been modified in TDRs, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of such loans and information regarding the nature and extent of modifications during the periods presented.Financial effects of modifications and redefaultsWholesale loans modified as TDRs are typically term or payment extensions and, to a lesser extent, deferrals of principal and/or interest on commercial and industrial and real estate loans. For the three months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 1.1&#32;and 6.0&#32;years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 1.4&#32;years and 3.1&#32;years, respectively. There were no&#32;wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended September&#160;30, 2014. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the three months ended September&#160;30, 2013 was zero.&nbsp;For the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2014&#32;and 2013, the average term extension granted on wholesale loans with term or payment extensions was 1.1&#32;years and 2.1&#32;years, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term for all loans modified during these periods was 2.5&#32;years and 1.6&#32;years, respectively. There were no&#32;wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2014. Wholesale TDR loans that redefaulted within one year of the modification during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $1 million. A payment default is deemed to occur when the borrower has not made a loan payment by its scheduled due date after giving effect to any contractual grace period.148Note 14 &#8211; Allowance for credit lossesFor detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies, see Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013&#32;Annual Report.Allowance for credit losses and loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodologyThe table below summarizes information about the allowance for loan losses, loans by impairment methodology, the allowance for lending-related commitments and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.149Note 15 &#8211; Variable interest entitiesFor a further description of JPMorgan Chase's accounting policies regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;), see Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties, as described on page 153 of this Note.Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entitiesCredit card securitizationsFor a more detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.As a result of the Firm's continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts. This includes the Firm's primary card securitization trust, Chase Issuance Trust. See the table on page 154&#32;of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.&nbsp;Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trustsThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans (including automobile and student loans) primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interest in the securitization trusts.For a detailed discussion of the Firm's involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts, see Note 16 of JPMorgan Chase's 2013 Annual Report.150<hr
