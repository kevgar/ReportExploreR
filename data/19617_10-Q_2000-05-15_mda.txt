 11Part IItem 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS(a) Operating basis excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs and special items. For a further discussion, see Glossary of Terms on page 35.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================Chase's diluted earnings per share were $1.59 in the first quarter, on both areported and operating basis, 20% higher than the $1.32 per share, on a reportedand operating basis, in the first quarter of 1999. Operating earnings andreported net income in the first quarter of 2000 were each $1.36 billion,compared with $1.17 billion in the first quarter of 1999. Diluted cash earningsper share increased 20% to $1.69 in the first quarter, compared with $1.41 inthe first quarter of 1999.Operating highlights for first quarter of 2000 included: - Global Bank's cash operating earnings increased 19% - Global Services rebounded with 39% cash operating earnings growth - Return on common equity was 24% - Dividend was raised 17% - Repurchased $675 million of common stock, on a net basis, while Tier 1 Capital ratio rose to 8.6% - Announced three-for-two stock split, subject to shareholder approvalThe strong 2000 first quarter results continued to demonstrate the strength anddiversity of the Chase franchise. Chase continued its disciplined approach tomaking investments designed to propel its future growth, especially the growthopportunities presented by the New Economy and the rapidly changing globaleconomy.DIVERSE FRANCHISE: During the 2000 first quarter, Global Bank had 19% growth incash operating earnings and 26% growth in operating revenue, when compared withthe 1999 first quarter, reflecting strong results in all businesses. GlobalServices' operating revenues were $851 million, a 17% increase over the prioryear's first quarter, reflecting strong growth in Chase's securities processingbusinesses. National Consumer Services ("NCS") had operating revenues of $2.4billion, which were relatively flat when compared with the 1999 first quarter.Improved results from NCS' regional banking, middle market banking, retailinvestment business and mortgage finance business were not enough to offsetpressures on credit card margins due to rising interest rates and a $100 millionreduction in auto finance's interest income to address exposure to potentiallosses on future auto lease terminations. -11-  12FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE: Chase seeks to manage its businesses with strict financialdiscipline with attention to risk, capital and expense management. Credit costsdecreased 8% from the 1999 first quarter, while nonperforming assets at March31, 2000 were $1.70 billion and remained low as a percentage of total assets.SVA continued to restrain growth in risk-weighted assets without impeding growthin income. As a result, Chase repurchased $675 million of its common stock on anet basis during the 2000 first quarter, while its Tier 1 Capital ratioincreased to 8.6%.Total operating noninterest expenses increased 19% in the first quarter of 2000,with the growth in expenses supporting revenue growth. A significant portion ofthe expense growth was due to higher incentives related to revenue increases inglobal banking businesses and to the acquisition of Hambrecht & Quist ("H&Q") inthe fourth quarter of 1999. Chase continues to be committed to managing therelationship between its expense and revenue growth.INVESTING FOR GROWTH: One of Chase's strategic priorities is investing forgrowth - a willingness to use its resources to strengthen its competitivenesswhere it has leadership positions. A recent example is the announcement on April11, 2000 that Chase had agreed to terms for an offer for Robert Fleming HoldingsLtd. ("Flemings"), a global asset management and investment banking firm. SeeOther Events on page 31 for a further discussion on Flemings.This Management's Discussion and Analysis contains certain forward-lookingstatements. Those forward-looking statements are subject to risks anduncertainties, and Chase's actual results may differ from those statements. SeeChase's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particularthe 1999 Annual Report, for a discussion of factors that may cause suchdifferences to occur. See Glossary of Terms on page 35 for a definition of termsused throughout this Form 10-Q.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------RESULTS OF OPERATIONS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following section provides a discussion of Chase's results of operations asreported in its financial statements as well as on an operating basis.Management categorizes its revenue components as either market-sensitive or lessmarket-sensitive. For a further discussion of management's performancemeasurements, see page 20 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.The following table provides a reconciliation between Chase's reported financialstatements and as presented on an operating basis.(a) Represents the amounts that are reported in Chase's financial statements. The only exception is that revenues are categorized between market-sensitive and less market-sensitive revenues.(b) This column excludes the impact of credit card securitizations. For securitized receivables, amounts that previously would have been reported as net interest income and as provision for loan losses instead are reported as components of noninterest revenue.================================================================================ -12-  13MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUESMarket-sensitive revenues are derived from Chase's extensive Global Bankfranchise. These revenues typically are more sensitive to global market factorsthan those produced by other Chase businesses. In the first quarter of 2000,total market-sensitive revenues were 35% higher than in first quarter of 1999and were approximately $445 million above Chase's current trendline. For afurther discussion of Chase's market-sensitive revenues, including the relatedtrendline, see pages 21-23 of the 1999 Annual Report.INVESTMENT BANKING FEESInvestment banking fees increased to $648 million, a 104% increase from thefirst quarter of 1999. Revenues in the 2000 first quarter reflect strongunderwriting fees at Chase H&Q, a doubling of the amount of merger andacquisition advisory fees compared with the first quarter of 1999 and a 39%increase in syndication fees. On a pro forma basis, if Chase had owned Hambrecht& Quist since the beginning of 1999, the growth rate of investment banking feeswould have been 69% when compared with the first quarter of 1999. These strongresults reflect Chase's ability to leverage its broad customer base, strongdistribution network and leadership positions in an attractive financial marketenvironment.TRADING-RELATED REVENUETotal trading revenues, including related net interest income, rose 25% to $1.05billion, a new record, benefiting from strong results in all business segments,including foreign exchange ("FX"), international fixed income products,market-making activity in emerging markets, equity derivatives and equitytrading at Chase H&Q.(a) Charge-offs for risk management instruments are included in trading revenue.(b) Trading-related net interest income includes interest recognized on interest-earning and interest-bearing trading-related positions as well as management allocations, reflecting the funding cost or benefit associated with trading positions. This amount is included in net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.(c) Includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate futures and options, forward rate agreements and related hedges.(d) Includes foreign exchange spot and option contracts.(e) Includes equity securities, equity derivatives, commodities and commodity derivatives.(f) Includes U.S. and foreign government agency securities, corporate debt instruments, emerging markets debt instruments, debt-related derivatives and credit derivatives.================================================================================Revenue from interest rate contracts, although decreasing slightly from lastyear's first quarter, remained strong. Foreign exchange revenue in the firstquarter 2000 increased $80 million to $279 million due to increased volatilityin foreign markets. Equities and commodities revenue increased 171% in the 2000first quarter, in large part as a result of equity trading at Chase H&Q. Thedebt instruments and other category recorded strong revenue of $235 million forthe first quarter resulting from market-making and client activities in emergingmarkets and the U.S. fixed income market. -13-  14SECURITIES GAINSSecurities investments primarily include liquid securities held in connectionwith Chase's treasury activities. Chase's domestic and international treasuryunits manage Chase's asset and liability interest rate risk. Securities gainsrealized in the first quarter 2000 were $14 million, compared with $156 millionin the same period in the prior year. The decline was due to the continuingincrease in market interest rates since early last year, which has lowered thevalue of these securities.PRIVATE EQUITY GAINSPrivate equity gains largely result from the business of Chase Capital Partners("CCP"), one of the world's largest and most diversified private equityinvestors, and Chase H&Q. Private equity-related investment gains in the firstquarter of 2000 were $500 million, up 54% from $325 million in the first quarterof 1999. First quarter revenues are the result of sales of securities in boththe private and public portfolio, appreciation in market values of publiccompanies, and revaluations of portfolio investments resulting from initialpublic offerings. In the first quarter, $341 million of total revenues were fromgains realized through sales versus $426 million in the first quarter of 1999.The level of investments has continued to grow. Direct equity investments were$1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2000, compared with $340 million for thesame 1999 period. The growth of direct equity investments, and a stock marketreceptive to technology and telecommunications stocks, contributed to the strongfirst quarter 2000 results.Beginning in April 2000, the quoted market value of the publicly tradedsecurities held in Chase's portfolio declined. The carrying values of Chase'sinterest in these securities that are recorded on its financial statements arenet of interests of investors other than Chase (i.e., participations and thirdparty investors), and reflect the liquidity discounts applied by Chase on thesesecurities. In addition, approximately 72% of the carrying value of theportfolio consists of privately held securities generally carried at cost, whichin management's judgment approximates fair value. The recent volatility in theprices of NASDAQ-listed securities had no impact on the carrying value of thisportion of the portfolio.Chase believes that equity-related investments will continue to make substantialcontributions to its earnings over time. However, given the volatile nature ofthe equity markets, and that of the NASDAQ-market in particular, Chase'sreported private-equity results in any given quarter, including itsmark-to-market gains or losses on publicly-traded securities, could be highlyvariable.The table below shows the direct and fund investment components of Chase'sportfolio, totaling $10.4 billion at March 31, 2000. In addition, Chase manages$8.5 billion of leveraged loan/high-yield funds and investments in other equityand asset funds, bringing total funds under management to $18.9 billion.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERS AND CHASE H&Q INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOFor a further discussion of CCP's business, visit the CCP web site at:www.chasecapital.com. -14-  15LESS MARKET-SENSITIVE REVENUELess market-sensitive revenues derive largely from Chase's extensive domesticconsumer banking activities, global services and global private bankingfranchises and from credit products provided to large corporate and middlemarket clients. These revenues generally experience less market volatility thanthose global banking revenues which are characterized as market-sensitive.Less market-sensitive revenues increased by 5% in the 2000 first quarter,reflecting increases in trust, custody and investment management fees and feesfor other financial services. These increases were partially offset by adecrease in other revenue and net interest income ("NII"). For a furtherdiscussion of less market-sensitive revenues, see pages 24-26 of Chase's 1999Annual Report.(a) Presented on an operating basis.NET INTEREST INCOMELess market-sensitive NII on an operating basis adjusts reported NII to reflectthe impact of credit card securitizations and the trading-related NII that isconsidered part of market-sensitive revenue. The following table reconcilesreported NII and less market-sensitive operating NII.(a) Disclosed on a taxable equivalent basis.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================For the 2000 first quarter, reported NII and operating NII declined $243 million(or 11%) and $47 million (or 2%), respectively, when compared with the 1999first quarter. Reported NII was adversely affected by a $195 million decline intrading-related NII as earning assets held to support Chase's trading businessesyielded minimal net interest income (see Trading-Related Revenue on page 13).Also, affecting both reported and operating NII in the 2000 first quarter was a$100 million decrease in estimated auto lease residual value, which wasaccounted for as a reduction in net interest income. This adjustment inestimated auto residuals addressed exposure to potential losses on maturingleases as a result of a decline in the market value of autos returned by lesseesat lease termination. -15-  16Managed interest-earning assets increased 4% over the 1999 first quarter due tohigher amounts of liquid assets, domestic consumer loans (primarily residentialmortgages and auto financings) and domestic commercial loans. This increase waspartially offset by a decline in the foreign commercial loan portfolio, as Chasereduced its exposure to emerging markets throughout 1999.The net yield on a managed basis was 3.38%, a decrease of 24 basis points incomparison with 1999, due to generally narrower spreads on loans (notably creditcards), a reflection of the rising interest rate environment and the impact ofthe aforementioned charge for auto lease residual values. Additionally, as aresult of a decrease in the volume of interest-free funds (noninterest-bearingfunds which support interest-earning assets), interest-free funds contributed 50basis points to the net yield in the first quarter of 2000, compared with 62basis points in the first quarter of 1999.TRUST, CUSTODY AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEESTrust, custody and investment management fees, which are generated by each ofthe three major franchises, rose to $509 million in the first quarter of 2000, a23% increase over the 1999 first quarter. These favorable results wereattributable to growth in the value of securities under management, thecontribution of Chase H&Q and internally generated growth in the personal andmutual funds businesses.(a) Represents fees for trustee, agency, registrar, securities-lending and broker clearing, custody and maintenance of securities.(b) Represents fees for trustee, estate, custody, advisory and investment management services.(c) Represents investment management, administrative, custody and other fees in connection with Chase's proprietary global mutual funds.================================================================================The following table shows the growth in Chase's assets under custody and undermanagement.CREDIT CARD REVENUECredit card revenues include interchange income, late fees, cash advances, andannual and overlimit fees as well as servicing fees associated withsecuritization activities. Credit card revenue on an operating basis remainedflat, while on a reported basis increased 5% for the first quarter of 2000. Thehigher revenues on a reported basis were due to increased customer usage,partially offset by lower late fees as a result of improved credit quality.The following table reconciles Chase's reported credit card revenue andoperating credit card revenue, which excludes the impact of credit cardsecuritizations. -16-  17FEES FOR OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICESFees for other financial services in the first quarter of 2000 increased 32%,when compared with the same period in the prior year, to $731 million. The tablebelow provides the significant components of fees for other financial services.MORTGAGE SERVICING FEES increased by 131% in the first quarter of 2000 versusthe first quarter of 1999, due to a larger servicing portfolio and a loweramortization rate on mortgage servicing rights. The servicing portfolioincreased 44% from last year's first quarter due to lower prepayments and theacquisition of the mortgage business from Mellon Bank Corporation in the thirdquarter of 1999. During the first quarter of 2000, mortgage interest ratesincreased, which resulted in lower prepayments of mortgage loans and, as aresult, lowered the amortization rate of mortgage servicing rights.BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES rose $64 million or 149% for the first quarter2000, compared with the same period in 1999. The increase was due to asignificant increase in customer activity at Brown & Company and the acquisitionof H&Q in the fourth quarter of 1999.SERVICE CHARGES ON DEPOSITS increased 11% during the first quarter of 2000,reflecting benefits of selected pricing initiatives.INSURANCE FEES include fees from credit-related products (such as insuring thepayment of credit card and auto loans in the event of loss of life, disabilityand other catastrophic events) as well as from non-credit-related products (suchas life, health and property insurance, and annuities). In the 2000 firstquarter, insurance fees were 26% higher than the 1999 first quarter, primarilydue to higher annuity sales and new business relating to mortgage, life andhealth insurance.OTHER REVENUEThe lower revenue from RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE ACTIVITIES (which includeorigination and sales of loans and selective dispositions of mortgage servicingrights) in the 2000 first quarter versus the same period in the prior year wasdue to higher interest rates, resulting in lower origination volumes and loansales.The increase in operating ALL OTHER REVENUE was a result of increased revenuesfrom auto operating leases and a gain on the sale of a nonstrategic asset. Theseincreases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from the OctagonInvestment Fund (which was established in early 1998 and was substantially soldto investors in late 1999), and lower gains from the sale of student loans in2000. -17-  18NONINTEREST EXPENSETotal noninterest expenses were $3.49 billion in the first quarter of 2000, a19% increase over the 1999 first quarter, reflecting higher incentives relatedto revenue increases in global banking businesses and to the acquisition of H&Qin the fourth quarter of 1999. On a pro forma basis, if Chase had owned H&Q forall of 1999, expense growth would have been 14%. Management of Chase intends tomanage operating noninterest expense to support revenue growth.(a) Excludes costs associated with the REIT and the impact of credit card securitizations.(b) Excludes the impact of amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles.================================================================================SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITSThe higher level of salaries and employee benefits was due to higher incentivecosts, primarily driven by the growth in market-sensitive revenues. Alsocontributing to the increase was the net addition of 1,041 full-time equivalentemployees. The increased headcount reflected the H&Q acquisition, an acquisitionin the mortgage business and the impact of internal growth in selectedbusinesses. These increases were partially offset by staff reductions related toinitiatives to streamline support functions and realign certain businessactivities.OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSEOccupancy expense increased slightly in the 2000 first quarter, primarily due tohigher occupancy costs resulting from business expansion and acquisitionsoccurring in 1999. The higher equipment expense for the 2000 first quarterreflects depreciation expense from the capitalization of costs related to moreadvanced hardware systems used in all businesses.OTHER EXPENSE(a) Includes REIT minority interest expense of $11 million in each quarter.================================================================================ -18-  19PROFESSIONAL SERVICES costs increased $9 million, reflecting higher managementconsulting costs incurred as a result of the expansion of Chase's internetbusinesses. Chase's spending on its technology initiatives during the 2000 firstquarter more than offset reduced technology expenditures as a result of thecompletion of Chase's Y2K efforts. MARKETING EXPENSE decreased $14 million,primarily as a result of the timing of various advertising programs.TELECOMMUNICATIONS expense increased $14 million, reflecting increasedinstallation and usage stemming from growth in business volume at all of Chase'smajor franchises (including Chase H&Q). AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increaseddue to the acquisitions in 1999 (in particular H&Q). TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENTexpense increased $12 million, reflecting higher costs at both domestic andoverseas units and the impact of Chase H&Q. ALL OTHER EXPENSE included increasesin processing volume at Chase Cardmember Services, the impact of Chase H&Q, andhigher domestic relocation and recruitment costs.CREDIT COSTSCredit costs include credit losses related to Chase's securitized credit cardloans. The following table shows the components of credit costs.Credit costs in the 2000 first quarter were $596 million, a decrease of $54million from the 1999 level, primarily due to lower credit losses in the creditcard portfolio and the impact of lower commercial charge-offs.INCOME TAXESChase recognized income tax expense of $733 million in the first quarter of2000, compared with $645 million in the first quarter of 1999. The effective taxrates were 35.0% and 35.5%, respectively. The continued improvement in theeffective tax rate was the result of the positive effects of tax planninginitiatives. -19-  20- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINES OF BUSINESS RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basis forChase's three major business franchises.

Through its presence in more than 45 countries, the GlobalBank serves an extensive array of clients, from large corporations withlong-standing global relationships to a growing franchise of clients in thefastest growing sectors of the New Economy.Cash operating earnings in the first quarter of 2000 were up 19% from the firstquarter of 1999. Operating revenues and Shareholder Value Added were up 26% and21%, respectively, from the first quarter of 1999, reflecting strong results inall businesses.

The following discussion focuses on the2000 first quarter financial highlights of each business.GLOBAL MARKETSOperating revenues, while down slightly from the 1999 first quarter, remainedstrong during the 2000 first quarter as total trading revenues, includingrelated net interest income, rose 25% to $1.05 billion, a new record, offset bylower securities gains. Cash operating earnings decreased 13% in the 2000 firstquarter, due to higher incentives and lower securities gains.The treasury businesses are managed through a "total return" discipline, whichmeasures economic value-added by capturing both realized income (securitiesgains and net interest income) and unrealized gains or losses on assets andliabilities. The total return (pre-tax before expenses) from the interest raterisk management activities of the treasury units amounted to $226 million forthe first quarter 2000, compared with $251 million for the same period in 1999.CHASE CAPITAL PARTNERSOperating revenues and cash operating earnings increased 17% and 12%,respectively, in the 2000 first quarter as a result of the strength in theequity markets for recent initial public offerings of telecommunicationcompanies and the positive impact of maturing investments within the portfolio.GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKINGRevenues and cash operating earnings for Global Investment Bank increasedsubstantially in the 2000 first quarter when compared with the 1999 firstquarter, reflecting a strong equity underwriting business at Chase H&Q,significant growth in mergers and acquisitions advisory activities and a 39%increase in syndication fees.CORPORATE LENDING AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENTCorporate Lending and Portfolio Management provides credit and lending servicesto clients globally utilizing a strategy that emphasizes loan origination fordistribution. Revenues and cash operating earnings remained flat in the firstquarter of 2000, when compared with the same period in 1999, as a result of theeffect of lower average loan levels (due to securitizations) offset by higherlending-related fees and marginally higher loan spreads.GLOBAL PRIVATE BANKGlobal Private Bank revenues, including Executive Financial Services at ChaseH&Q, increased to $331 million, a 58% increase from the same period a year ago,and on a pro forma basis (including H&Q's 1999 first quarter results) a 41%increase over the 1999 first quarter. -21-  22NATIONAL CONSUMER SERVICESNational Consumer Services serves 32 million customers nationwide offering awide variety of financial products and services through a diverse array ofdistribution channels. NCS is focused on delivering financial solutions toconsumers, as well as middle market and small businesses across the U.S.Financial solutions are delivered to consumers through distribution channelsthat include branch and ATM networks, internet banking, telephone and directmail.Operating revenues of $2.4 billion for NCS were flat when compared with thefirst quarter of 1999. Cash operating earnings declined 12% from the same perioda year ago. Strong results in regional banking, middle market banking and theretail investment business plus solid performance in mortgage finance were notenough to offset pressures on credit card margins due to rising interest ratesand a $100 million decrease in auto lease residual value, which was accountedfor as a reduction in net interest income.Results for NCS over the remainder of 2000 are expected to reflect the benefitsof expense management, good credit quality and moderating revenue growth.However, after taking into account NCS' operating results for the first quarterof 2000, management currently believes that it is unlikely that NCS will achieveits target of double-digit earnings growth for full year 2000.The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures of thebusinesses within NCS.NM Not meaningful.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================For a discussion of the profiles for each business within NCS, see page 33 ofChase's 1999 Annual Report. The following discussion focuses on the 2000 firstquarter financial highlights of each business.CHASE CARDMEMBER SERVICESCash operating earnings for Cardmember Services decreased 7% in the firstquarter. Revenues declined 4% reflecting reduced net interest spreads due torising interest rates and a lower level of late and overlimit fees, partlyoffset by higher consumer purchase volume. Credit quality improved, driven bylower bankruptcy filings and delinquencies, while expenses were higher due toinvestments in e-commerce and technology.REGIONAL BANKING GROUPRegional Banking Group revenues were $626 million, a 10% increase from the firstquarter of 1999. Cash operating earnings grew by 24%, reflecting significantlyhigher deposit volumes, particularly in the small business sector, the benefitfrom higher interest rates and growth in debit card volume.CHASE HOME FINANCEHome Finance revenues increased to $324 million, a 17% increase from firstquarter of 1999, and cash operating earnings rose 4%, primarily as a result ofgrowth in mortgage servicing balances and margins, home equity originations,insurance revenue and mortgage portfolio levels. Offsetting these positivefactors was the impact of rising interest rates that led to significant declinesin mortgage production volumes and secondary marketing sales and higher reportedexpenses as a result of a smaller percentage of costs allocated to the loanorigination process. Management anticipates a decline in origination volume in2000, when compared with 1999 levels, as a result of a rising interest rateenvironment. Mortgage originations (residential, home equity and manufacturedhousing) for the quarter were $15.8 billion and include originations primarilyfrom the retail, wholesale and correspondent (traditional and negotiated)channels. -22-  23DIVERSIFIED CONSUMER SERVICESRevenues from Diversified Consumer Services were $193 million in the firstquarter, down 24% from the same 1999 quarter, due mainly to a $100 milliondecrease in estimated auto lease residual value. This adjustment in estimatedauto residuals addressed exposure to potential losses on maturing leases as aresult of a decline in the market value of autos returned by lessees at leasetermination. Separately, revenue at Brown & Company, Chase's online tradingbusiness, was $60 million, a 67% increase from $36 million in the first quartera year ago. Brown & Company averaged more than 55,000 trades per day during thefirst quarter of 2000 versus 31,000 trades per day during the same period in1999. Revenues from the advice-based investment business rose to $62 million,a 17% increase when compared with $53 million in the same quarter last year.MIDDLE MARKETSMiddle Market revenues were $268 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 1999.Cash operating earnings increased 26% over the prior year quarter. The resultsreflect growth in financing and new business activity, along with disciplinedexpense management.GLOBAL SERVICESGlobal Services is a recognized leader in information and transaction processingservices, moving trillions of dollars daily in securities and cash for itswholesale customers. For a discussion of the profiles for each business withinGlobal Services, see page 34 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report. The discussion thatfollows focuses on the 2000 first quarter financial highlights.bp Denotes basis points; 100 bp equals 1%.================================================================================In the first quarter of 2000, Global Services' operating revenues were $851million, a 17% increase over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth inits securities processing businesses. Cash operating earnings for GlobalServices increased 39% from the first quarter of 1999 to $151 million.Shareholder value added was $62 million, an increase of 377% over the prior yearquarter.Global Investor Services, Chase's custody business, experienced a 28% rise inoperating revenues in the 2000 first quarter from the same period a year ago.During the 2000 first quarter, total assets under custody grew 17%, withcross-border assets under custody increasing 33%, in each case when comparedwith the 1999 first quarter. Operating revenues at Capital Markets FiduciaryServices, Chase's institutional trust business, increased 28% from the 1999first quarter, reflecting continued growth through expansion into new markets.Operating revenues at Chase Treasury Solutions in the first quarter remainedflat, when compared with the prior year period, reflecting the very maturenature of the industry.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATESupport Units include Chase.com, Chase Business Services and TechnologySolutions. For a further discussion of the business profile of these supportunits, see page 35 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.Corporate includes the effects remaining at the corporate level after theimplementation of management accounting policies. For the first quarter of 2000,Corporate and the other support units had cash operating earnings of $4 million,compared with a cash operating loss of $48 million in the first quarter of 1999.Chase utilizes an internal expense allocation process that aligns the cost ofeach of its operational and staff support services with the respectiverevenue-generating business. This allows Chase to evaluate the performance ofeach of its businesses on a fully allocated basis. -23-  24- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's credit risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1999 and should be read in conjunction withpages 37-44 and 62-64 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.The following table presents Chase's credit-related information for the datesindicated.(a) Represents the portion of Chase's credit card receivables that have been securitized.(b) Includes currently performing loans placed on a cash basis because of concerns as to collectibility.(c) Charge-offs for risk management instruments are included in trading revenue.NM Not meaningful.================================================================================ -24-  25Chase's managed credit-related assets of $226 billion at March 31, 2000 declined$1.5 billion or 1%, compared with year-end 1999, primarily reflecting a declinein levels of derivative and foreign exchange contracts. Consumer managedcredit-related assets declined $1 billion, largely in the managed credit cardportfolio, while commercial loans rose $1 billion, notably in the domesticcommercial loan portfolio. Chase's credit-related portfolio is balanced betweencommercial and consumer assets, with consumer assets comprising approximately46% of Chase's managed credit-related portfolio. The credit quality of Chase'scommercial credit-related assets, including derivative and foreign exchangeinstruments, has improved over the last several years. The portion of thecommercial portfolio considered investment grade was 54% at March 31, 2000.Net charge-offs in the managed portfolio were $596 million in the first quarterof 2000, down $53 million from the first quarter of 1999, reflecting decreasesin both the consumer and commercial portfolios. Management expects that creditcosts in 2000, on a managed basis, will remain relatively stable over theremainder of the year and will be of a similar magnitude to total credit costsincurred in 1999. For the consumer portfolio, management expects net charge-offrates in 2000 will be lower than in 1999; however, reported net charge-offs willvary depending on the level of credit card securitizations completed during theyear. The commercial charge-off rate varies more than the consumer charge-offrate, and over time Chase expects annual commercial net charge-offs to be in arange of 40-60 bp.CONSUMER LOANSChase's consumer portfolio is diversified by many different products, includingmortgages, credit cards and auto loans. This portfolio is primarily domestic andis geographically well-diversified. Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled$105 billion at March 31, 2000, a decrease of $1 billion since year-end.Consumer net charge-offs, on a managed basis, were $524 million, compared with$562 million in the first quarter of 1999, primarily reflecting a decline incredit card net charge-offs.RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS: Residential mortgage loans outstanding remainedstable at March 31, 2000 when compared with year-end balances, as did the levelof nonperforming residential mortgage loans. The loss rate of .08% for the 2000first quarter reflects the continued strong credit quality of this portfolio.CREDIT CARD LOANS: Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a "managedbasis," which includes credit card receivables on the balance sheet as well ascredit card receivables that have been securitized. The amounts discussed belowinclude domestic and international consumer and commercial credit card activity(for reporting purposes, commercial credit cards are reported within thecommercial loan category).Average managed credit card receivables of $33.3 billion increased 4% for thefirst quarter of 2000 when compared with the same period of 1999. During the2000 first quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average credit cardreceivables decreased to 5.41%, compared with 6.11% in the prior-year period.Loans over 90 days past due dropped to 1.76% of the portfolio at March 31, 2000,compared with 1.95% at March 31, 1999. Management anticipates that the managedcredit card net charge-off ratio for the full-year 2000 will be lower thanfull-year 1999.AUTO FINANCINGS: Auto financings outstanding remained stable at March 31, 2000when compared with year-end 1999. The charge-off rate of .45% for the 2000 firstquarter is indicative of this portfolio's selective approach to assetorigination.OTHER CONSUMER LOANS: The level of other domestic consumer loans, of $6.9billion at March 31, 2000, as well as the portfolio's credit quality, wasrelatively stable when compared with the 1999 year-end.COMMERCIAL LOANSLoan outstandings for Chase's commercial portfolio increased $1.2 billion or 1%since year-end. Commercial net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2000 were $72million, compared with $87 million in the first quarter of 1999.COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL: The domestic commercial and industrial portfolioincreased $0.9 billion from 1999 year-end, reflecting general business activity.Net charge-offs in the 2000 first quarter amounted to $36 million, or 30 bp onan annual basis. The foreign commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $25.3billion at March 31, 2000, an increase of 1% from the 1999 year-end levels.Nonperforming foreign commercial and industrial loans were unchanged at $642million from year-end 1999. Net charge-off levels for the first quarter of 2000decreased to $27 million or by 48% from the same period in 1999 as a result ofthe general stability of the markets.COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: Commercial real estate loans decreased $0.4 billion from1999 year-end levels principally as a result of securitizations, sales andrepayments. -25-  26FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: Loans to financial institutions increased $0.8 billionduring the 2000 first quarter when compared with year-end levels, primarily inthe domestic portion of the portfolio. Nonperforming financial institution loansdecreased 64% to $39 million primarily due to one counterparty in the foreignportfolio.FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS: Foreign government loans were $2.9 billion at March 31,2000, a $0.3 billion decrease from year-end levels. Nonperforming foreigngovernment loans decreased to $32 million or 22% from 1999 year-end levels.DERIVATIVE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTSFor a discussion of the derivative and foreign exchange contracts utilized inconnection with Chase's trading and A/L activities, see page 42 and Notes 1 and19 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report. The following table provides the remainingmaturities of derivative and foreign exchange contracts outstanding at March 31,2000 and December 31, 1999.CROSS-BORDER EXPOSUREThe following table presents Chase's exposure to emerging Latin America andAsia. Cross-border disclosure is based on the Federal Financial InstitutionsExamination Council ("FFIEC") guidelines governing the determination ofcross-border risk. For a further discussion of Chase's country exposure, seepage 43 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.(a) Cross-border disclosure is based on FFIEC guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. Under FFIEC guidelines, resale agreements are reported by the country of the issuer of the underlying security. Chase, however, does not consider the cross-border risk of resale agreements to depend upon the country of the issuer of the underlying security and, as a result, has presented these amounts separately in the above table.(b) Includes loans and accrued interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits with banks, acceptances, other monetary assets, issued letters of credit and undrawn commitments to extend credit.(c) Includes cross-border trading debt and equity instruments and the mark-to-market exposure of foreign exchange and derivative contracts. The amounts associated with foreign exchange and derivative contracts are presented after taking into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements.(d) Excludes Bermuda and Cayman Islands.(e) Excludes Japan, Australia and New Zealand.================================================================================ -26-  27ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSESLoans: Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probable creditlosses as of March 31, 2000 for which either the asset is not specificallyidentified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined. Within theallowance, there are both specific and expected loss components as well as aresidual component. For a further discussion of the specific, expected andresidual components of the allowance for loan losses, see page 44 of Chase's1999 Annual Report. The allowance for loan losses remained at $3,457 million atMarch 31, 2000, unchanged from year-end.Lending-Related Commitments: Chase also has an allowance for its lending-relatedcommitments, using a methodology similar to that for the loan portfolio.The following table represents Chase's allowance for credit losses at March 31,2000 and 1999.Chase deems its allowances to be adequate (i.e. sufficient to absorb losses thatmay currently exist but are not yet identifiable).- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's market risk management focuses primarily ondevelopments since December 31, 1999 and should be read in conjunction withpages 45-50 and Notes One and Nineteen of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.VAR AGGREGATE EXPOSUREValue-at-risk ("VAR") is a measure of the dollar amount of potential loss fromadverse market moves in an everyday market environment. The VAR looks forwardone trading day and is the loss expected to be exceeded with a 1 in 100 chance.The table that follows represents Chase's average and period-end VARs for itstrading and investment portfolios and A/L activities. During the twelve monthperiod ending March 31, 2000, no daily trading loss exceeded that day's tradingVAR. This compares with a statistically expected number of actual losses thatexceed the VAR of approximately 3 days.NM: Because the minimum and maximum VAR may occur on different days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a portfolio diversification effect. In addition, Chase's average and period-end VAR is less than the sum of the VARs of its market risk components due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification.================================================================================ -27-  28TRADING ACTIVITIESChase is exposed to interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity marketrisks in its trading portfolios. No single risk statistic can reflect allaspects of market risk; in addition, market exposures change continuouslythrough daily trading activities.Value at Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section on page 27 for Chase'saverage and period-end VARs for its total trading portfolio.Histogram: The following histogram illustrates Chase's daily market risk-relatedrevenue, which is defined as the daily change in value of the mark-to-markettrading portfolios plus any trading-related net interest income or otherrevenue. Based on actual trading results for the twelve months ended March 31,2000, Chase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 254 out of 262business trading days, with 82 business days exceeding positive $20 million.Chase incurred no daily trading losses in excess of negative $20 million overthe past twelve months. [Graphic of Daily Market Risk-Related Revenue - See Appendix I]Stress Testing: Whereas VAR captures Chase's exposure to unlikely events innormal markets, stress testing discloses the risk under plausible events inabnormal markets. Portfolio stress testing is integral to the market riskmanagement process and is co-equal with, and complementary to, VAR as a riskmeasurement and control tool. Giving equal weight to each produces a riskprofile that is diverse, disciplined and flexible enough to capture revenuegenerating opportunities during times of normal market moves but that also isprepared for periods of market turmoil.Corporate stress tests are performed approximately monthly on randomly selecteddates. As of March 31, 2000, Chase's corporate stress tests consisted of sixhistorical and four hypothetical scenarios. The historical scenarios includedthe 1994 bond market sell-off, the 1994 Mexican peso crisis and the 1998 Russiancrisis. The hypothetical scenarios included examinations of potential marketcrises originating in the United States, Japan and the Euro bloc.The following table represents the potential stress test loss (pre-tax) inChase's trading portfolio predicted by Chase's stress test scenarios. -28-  29INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ASSET/LIABILITY ACTIVITIESChase also has market risk exposure in its investment portfolios and A/Lactivities. Risk measurements for Chase's investment portfolio and A/Lactivities do not take into account all factors that have an effect on theseactivities, such as changes in credit quality.Net Interest Income Sensitivity: At March 31, 2000, Chase's NII sensitivity overthe next 12 months to an immediate 100 basis point shock in interest rates wasestimated to be approximately 3% of projected net income for full year 2000. AtMarch 31, 1999, Chase's exposure under the same scenario was approximately 3% ofprojected 1999 net income.Net Interest Income Stress Test: Chase's NII stress testing uses historical andhypothetical scenarios. The historical scenario is a replay of the rate andspread changes that occurred in 1994 (bond market sell-off), while the varioushypothetical scenarios examine the impact of alternative patterns in the U.S.dollar yield curve and in U.S. dollar spreads. At March 31, 2000, Chase'slargest potential NII stress test loss was estimated to be approximately 8.5% ofprojected net income for full year 2000. At year-end 1999, Chase's exposure wasestimated to be approximately 8% of projected net income for full year 2000.Value-at-Risk: See the VAR Aggregate Exposure section on page 27 for Chase'saverage and period-end VARs for its investment portfolio and marketrisk-related A/L activities.Nonstatistical Risk Measures: The table that follows shows that Chase had adirectional basis point value ("BPV") of ($3.1) million (pre-tax), indicatingthat the market value of Chase's A/L positions would have declined byapproximately $3.1 million for every one basis point increase in interest rates,along the interest rate yield curve. This compares with a directional BPV of($4.0) million at March 31, 1999. The following table also shows that theeconomic value of Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities would havedeclined by $8.7 million (pre-tax) for every one basis point widening ofinterest spreads. This compares with a BPV of ($11.8) million at March 31, 1999.Economic Value Stress Testing. Chase utilizes several historical andhypothetical scenarios when performing its economic value stress tests. As ofMarch 31, 2000, under the "flight-to-quality" scenario, the potential impact onthe economic value of Chase's investment portfolio and A/L activities would havebeen equivalent to less than 1% of Chase's market capitalization.IMPACT OF A/L DERIVATIVE ACTIVITYThe following table reflects the deferred gains/losses on closed derivativecontracts and unrecognized gains/losses on open derivative contracts utilized inChase's A/L activities at March 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999.(a) These net unrecognized losses do not include the net unfavorable/(favorable) impact from the assets/liabilities being hedged by these derivative contracts.================================================================================ -29-  30- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following capital and liquidity discussion should be read in conjunctionwith the Capital and Liquidity Risk Management section on pages 51-53 and Note18 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.CAPITALChase's capital levels at March 31, 2000 remained strong, with capital ratioswell in excess of regulatory guidelines. At March 31, 2000, the Tier 1 and TotalCapital ratios were 8.6% and 12.3%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverage ratiowas 6.6%. Management's long-term target range for Tier 1 Capital ratio is 8% to8.25%; however, this target may not always be maintained on a quarter-to-quarterbasis in light of changing economic conditions and business needs.The following table shows the sources and uses of Chase's free cash flow.During the first quarter of 2000, $1.1 billion of free cash flow was generated,which was primarily used for stock repurchases.In the first quarter of 2000, Chase raised the quarterly cash dividend on itscommon stock to $.48 per share from $.41 per share. Chase's dividend policy isto pay common stock dividends equal to approximately 25% to 35% of Chase'soperating earnings, less preferred stock dividends. Chase's future dividendpolicies will be determined by its Board of Directors after taking intoconsideration Chase's earnings and financial condition and applicable governmentregulations and policies.Under its equity repurchase program, which became effective January 19, 2000,Chase may repurchase up to $5 billion of its common stock in the open market orthrough negotiated transactions, in addition to any amounts that may need to bepurchased to provide for issuances under Chase's dividend reinvestment plan andits various stock-based employee benefit plans. As of March 31, 2000, Chaserepurchased approximately $675 million of stock, on a net basis. Chase hasannounced its intention to suspend stock repurchases under its current buybackprogram in order to accumulate capital to support Chase's proposed acquisitionof Flemings. Stock repurchases are planned to resume after the Flemingsacquisition is completed and Chase's Tier 1 Capital ratio returns tomanagement's target range of 8% to 8.25%, which is anticipated to occur byyear-end 2000.At March 31, 2000, the total capitalization of Chase (the sum of Tier 1 and Tier2 Capital) was $36.7 billion, an increase of $254 million from December 31,1999. This increase reflects retained earnings (net income less common andpreferred dividends) generated during the period, partially offset by commonstock repurchases.LIQUIDITYWhile capital is held to absorb losses over time, liquidity is managed to meetChase's known and unanticipated cash funding needs. Chase must maintainsufficient liquidity for operations, to meet payment demands on borrowings andto make new loans and investments as opportunities arise. During the firstquarter of 2000, Chase issued $3.9 billion of long-term debt, and $860 millionof long-term debt matured. -30-  31- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATING RISK MANAGEMENT- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion of Chase's operating risk management focuses primarilyon developments since December 31, 1999 and should be read in conjunction withthe Operating Risk Management section on page 54 of the 1999 Annual Report.Chase is exposed to many types of operating risk, including the risk of fraud byemployees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, and errorsrelating to computer and telecommunications systems. In early 2000, Chaseestablished two additional risk committees that report to Chase's ExecutiveCommittee. The Operating Risk Committee is authorized to review the design ofthe control function within Chase, and the Fiduciary Risk Committee isresponsible for approving Chase's policies for fiduciary risk.Chase maintains systems of controls that it believes are reasonably designed toprovide management and the Board of Directors with timely and accurateinformation about the operations of Chase. These systems have been designed tokeep operating risk at appropriate levels in view of Chase's financial strength,the characteristics of its businesses and the markets in which it operates, andthe competitive and regulatory environment to which it is subject. However,Chase has suffered losses from operating risk from time to time, and there canbe no assurance that Chase will not suffer such losses in the future.Chase continues its reconciliation project relating to the deficienciesidentified in the computerized recordkeeping systems of the bond paying agencyfunction within Chase's Capital Markets Fiduciary Services Group. In connectionwith this project, Chase incurred some immaterial costs during the first quarterof 2000. While management considers it likely that additional costs will beincurred during the remaining course of the project, it does not, based upon itsexperience to date, expect them to be material. The Securities and ExchangeCommission is investigating the question of whether, in connection with thismatter, there have been violations of its transfer agency recordkeeping orreporting regulations and whether Chase's disclosure regarding these issueshave been adequate and timely.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERVISION AND REGULATION- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1-4 of Chase's 1999 Annual Report.DIVIDENDSChase's bank subsidiaries could, without the approval of their relevant bankingregulators, pay dividends to their respective bank holding companies in amountsup to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatory restrictions. Thesedividend limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $2.8 billion atMarch 31, 2000.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------For a discussion of accounting developments related to derivatives and theallowance for loan losses, see the Accounting and Reporting Development sectionon page 55 of the 1999 Annual Report.- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHER EVENTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------On April 11, Chase announced that it had agreed to terms for an offer for RobertFleming Holdings Ltd. After the expected receipt of proceeds of $780 millionfrom the sale of Flemings' interest in its joint venture with T. Rowe PriceAssociates, Inc., Chase's cost for the Flemings acquisition will beapproximately $6.9 billion, of which approximately $3.6 billion will be in Chasecommon stock. Chase and Flemings also have agreed upon a retention arrangementfor key employees in an aggregate amount of approximately $240 million(after-tax), which will be expensed over the two years following the Flemingsacquisition. Flemings is a global asset management and investment banking firm,based in London, with approximately $100 billion in assets under management andinvestment banking activities in more than 40 countries. The transaction, whichis recommended by the Board of Flemings, is currently expected to be completedin the third quarter 2000 and will be accounted for under the purchase method.Following its acquisition, the company will be called Chase Flemings. -31-  32(a) Based on annualized amounts.(b) Excludes the impact of credit card securitizations, restructuring costs and special items.

In June 1999, Sumitomo Corporation filed a lawsuit against The Chase Manhattan Bank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that during the period from 1994 to 1996, the Bank assisted a Sumitomo employee in making copper trades by funding unauthorized loans to the Sumitomo employee. The complaint alleges that the Bank knew the employee did not have authority to enter into the transactions on behalf of Sumitomo. The complaint asserts claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Practices Act ("RICO") and New York common law and alleges damages of $532 million (subject to trebling under RICO), plus punitive damages. Chase Securities Inc. ("CSI") has been named as a defendant or third-party defendant in twelve actions that were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma beginning in October 1999 arising out of the failure of Commercial Financial Service, Inc. ("CFS"). Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchased over $1.6 billion in original face amount of asset-backed securities issued by CFS. The securities were backed by delinquent credit card receivables. In addition to CSI, the defendants in various of the actions are the founders and key executives of CFS, as well as its auditors, its outside counsel and the rating agencies that rated the securities. CSI is alleged to have been the investment banker to CFS and to have acted as an initial purchaser and as placement agent in connection with the issuance of certain of the securities. Plaintiffs allege that defendants either knew or were reckless in not knowing that the securities were sold to plaintiffs on the basis of misleading misrepresentations and omissions of material facts. The complaints against CSI assert claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Oklahoma Securities Act, and under common law theories of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. In the actions against CSI, damages in the amount of approximately $1 billion allegedly suffered as a result of defendants' misrepresentations and omissions, plus punitive damages, are being claimed. In addition to the matters described above, Chase and its subsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various legal actions and proceedings arising in connection with their respective businesses and have been involved from time to time in investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, Chase cannot state what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be. Chase is contesting the allegation made in each pending matter and believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Chase, but may be material to Chase's operating results for any particular period, depending on the level of Chase's income for such period.Item 2 Sales of Unregistered Common Stock During the first quarter of 2000, shares of common stock of Chase were issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 4(2) thereof. Shares of common stock were issued to retired executive officers who had deferred receipt of such common stock pursuant to the Corporate Performance Incentive Plan as follows: January 12, 2000 - 81,045 shares; January 27, 2000 - 14,535 shares; February 17, 2000 - 283 shares; February 18, 2000 - 659 shares; and March 21, 2000 - 6,145 shares. Shares of common stock were issued to retired directors who had deferred receipt of such common stock pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors as follows: January 3, 2000 - 1,176 shares. -36-
