Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEW&nbsp;Financial Highlights &#151; Reported Basis: Reported net income for J.P. MorganChase & Co. (&#147;JPMorgan Chase&#148; or the &#147;Firm&#148;) in the third quarter of 2003 was$1.6&nbsp;billion, or $0.78 per share, compared with net income of $40&nbsp;million, or$0.01 per share, in the third quarter of 2002, and net income of $1.8&nbsp;billion,or $0.89 per share, in the second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of2003, reported net income was $4.9&nbsp;billion, or $2.35 per share, compared with$2.1&nbsp;billion, or $1.00 per share, in the same period last year.Total revenues were $7.7&nbsp;billion, up 12% from the third quarter of 2002 anddown 14% from the second quarter of 2003. The year-over-year increase was ledby the Investment Bank (&#147;IB&#148;), which had higher fixed income revenues andinvestment banking fees. However, these revenues and fees were lower than inthe second quarter of 2003; the decline from that quarter was also attributableto lower home finance revenues at Chase Financial Services (&#147;CFS&#148;). For thefirst nine months of 2003, total revenue was $25.2&nbsp;billion, up 14% from thesame period last year, led by stronger performance in both IB and CFS.Total noninterest expense was $5.1&nbsp;billion, up 1% from the third quarter of2002 and down 13% from the second quarter of 2003. The increase over theyear-ago quarter was driven by Compensation expense, up 15%, due tohigher performance-related incentives as a result of the improvementin revenues. Thedecline from the second quarter of 2003 reflected lower incentivesexpense associated with the decline in revenues and a reduction inOccupancy expense, which included real estate charges for unoccupied spacein the second quarter. For the first nine months of 2003, total noninterest expense was $16.5billion, up 6% from the same period last year, primarily driven by higherperformance-related incentives expense and a higher level of chargesfor unoccupied excess real estate.The provision for credit losses for the 2003 third quarter of $223&nbsp;million wasdown 88% compared with the 2002 third quarter and down 49% compared with the2003 second quarter. The provision this quarter was lower than total netcharge-offs of $614&nbsp;million, reflecting continued improvement in the quality ofthe commercial loan portfolio. Commercial nonperforming assets and criticizedexposure levels declined 27% and 32%, respectively, from December&nbsp;31, 2002, asa result of restructurings, reduced exposures and charge-offs during 2003.Consumer credit quality remained stable.JPMorgan Chase's Tier 1 Capital ratio was 8.7% at September&nbsp;30, 2003. The Firmchanged its calculation for risk-weighted assets during the third quarter of2003; if the June&nbsp;30, 2003, Tier 1 capital ratio had been calculated on thesame basis as it was for September&nbsp;30, 2003, the Tier 1 ratio would have been8.4%, rather than the 8.7% previously reported. Tier 1 capital ratios forperiods prior to June&nbsp;30, 2003, have not been recalculated.Summary of SegmentResults: IB posted earnings of $922&nbsp;million and$3.0&nbsp;billion, and returns on allocated capital of 19% and 20%for the third quarter and nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, respectively, driven bystronger performance in investment banking and capital markets andlending; earnings declined from the second quarter of 2003 asunfavorable market conditions contributed to lower investment bankingand portfolio management results. CFS's 2003 third quarterearnings of $460&nbsp;million and return on allocated capital of 20%declined from the same period last year due to a volatile interestrate environment in the 2003 third quarter; year-to-date earnings of$2.0&nbsp;billion and a return on allocated capital of 31% reflectedhigh production volumes across all consumer credit businesses.Treasury & SecuritiesServices (&#147;T&SS&#148;) and Investment Management & PrivateBanking (&#147;IMPB&#148;) posted higher revenues, earnings andreturns on allocated capital, compared with the second quarter of 2003,and JPMorgan Partners (&#147;JPMP&#148;) had private equity gains of$120&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2003. For a discussion ofthe Firm's segment results, see pages&nbsp;30-44 of thisForm&nbsp;10-Q.24 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&nbsp;The following section provides a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's results ofoperations on a reported basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment banking feesFor a discussion of Investment banking fees, which are primarily recorded inIB, see IB segment results on pages 32-34 of this Form 10-Q.Trading revenueThe table below provides the components of Trading revenue:&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading revenue in the quarter of $829&nbsp;million improved significantly from lastyear's third quarter revenue of $26&nbsp;million and was down 46% from the secondquarter of 2003. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, Trading revenueof $3.7&nbsp;billion was up 76% from the same period last year. The growth from bothperiods last year reflected stronger client and portfolio management revenues,related to market-making and proprietary risk-taking activities. Tradingrevenue was down from the second quarter of 2003 due to lower portfoliomanagement results. Trading revenue, on a reported basis, excludes the impactof Net interest income (&#147;NII&#148;) related to IB's trading activities, which isreported in NII. However, the Firm includes NII in Trading revenue for segmentreporting purposes to better assess the profitability of IB's trading business.For additional information on Trading revenue, see IB segment discussion onpages 32-34 of this Form 10-Q.Fees and commissionsFees and commissions of $2.7&nbsp;billion for the quarter increased 3% and 7%compared with the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003,respectively. For the first nine months of 2003, Fees and commissions were flatversus the comparable period in 2002. The table below provides the significantcomponents of Fees and commissions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003,Investment management, custody and processing services fees increased 2% and6%, respectively, primarily due to the increasing equity valuations of assetsunder management and non-U.S. securities under custody. Credit card revenue was6% lower than in the third quarter of 2002 but 8% higher than in theimmediately preceding quarter. Brokerage and investment services fees increased7% from both the 2002 third quarter and the 2003 second25 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)quarter, stemming from a higher volume of brokerage transactions associatedwith more active global equities markets. The other factors contributing to theincreases were the impact of growth in business volume, new business and recentacquisitions, including JPMorgan Retirement Planning Services (&#147;RPS&#148;) in June2003.For the first nine months of 2003, Investment management, custody andprocessing services fees were 6% lower than in the same period last year,principally driven by the lower year-over-year values of assets undermanagement and institutional outflows. This decrease was offset by higherCredit card revenue of 4% and the impact of growth in business volume, newbusiness and recent acquisitions.For additional information on Fees and commissions, see the segment discussionsof T&SS for custody and securitiesprocessing fees, IMPB forinvestment management fees, and CFS for consumer-related fees on pages 34-35,36-37 and 39-44, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Private equity gains (losses)Private equity gains were $120&nbsp;million, compared with losses of $315&nbsp;million inthe third quarter of 2002 and $29&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003. Forthe first nine months of the year, Private equity losses were $130&nbsp;million,versus losses of $678&nbsp;million for the same period a year ago. For a discussionof Private equity gains (losses), which are primarily recorded in JPMP, see JPMP segment results on pages 37-39 of this Form 10-Q.Securities gainsSecurities gains of $164&nbsp;million declined 72% and 79% from the third quarter of2002 and the second quarter of 2003, respectively. On a year-to-date basis,Securities gains of $1.4&nbsp;billion were up 74% from the same period last year.The declines from the prior quarters were driven by lower gains realized fromsales of mortgage-backed securities in IB and Chase Home Finance (&#147;CHF&#148;), dueto the impact of higher interest rates. The increase from the first nine monthsof 2002 was attributable to the substantial gains realized in the first half of2003, when rates were at their lowest level in several years. IB usessecurities to manage, in part, asset/liability exposures of the Firm; CHF usesthese instruments to economically hedge the value of mortgage servicing rights(&#147;MSRs&#148;).Mortgage fees and related incomeMortgage fees and related income declined to negative $17&nbsp;million in the thirdquarter of 2003 from $512&nbsp;million in the same quarter of last year and $292million in the immediately preceding quarter. On a year-to-date basis, incomeof $692&nbsp;million declined 36% from the same period in 2002. For a furtherdisclosure of Mortgage fees and related income, see Note 3 on page 8 of thisForm 10-Q.Other revenueOther revenue of $213&nbsp;million rose by 7% from the 2002 third quarter and 233%from the 2003 second quarter. Revenue in the 2003 third quarter reflectedseveral gains, including $61&nbsp;million from loan restructurings; $51&nbsp;million fromsales of securities acquired in loan satisfactions; and $50&nbsp;million of gainsfrom a higher volume of commercial real estate loan securitizations. These werepartly offset by lower net results of corporate and bank-owned life insurancepolicies. The third quarter of 2002 included a $50&nbsp;million gain on the sale ofthe Firm's interest in a non-U.S. securities clearing firm, and $20&nbsp;millionrelated to the cancellation of the proposed purchase by New York City of 15Broad/23 Wall Street. In the first nine months of 2003, Other revenue wasslightly lower compared with the same period a year ago.Net interest incomeNII of $3.0&nbsp;billion was $312&nbsp;million higher than in the third quarter of 2002and relatively flat compared with the second quarter of 2003. The increase fromlast year was primarily driven by the declining interest rate environment,resulting in record originations in, and wider spreads on, mortgage loans.However, in the 2003 third quarter, deposit spreads declined. For the ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, NII of $9.3&nbsp;billion increased 9% compared withthe same period last year, due to lower overall funding costs and volume growthin mortgages and automobile loans. Trading-related net interest income of $449million was up $63&nbsp;million from the 2002 third quarter and down $30&nbsp;millionfrom the 2003 second quarter.On an aggregate basis, the Firm's total average interest-earning assets were$591&nbsp;billion, compared with $549&nbsp;billion in the third quarter of 2002 and $571billion in the second quarter of 2003. The net interest yield on these assets,on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was 2.05%, up six basis points from theprior-year quarter and down 11 basis points from the 2003 second quarter.26 Table of ContentsPart IItem 2 (continued)NONINTEREST EXPENSENoninterest expense of $5.1&nbsp;billion was relatively flat compared with the thirdquarter of 2002, but was down 13% from the second quarter of 2003. For the ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, Noninterest expense of $16.5&nbsp;billion was up 6%from the same period last year. The following table presents the components ofNoninterest expense:&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation expenseFor the third quarter and first nine months of 2003, Compensation expense rose15% over both comparable prior-year periods, to $2.7&nbsp;billion and $9.1&nbsp;billion, respectively. The increase was attributable tohigher performance-related incentive accruals and higher pension and otherpostretirement benefit costs, primarily due to changes in actuarialassumptions. The increase related to incentive accruals includes the impact ofadopting SFAS 123 effective January&nbsp;1, 2003, and the reversal in 2002 ofpreviously accrued expenses for certain forfeitable key employee stock awards.The increases were partially offset by reduced costs related to the vesting ofprior-year stock awards, forfeitures of stock awards, lower severance-relatedcosts, and the transfer beginning April&nbsp;1, 2003, of 2,800 employees to IBM inconnection with a technology infrastructure outsourcing agreement. The 16%decrease from the immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to lowerperformance-related cash incentive accruals of $570&nbsp;million.Occupancy expenseOccupancy expense of $391&nbsp;million decreased 18% from the third quarter of 2002and 28% from the second quarter of 2003 but, on a year-to-date basis, was 21%above the same period of 2002. The Firm recorded a $7&nbsp;million credit partly asa result of the sale of 15 Broad/23 Wall Street in the third quarter of 2003 and recorded charges forunoccupied excess real estate of $128&nbsp;million, $78&nbsp;million and $98&nbsp;million in the second and first quarters of this year andin the third quarter of 2002, respectively. The increase in Occupancy expensefor the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, was primarily the result ofadditional leased space in midtown Manhattan, higher real estate taxes in NewYork and the cost of enhanced safety measures. JPMorgan Chase continues toevaluate its current and projected space requirements. There is no assurancethat the Firm will be able to dispose of its excess premises, or that it willnot incur additional charges in connection with such dispositions.Technology and communications expenseIn the third quarter of 2003, Technology and communications expense was $719million, up 15% from the third quarter of 2002, but down slightly from thesecond quarter of 2003. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003,Technology and communications expense was $2.1&nbsp;billion, up 9% versus the sameperiod last year. These increases were primarily due to the shift in expensesfrom Compensation expense and Other expense into Technology and communicationsexpense as a result of the aforementioned IBM outsourcing agreement. The impacton total expenses as a result of this agreement is expected to be small in2003.Other expenseOther expense increased only slightly from both the third quarter of 2002 andthe second quarter of 2003 and was flat for the comparable year-to-date period.The following table presents the components of Other expense:&nbsp;&nbsp;27 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Professional services and Outside services increased from last year's quarterand year-to-date period to support the volume growth in the national consumercredit and securities processing businesses. These were partly offset byexpense management initiatives, including a shift in Professional servicesexpense to Technology and communications expense, the result of approximately1,000 system consultants moving to IBM in connection with the outsourcingagreement. The 4% increase in Other expense from the 2003 second quarterreflected higher credit card marketing expense and additional accruals relatedto pending legal matters unrelated to Enron.Surety settlement and litigation reserveThe second quarter of 2003 included a $100&nbsp;million addition to theEnron-related litigation reserve.Merger and restructuring costsAll costs related to business restructurings announced after January&nbsp;1, 2002,were recorded in their related expense categories. By contrast, merger andrestructuring costs of $333&nbsp;million in the 2002 third quarter and $817&nbsp;millionfor the 2002&nbsp;year-to-date period for programs announced prior to January&nbsp;1,2002, were viewed by management as nonoperating expenses or &#147;special items.&#148;Refer to Note 12 on pages 17-18 of this Form 10-Q for a summary of costsincurred in 2003 and 2002, and to page 21 and Note 6 on page 78 of JPMorganChase's 2002 Annual Report.Management currently anticipates that Noninterest expense for full-year 2003will be higher than for full-year 2002, excluding the impact of Enron-relatedlitigation and merger charges, driven primarily by increased incentives fromimproved business performance.Provision for credit lossesThe 2003 third quarter Provision for credit losses of $223&nbsp;million was $1.6billion lower than in the comparable 2002 quarter and $212&nbsp;million lower than in the 2003 second quarter. The provision for creditlosses of $1.4&nbsp;billion for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, was $2.0billion lower than for the same period last year. The declines from the priorperiods primarily reflected continued improvement in the quality of thecommercial loan portfolio. For a discussion of charge-offs associated with thecommercial and consumer loan portfolios and the Allowance for credit losses,see pages 47-58 and 57-58, respectively, of this Form 10-Q.Income tax expenseIncome tax expense was $802&nbsp;million, compared with $20&nbsp;million in the thirdquarter of 2002 and $940&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003. For the firstnine months of 2003, Income tax expense was $2.5&nbsp;billion, compared with $1.1billion for the first nine months of 2002. The effective tax rate was 33% inthe third quarter of 2003, compared with 34% for all other periods. The declinewas principally attributable to a change in the proportion of income subject tostate and local taxes.&nbsp;RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED RESULTS TO OPERATING BASIS&nbsp;The Firm prepares its Consolidated financial statements using U.S. GAAP. TheConsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP appearon pages 3-6 of this Form 10-Q. That presentation, which is referred to as&#147;reported basis,&#148; provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm'sresults that can be consistently tracked from year to year and enables acomparison of the Firm's performance with other companies' U.S. GAAP financialstatements.In addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, managementuses the non-GAAP financial measure &#147;operating basis&#148; to assess each of itslines of business and to measure overall Firm results against targeted goals.Operating basis starts with reported U.S. GAAP results and then excludes theimpact of credit card securitizations. JPMorgan Chase periodically securitizesa portion of its credit card portfolio by selling a pool of credit cardreceivables to a trust, which issues securities to investors. When credit cardreceivables are securitized, the Firm ceases to accrue the related interest andcredit costs; instead, the Firm receives fee revenue for continuing to servicethose receivables and additional revenue from any interest and fees on thereceivables in excess of the interest paid to investors, net of credit lossesand servicing fees. As a result, securitization does not change JPMorganChase's reported or operating net income; however, it does affect theclassification of items in the Consolidated statements of income.The Firm also reports credit costs on a &#147;managed&#148; or &#147;operating&#148; basis. Creditcosts on an operating basis are composed of the Provision for credit losses inthe Consolidated statements of income (which includes a provision for creditcard receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets) as well as credit costsassociated with securitized credit card loans. As a holder of residualinterests in securitization trusts, the Firm bears its share of the creditcosts for securitized loans. In the Firm's U.S. GAAP Consolidated financialstatements, credit costs associated with securitized credit card loans reducethe noninterest income remitted to the Firm from the trusts. This income isreported in credit card revenue in Fees and commissions over the life of thesecuritization.Prior to 2003, the Firm also excluded from its operating results the impact ofmerger and restructuring costs and special items, as these transactions wereviewed by management as not part of the Firm's normal daily business operationsor unusual in nature and, therefore, not indicative of trends. (To beconsidered a special item, the nonrecurring gain or loss had to be at least $75million or more during 2002.) Commencing in 2003, management has determinedthat many of the costs previously considered nonoperating will be deemedoperating costs; therefore, all such costs will be included in the Firm'sreported results. However, it is possible that in the future, management maydesignate certain material gains or losses incurred by the Firm to be &#147;specialitems.&#148;28 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The following summary tables provide a reconciliation between the Firm'sreported and operating results for the periods indicated:&nbsp;29 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used By the Firm in Evaluating Its Lines of BusinessThe Firm uses the shareholder value added (&#147;SVA&#148;) framework to measureperformance of its business segments. To derive SVA, a non-GAAP financialmeasure, the Firm applies a cost of capital to each business segment. Thecapital elements and resultant capital charges provide the businesses with thefinancial framework to evaluate the trade-off between the use of capital byeach business unit versus its return to shareholders. See segment results onpage 24-25 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report for a further discussion ofSVA. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Firm's SVA tooperating earnings on a consolidated basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table provides a reconciliation of the Firm's average assets toaverage managed assets, a non-GAAP financial measure:&nbsp;&nbsp;SEGMENT RESULTS&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's segment results reflect the manner in which financialinformation is currently evaluated by the Firm's management and is presented onan &#147;operating&#148; basis. Prior-period segment results have been adjusted toreflect alignment of management accounting policies or changes inorganizational structure among businesses. Line-of-business operating resultsreflect the revised internal management reporting policies previously disclosedin the Firm's Form 8-K dated July&nbsp;11, 2003. For a further discussion of thesemanagement accounting policies changes, see Note 22 on page 22 of this Form10-Q.Restatements of segment results may occur in the future as a result of thecontinued allocation of revenue and expense items from the Corporate segment tothe other business segments. See Support Units and Corporate on page 44 of thisForm 10-Q for a further discussion. For a discussion of the Firm'smethodologies of allocating capital to its business units, see CapitalManagement on pages 45-46 of this Form 10-Q, and Segment Results on pages 24-25of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.30 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The table below provides summary financial information on an operating basisfor the five major business segments and the Corporate segment. It alsoreconciles operating revenue to reported revenue and operating earnings to netincome.&nbsp;Summary of segment results&nbsp;&nbsp;31 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)INVESTMENT BANKFor a discussion of the business profile of the Investment Bank, see pages26-28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report. The following table sets forthselected IB financial data:&nbsp;&nbsp;32 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2&nbsp;(continued)IB reported operating earnings of $922&nbsp;million in the quarter, compared with anoperating loss of $255&nbsp;million in the third quarterof 2002 and operating earnings of $1.1&nbsp;billion in the second quarter of 2003.For the first nine months of 2003, operating earnings of $3.0&nbsp;billion were 188%higher than in the same period last year. For the third quarter of 2003, returnon allocated capital was 19%, compared with 22% in the previous quarter. Returnon allocated capital for the first nine months of 2003 was 20%, compared with7% in the first nine months of 2002. Operating revenue of $3.2&nbsp;billion in thethird quarter of 2003 was 29% higher than in the third quarter of 2002 and down25% from the second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of 2003,operating revenue of $11.5&nbsp;billion increased 24% over the same period lastyear.Investment banking fees of $636&nbsp;million increased 20% from the third quarter of2002 and were down 17% from the second quarter of 2003. Advisory revenues wereup 16% from the third quarter of 2002 and down 1% from the second quarter of2003, reflecting continued market weakness in merger and acquisition (&#147;M&A&#148;)activity. Equity underwriting fees were up 209% from the third quarter of 2002,reflecting increases in market share and equity volumes. Compared with thesecond quarter of 2003, equity underwriting fees were up 6%. Debt underwritingrevenue was down versus both periods; the decline from the second quarter of2003 reflected lower loan syndication fees, as demand for new corporate loansdecreased, and lower bond underwriting fees, as market volumes declined. Forthe nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, Investment banking fees decreased 1%compared with the prior-year period, driven by declines in M&A activity andoffset by growth in equity underwriting. For the first nine months of the year,the Firm improved its rankings in Global announced M&A to #3 and Global equity& equity related to #4, and it maintained its #1 ranking in Global syndicatedloans and its #2 ranking in U.S. investment-grade bonds.IB's capital markets and lending activities include Fixed income and Equitiesmarket-making and proprietary risk-taking; Global treasury, which manages theFirm's overall interest rate exposure and investment securities activities; andCredit portfolio, which includes corporate lending and credit risk managementactivities. Capital markets and lending operating revenue includes both clientrevenue and portfolio management revenue; the latter reflects net gains orlosses, exclusive of client revenue, generated from managing residual risks inthe portfolios. In addition, portfolio management revenue includes gains orlosses related to proprietary risk-taking activities to capture marketopportunities. IB evaluates its capital markets activities by considering allrevenue related to these activities, including Trading revenue, Fees andcommissions, Securities gains and related Net interest income and Otherrevenue. These activities are managed on a total-return revenue basis,including operating revenue plus the change in unrealized gains or losses oninvestment securities and hedges (included in comprehensive income) andinternally transfer-priced assets and liabilities.Capital markets and lending operating revenue for the quarter was $2.6&nbsp;billion,up 32% from the third quarter of 2002 and down 26% when compared with thesecond quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of 2003, Capital markets andlending operating revenue was $9.5&nbsp;billion, up 31% from last year.Capital markets and lending total-return revenue of $2.8&nbsp;billion was up 59%from the third quarter of 2002 on stronger client and portfolio managementrevenue, related to both market-making activities and proprietary risk-takingactivities. Compared with the second quarter of 2003, capital markets andlending total return revenue was down 15%, as lower portfolio managementresults more than offset increased client revenue. Capital markets clientrevenue was at the highest quarterly level since the merger. Fixed incomerevenue of $1.5&nbsp;billion increased 62% from the third quarter of 2002 anddecreased 28% from the second quarter of 2003. The decline from the secondquarter was primarily driven by lower portfolio management results in theglobal rates businesses, which were not positioned to take advantage of theincrease in interest rates in the middle of the quarter. Global treasury hadrevenue of $492&nbsp;million, up 36% from the third quarter of 2002 and up 13% fromthe second quarter of 2003. The increase was driven by gains from portfoliopositioning, as interest rates increased and mortgage-backed securities spreadstightened. Global treasury's activities complement, and offer a strategicbalance and diversification benefit to, the Firm's trading and fee-basedactivities. Credit portfolio revenue of $406&nbsp;million was down 8% from the thirdquarter of 2002, driven primarily by lower mark-to-market (&#147;MTM&#148;) revenuerelated to credit derivatives used to economically hedge IB's credit exposure.The decrease in MTM revenue was generally driven by overall widening of creditspreads in the third quarter of 2002 as compared with the overall globaltightening of credit spreads in the third quarter of 2003. Compared with thesecond quarter of 2003, Credit portfolio revenue was up 36% due to higher MTMrevenue, driven primarily by less severe credit spread tightening in the thirdquarter of 2003. For additional information, see the Credit Risk Managementdiscussion on credit derivatives on pages 53-55 of this Form 10-Q. Equitycapital markets revenue of $341&nbsp;million was up substantially compared withresults in the third quarter of 2002, which included weak portfolio managementresults in equity derivatives. Compared with the second quarter of 2003, equitycapital markets revenue declined 13%, as higher client revenue in the cashbusiness was more than offset by lower portfolio management results in equityderivatives.For the first nine months of 2003, Capital markets and lending total-returnrevenue was $9.3&nbsp;billion, up 32% from last year. Fixed income revenue was up39% due to higher portfolio management revenue in the first half of 2003,driven by favorable positioning in interest rate, credit and foreign exchangemarkets. Global treasury revenue was up 40% from last year due to riskpositioning to benefit from interest rate movements. Credit portfolio revenueof $1.1&nbsp;billion was down 8% from last year, due to lower MTM revenue resultingfrom credit spread tightening in the second quarter of 2003, as well as lowernet interest income, reflecting lower levels of commercial loan outstandings.Equities revenue of $1.2&nbsp;billion was up 44% due to higher client and portfoliomanagement results in derivatives and convertibles.33 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense of $1.8&nbsp;billionincreased 11% from the third quarter of 2002and decreased 26% from the second quarter of 2003. The increase from last yearwas driven by higher incentives resulting from improved financial performance,partially offset by lower noncompensation expenses and lower severance andrelated costs. Noncompensation expense decreased 3% from the third quarter of2002 and 10% from the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to lower litigationcosts. Severance and related costs decreased 67% from the third quarter of2002, primarily related to severance, and decreased 83% from the second quarterof 2003, primarily driven by lower real estate charges.For the first nine months of2003, operating expense was $6.5&nbsp;billion, up 14%compared with the same period last year, mainly due to higher incentives fromimproved financial performance. Noncompensation expense of $2.6&nbsp;billion wasflat compared with the first nine months of 2002. Severance and related costsof $280&nbsp;million were up 12% from the same period last year reflecting theimpact of losses on subletting unoccupied real estate, partiallyoffset by lower severance costs.Credit costs, reflectinga reduction in the allowance for credit losses, werenegative $181&nbsp;million for the quarter, compared with $1.3&nbsp;billionfor the third quarter of 2002 and negative $4&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2003. The lower provision resulted from the restructuring ofseveral nonperforming commercial loans and improvement in the overall creditquality of the portfolio. For the first nine months of 2003, credit costs were$60&nbsp;million, or 97% lower than in the same period last year. For additionalinformation, see Credit Risk Management on pages 47-59 of this Form 10-Q.The outlook for IB remains cautiously optimistic, based upon the gradualimprovement of the overall economic environment.

The following table sets forth selectedfinancial data of T&SS:34 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&SS reported operating earnings of $157&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2003,a decrease of 22% from the third quarter of 2002 and an increase of 25% fromthe second quarter of 2003. Return on allocated capital for the quarter was24%, compared with 31% for the third quarter of 2002 and 18% for the secondquarter of 2003. For the first nine months of 2003, operating earnings of $414million were 18% lower compared with the same period last year. Return onallocated capital for the first nine months of 2003 was 20%, compared with 25%for the same period last year.Operating revenue was $1.0&nbsp;billion, a decrease of 2% from the third quarter of2002 and an increase of 3% from the second quarter of 2003. T&SS results forthe third quarter of 2002 included a pre-tax gain of $50&nbsp;million on the sale ofthe Firm's interest in Centrale de Livraison de Valeurs Mobilieres (&#147;CEDEL&#148;), anon-U.S. securities clearing firm. Adjusting for this gain, revenue would haverisen 3% versus the previous year. Treasury Services revenue increased by 7%from the third quarter of 2002 andby 6% from the second quarter of 2003, due to higher trade and commercial cardrevenue, and increased balance-related earnings, including higher balance deficiency fees resulting from the lowerinterest rate environment. Investor Services revenue decreased 3% from thethird quarter of 2002, the result of lower NII, due to the lower interest rateenvironment, partially offset by higher demand deposit accounts and othernoninterest-bearing deposits. The decrease was also the result of lower foreignexchange revenue resulting from a higher volume of lower-margin transactions.Revenue increased 3% from the second quarter of 2003 due to higher custodyfees, driven by market appreciation of customers' securities and new business.Institutional Trust Services revenue was up 8% from the third quarter of 2002due to growth in certain debt product lines, increased volume in the assetservicing business and the impact of acquisitions; revenue declined a modest 1%from the second quarter of 2003.Total T&SS revenue for the first nine months of $2.9&nbsp;billion was 1% lowercompared with the same period last year. Investor Services revenue of $1.1billion decreased by 9%, reflecting continued weakness in global equitymarkets, which were substantially offset by a 7% increase in revenue atTreasury Services and a 6% increase at Institutional Trust Services. Theincrease of Treasury Services revenue to $1.5&nbsp;billion was fueled by higherbalance-related earnings. Institutional Trust Services revenue was up due togrowth in certain debt product lines, increased volume in the asset servicingbusiness and the impact of acquisitions. The decrease in the Other businessline for the quarter and nine-month period is primarily attributable to the $50million pre-tax gain in the third quarter of 2002 upon the sale of CEDEL.Operating expense increased 5% from the third quarter of 2002, attributable tohigher expenses at Treasury Services and Institutional Trust Services insupport of increased revenues, as well as higher severance, the impact ofacquisitions, the cost associated with expensing of options and increasedpension costs. Operating expense decreased 3% from the second quarter of 2003,which included charges to provide for losses on sublettingunoccupied excess real estate. The overhead ratio of 77% for the third quarterof 2003 increased from 72% in the third quarter of 2002 and decreased from 81%in the second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of 2003, operatingexpense was $2.3&nbsp;billion, up 4% from the same period last year. The overheadratio for the nine months was 79%, compared with 76% for the same period lastyear.

The following table reflects selected financialdata of IMPB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPB reported operating earnings of $85&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2003,an increase of 25% from the third quarter of 2002 and 27% from the secondquarter of 2003. Pre-tax margin was 18%, compared with 15% in both the thirdquarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of2003, operating earnings of $187&nbsp;million were 25% lower compared with the sameperiod last year. Return on allocated capital for the third quarter of 2003 was6%, compared with 5% in both the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarterof 2003. Return on tangible allocated capital was 25%, compared with 19% in thethird quarter of 2002 and 20% in the second quarter of 2003.Operating revenue was $737&nbsp;million, 6% higher than in the third quarter of 2002and 9% higher than in the second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of2003, revenue of $2.1&nbsp;billion was 6% lower compared with the same period lastyear. The increase from the prior-year quarter primarily reflected increasingglobal equity valuations, the acquisition of RPS and stronger brokerage activity. The RPS acquisition andincreased equity valuations also contributed to the growth in revenue versusthe second quarter of 2003, as did net inflows of assets under supervision andstronger brokerage activity. Net outflows of assets under supervision, loweraverage equity valuations and lower brokerage activity, partially offset by theacquisition of RPS, accounted for the year-to-date operating revenue decrease.Operating expense of $613&nbsp;million was 9% higher compared with the third quarterof 2002 and 6% higher than in the second quarter of 2003. For the first ninemonths of 2003, operating expense of $1.8&nbsp;billion was 2% higher compared withthe same period last year. The increases from both periods in 2002 reflectedhigher compensation expense and additional expenses arising from theacquisition of RPS, partially offset by the impact of merger and other expensesavings initiatives implemented during 2002 and 2003. The increase from thesecond quarter of 2003 was driven by the acquisition of RPS. Credit costs werenegative $7&nbsp;million for the third quarter of 2003, down from $26&nbsp;million in thethird quarter of 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, credit costs werenegative $1&nbsp;million, down from $71&nbsp;million for the same period last year. Thedecline in credit costs reflects recoveries and improvements in the quality ofthe credit portfolio.36 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The table below reflects the assets under supervision in IMPB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total assets under supervision (&#147;AUS&#148;) at September&nbsp;30, 2003, of $720&nbsp;billionwere 14% higher than at September&nbsp;30, 2002, and 4% higher than at June&nbsp;30,2003. Equity market appreciation and the acquisition of RPS, which added $41billion in administration assets, drove the year-over-year increase.

The following table sets forth selected financialdata of JPMP:&nbsp;JPMP had net operating earnings of $10&nbsp;million for the 2003 third quarter,compared with a net operating loss of $278&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2002and a net operating loss of $91&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003. For thefirst nine months of 2003, JPMP had operating losses of $298&nbsp;million, comparedwith operating losses of $692&nbsp;million for the same period last year.Total net private equity gains were $120&nbsp;million, compared with net losses of$299&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2002 and net losses of $22&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2003. In the current quarter, JPMP's direct private equityinvestments recorded net37 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)gains of $161&nbsp;million, compared with net losses of $239&nbsp;million in the thirdquarter of 2002 and net gains of $123&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2003.JPMP's direct private equity results in the current quarter included $134million in net realized cash gains, $26&nbsp;million in MTM gains on publicsecurities, and $1&nbsp;million in positive net valuation changes on privateinvestments. The net valuation changes reflected write-downs of $65&nbsp;million,which were entirely offset by $66&nbsp;million of write-ups. In private third-partyfunds, JPMP recorded a $41&nbsp;million net loss on its limited partner interests,compared with net losses of $60&nbsp;million and $145&nbsp;million in the third quarterof 2002 and the second quarter of 2003, respectively. The third quarter 2003results included losses on the disposition of funded interests in privatethird-party funds under contract to be sold in the fourth quarter.Although the current quarter's operating results reflect improvement over the2002 third quarter and 2003 second quarter, JPMP will not realize consistentlypositive results until market conditions improve and exit opportunitiesincrease.&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Partners Investment PortfolioThe following table presents the carrying value and cost of the JPMP investmentportfolio for the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying value of the JPMP private equity portfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2003,was $7.8&nbsp;billion, a 3% reduction from the September&nbsp;30, 2002, carrying value of$8.0&nbsp;billion. The reduction was primarily the result of a $400&nbsp;million decreasein the carrying value of private third-party fund investments, driven by salesand write-downs as JPMP looks to dispose opportunistically of noncore assets.The carrying value of industrial investments increased to 28% of the totalportfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with 25% at September&nbsp;30, 2002,reflecting JPMP's increased investment in industrial buyout activity during theperiod. JPMP made direct investments of $137&nbsp;million for the Firm's accountduring the third quarter of 2003, primarily in the Consumer and LifeSciences/Healthcare Infrastructure sectors.38 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)The industry group percentages in the accompanying table are based on thecarrying values of JPMP's private equity portfolio as of September&nbsp;30, 2003,December&nbsp;31, 2002, and September&nbsp;30, 2002. In terms of dollar amounts, someindustry sectors have the same, or lower, carrying values at September&nbsp;30,2003, as compared with December&nbsp;31, 2002, and September&nbsp;30, 2002, but thesesectors may comprise the same or a higher percentage of the total carryingvalue of the September&nbsp;30, 2003, portfolio than they did at December&nbsp;31, 2002,and September&nbsp;30, 2002.

The following tablereflects selected financial data of CFS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2(continued)CFS reported operating earnings of $460&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2003, adecrease of 40% from the third quarter of 2002 and 48% from the second quarterof 2003. For the first nine months of 2003, operating earnings of $2.0&nbsp;billionwere 6% higher compared with the same period last year. Return on allocatedcapital was 20%, compared with 35% for the third quarter of 2002 and 41% forthe previous quarter. For the first nine months of 2003, return on allocatedcapital was 31%, compared with 29% for the same period last year.Operating revenue was $3.4&nbsp;billion, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter of2002 and 16% from the second quarter of 2003. For the nine months endedSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, operating revenue was $11.0&nbsp;billion, or 9% higher than inthe same period last year. The decrease in revenue from the third quarter of2002 and the second quarter of 2003 primarily reflected a volatile interestrate environment, which negatively impacted Chase Home Finance's operating(excluding MSR hedging revenue) and MSR hedging revenue. On a year-to-datebasis, the increased revenue was driven by high production volumes across allconsumer credit businesses, partially offset by the negative impact of lowinterest rates on deposits. The national consumer credit businesses (Chase HomeFinance, Chase Cardmember Services and Chase Auto Finance) contributed 73% ofCFS's third quarter 2003 operating revenue.Operating expense of $1.7&nbsp;billion for the quarter was 5% higher compared withthe third quarter of 2002 and 1% lower than in the second quarter of 2003. Forthe first nine months of 2003, operating expense was up 9% compared with thesame period last year. The increases, compared with last year's three monthsand nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, reflected higher business volumes,salaries and benefits and, for the nine-month period, higherperformance-related incentive accruals, including an accrual for optionexpense. CFS's overhead ratio was 52%, compared with 45% for the third quarterof 2002 and 44% for the second quarter of 2003. The higher overhead ratioreflects the decline in revenue. For the first nine months of 2003, theoverhead ratio remained flat at 48%. Savings generated by Six Sigma and otherproductivity programs continued to partially offset the growth in expenses.Credit costs on a managed basis (including securitized credit cards) of $883million increased 7% compared with the third quarter of 2002, reflecting a 24%increase in average managed loans outstanding and 6% higher charge-offs,primarily due to higher bankruptcies. Credit costs increased 8% compared withthe second quarter of 2003, primarily as a result of a 5% increase in averagemanaged loans outstanding. Charge-offs were flat compared with the previousquarter. The increases in average managed loans compared with the third quarterof 2002 and second quarter of 2003 were primarily due to higher levels ofmortgage and auto originations. Credit costs for the first nine months of 2003increased 13% to $2.6&nbsp;billion, primarily due to a higher level of charge-offsin 2002 in excess of the provision for credit losses; also contributing to thecost increase was a 20% rise in average managed loans, reflecting highermortgage and auto originations and higher credit card outstandings fromincreased customer purchase volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth certain key financial performance measures ofthe businesses within CFS.&nbsp;40 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Chase Home FinanceIn the third quarter of 2003, CHF reported operating earnings of $124&nbsp;million,a decrease of 68% compared with the third quarter of 2002 and 78% compared withthe second quarter of 2003. CHF's third quarter 2003 total operating revenue of$662&nbsp;million, comprised of operating revenue (which excludes MSR hedgingrevenue) and MSR hedging revenue, decreased 32% and 50% from the third quarterof 2002 and the second quarter of 2003, respectively. While markets wereextremely volatile during the third quarter of 2003, the hedging of MSRsgenerated a small net loss of $6&nbsp;million, compared with hedging gains of $263million in the third quarter of 2002 and $233&nbsp;million last quarter. Operatingrevenue (which excludes MSR hedging revenue) of $668&nbsp;million declined $40million and $418&nbsp;million compared with the third quarter of 2002 and secondquarter of 2003. The principal reasons for the declines were losses from thehedging of pipeline and warehouse loans, as compared with gains inthe third quarter of 2002 and second quarter of 2003, and lower revenue resulting from customer rate-lock extensions toaccommodate record volumes.For the first nine months of 2003, CHF had record earnings of $1.1&nbsp;billion, 45%higher than in the same period last year, due to the strong refinancing marketand higher revenue from hedging MSRs. Total operating revenue for the firstnine months of 2003 was $3.1&nbsp;billion, 37% higher than in the same period lastyear. The strong results for the first nine months of 2003 were due to CHF'srecord level of residential first-mortgage loan originations and continuedexpansion into strategic business sectors, such as home equity, whereorigination volumes increased 74% compared with the same period last year.Total origination volume in the 2003 third quarter was at an all-time high of$93&nbsp;billion, an increase of 158% and 19% from the third quarter of 2002 and thesecond quarter of 2003, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;CHF uses a combination of derivatives and AFS securities to hedge the value ofits MSRs. As disclosed below, during the third quarter of 2003, positivevaluation adjustments of $258&nbsp;million were offset by $264&nbsp;million of aggregatederivative losses, realized losses on sales of AFS securities, and net interestearned on AFS securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;41 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating expense of $416&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2003 was up 34% and10% compared with the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003,respectively. For the first nine months of 2003, operating expense of $1.2billion was 26% higher compared with the same period last year. The increase inoperating expense was a result of growth in origination volume and in the homeequity business, as well as a higher level of mortgage servicing activity.Credit costs of $61&nbsp;million for the third quarter of 2003 declined from $62million in the third quarter of 2002 and increased from $58&nbsp;million in thesecond quarter of 2003. The net charge-off rate for the third quarter of 2003was 0.15%, down from 0.21% in the third quarter of 2002 and 0.18% in the secondquarter of 2003, primarily the result of a higher proportion of loans that wereoriginated for sale. The 30&#043; delinquency rate on loans held for investment was2.1% for the third quarter of 2003, down from 2.8% and 2.2% from the thirdquarter of 2002 and second quarter of 2003, respectively. For the first ninemonths of 2003, credit costs were $227&nbsp;million, up 47% from the same periodlast year. The increase was due to a higher provision for credit losses,primarily the result of higher loan balances. The net charge-off rate for thenine-month period was 0.18%, down from 0.24% for the same period a year ago.Chase Cardmember ServicesOperating earnings at Chase Cardmember Services (&#147;CCS&#148;) were $206&nbsp;million, adecrease of 11% from the third quarter of 2002 and an increase of 19% from thesecond quarter of 2003. The decrease in earnings from the same period last yearreflects an increase in credit costs due primarily to a relatively high levelof bankruptcies; credit costs were $705&nbsp;million, compared with$648&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2002. The earnings decrease was alsoattributable to higher payment rates and a slowdown in the rate of receivablegrowth, reflective of industry trends. The increase in earnings from the secondquarter of 2003 reflected higher net interest and fee-related revenue. Duringthe first nine months of 2003, operating earnings decreased 1% compared withthe same period last year, due to higher expenses related to increasednew-product and customer-acquisition marketing, as well as higher rebate costsassociated with the marketing of rewards-based products. Higher credit costsreflecting an increase in average loans outstanding also contributed to thedecline in earnings.Operating revenue increased 1% from the third quarter of 2002 and 4% from thesecond quarter of 2003. The increase in operating revenue from the thirdquarter of 2002 reflected higher fee-related revenue and lower funding costs.The increase from the previous quarter reflected balance growth inhigher-yielding segments and growth in fee-related revenue. Total volume(purchases, balance transfers and cash advances) was essentially unchanged fromthe third quarter of 2002, as higher purchase volume was offset by lower cashadvances and balance transfers. Total volume increased 3% from the secondquarter of 2003, driven by higher purchase volume that partly reflected themovement towards rewards-based products. Average managed loans were $50.9billion at the end of the third quarter of 2003, up 1% from the third quarterof 2002 and essentially unchanged from the second quarter of 2003. For thefirst nine months of 2003, operating revenue increased 4% compared with thesame period last year, reflecting higher average loans outstanding, lowerfunding costs and an increase in fee-related revenue. For the nine-monthperiod, total volume increased 5% compared with the same period last year.Total operating expense increased 1% from the third quarter of 2002 and 2% fromthe second quarter of 2003. The increase from the second quarter of 2003 wasdue primarily to greater marketing investment to stimulate existing accountusage and acquire new customers. In the third quarter, CCS added more than onemillion new accounts and launched a new co-branded reward card with MarathonAshland Petroleum LLC. For the first nine months of 2003, operating expense wasup 5% compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher marketing andvolume-related expenses, partly offset by productivity initiatives. Theseinitiatives have enabled CCS to fund the marketing of new and existingvalue-added rewards-based products to capture wallet share and more effectivelyposition CCS for the future.The managed net charge-off rate for the third quarter was 5.83%, up 29 basispoints from the third quarter of 2002 and down 19 basis points from the secondquarter of 2003. The increase from the third quarter of 2002 was primarilyattributable to higher bankruptcies, partly offset by higher recoveries. Thedecline in the net charge-off rate from the second quarter of 2003 reflectsongoing improvement efforts related to risk management and collectionpractices. The managed net charge-off rate for the nine-month period was 5.93%,compared with 5.95% for the same period of 2002. The 30&#043; delinquency rate was4.62% in the third quarter of 2003, up 15 basis points from the third quarterof 2002 and 22 basis points from the second quarter of 2003. The increase inthe delinquency rate from the year-ago quarter primarily reflected slowerreceivable growth. The increase in the delinquency rate from the secondquarter of this year primarily reflects seasonality.Chase Auto FinanceResults at Chase Auto Finance (&#147;CAF&#148;) consist of the Auto Finance and EducationFinance businesses. CAF's operating earnings of $50&nbsp;million increased 108% fromthe third quarter of 2002 and decreased 26% from the second quarter of 2003.The increase in earnings from the third quarter of last year was driven bycontinued revenue growth, improved operating efficiency and lower credit costs.The decrease from the second quarter of 2003 was driven primarily by highercredit costs, reflecting continued portfolio growth and an increase in expectedlease charge-off rates, partially offset by an improvement in expected loancharge-off rates. For the first nine months of 2003, operating earnings were$157&nbsp;million, 17% higher compared with the same period last year. The increasewas driven by an increase in average loans outstanding, partly offset by highervolume-related operating expenses and higher credit costs.42 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)CAF reported revenue of $218&nbsp;million for the third quarter of 2003, up 32% fromthe third quarter of 2002 and down 2% from the second quarter of 2003. Theincrease in revenue from last year was driven by strong operating performance,due to higher average loans outstanding, reflecting continued strongorigination volume and lower funding costs. The decrease in revenue from thesecond quarter of 2003 was driven by lower origination volumes and lowerspreads. CAF had loan and lease origination volume of $7.0&nbsp;billion in the third quarter of 2003, an 8% and 11% decrease from thethird quarter of 2002 and second quarter of 2003, respectively. For the firstnine months of 2003, operating revenue of $639&nbsp;million was up 28% compared withthe same period last year, and origination volume of $22.3&nbsp;billion was at arecord level, up 21% from the prior period.Operating expense of $72&nbsp;million was up 18% from the third quarter of 2002 andflat compared with the second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of2003, operating expense of $211&nbsp;million was 15% higher compared with the sameperiod last year. The increase in expenses from the prior-year quarter wasdriven by higher average loans outstanding and, for the nine-month period,higher origination volumes and higher average loans outstanding.Credit costs of $61&nbsp;million decreased 24% compared with the third quarter of2002 due to slightly lower charge-offs and a reduction in required reserveadditions. Compared with the second quarter of 2003, credit costs increased72%, due to slightly higher charge-offs and charge-offs in excess of theprovision last quarter. Credit costs increased 48% during the first nine monthsof 2003 compared with the same period last year, due to higher volumes of loansoutstanding and charge-offs in excess of the provision for credit losses lastyear. Credit quality continues to be strong relative to last year. The netcharge-off rate decreased to 0.41% in the third quarter of 2003, from 0.59% inthe third quarter of 2002, and the 30&#043; delinquency rate decreased to 1.16% inthe third quarter of 2003, from 1.43% in the third quarter of 2002. Thecharge-off rate increased from 0.37% in the second quarter of 2003, and the 30&#043;delinquency rate increased slightly from 1.14% in the second quarter of 2003.These increases were primarily due to seasonality.Chase Regional BankingOperating earnings at Chase Regional Banking (&#147;CRB&#148;) of $18&nbsp;million decreased76% compared with the third quarter of 2002 and 57% compared with the secondquarter of 2003. The decrease from the third quarter of 2002 primarily resultedfrom declining spreads on deposits, partially offset by growth in averagedeposits. The decrease from the second quarter of 2003 was primarily due to therecognition in the second quarter of a further gain on the sale of CRB'sEastern Caribbean operations and an increase in credit costs. For the firstnine months of 2003, operating earnings of $95&nbsp;million declined 66% comparedwith the same period last year, driven by lower deposit spreads and increasedcredit costs.Operating revenue of $637&nbsp;million decreased 9% from the third quarter of 2002and 3% from the second quarter of 2003. The decline in revenue from the thirdquarter of 2002 was predominantly attributable to the lower interest rateenvironment, which resulted in lower net interest earned on deposit balances.Growth in average deposits of 8% from the third quarter of 2002 partiallyoffset the decline in net interest. The decline in revenue from the secondquarter of 2003 was due to the above-mentioned gain, partly offset by a 2%increase in average deposits. For the first nine months of 2003, operatingrevenue declined 10% compared with the same period last year, due to the lowerinterest rate environment.Operating expense was up 3% from the comparable 2002 period and down 1% fromthe second quarter of 2003. For the first nine months of 2003, operatingexpense of $1.7&nbsp;billion was 3% higher compared with the same period last year.The increases were due primarily to higher compensation expenses related toincreased staff levels.Credit costs of $36&nbsp;million were up $18&nbsp;million from the third quarter of 2002and $22&nbsp;million from the second quarter of 2003. The increase was the result ofa $17&nbsp;million rise in the allowance for credit losses and the impact ofincreased loan volume. For the first nine months of 2003, credit costs were $58million, compared with negative $5&nbsp;million for the same period last year. Theincrease is related to the aforementioned items as well charge-offs in excessof the provision for credit losses that occurred in 2002.As of September&nbsp;30, 2003, CRB's deposit mix was 18% demand, 14% interestchecking, 47% savings, 10% money market and 11% time (CDs). At September&nbsp;30,2002, the deposit mix was 18% demand, 13% interest checking, 46% savings, 8%money market and 15% time (CDs). As of September&nbsp;30, 2003, core deposits (totaldeposits less time deposits) grew 11% from December&nbsp;31, 2002, and 13% fromSeptember&nbsp;30, 2002.Chase Middle MarketChase Middle Market (&#147;CMM&#148;) operating earnings of $70&nbsp;million were down 26%from the third quarter of 2002 and down 15% from the second quarter of 2003.For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, operating earnings of $243million declined 9% compared with the same period a year ago. The decreasesfrom the third quarter of 2002 and from the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,2002, were primarily attributable to lower deposit spreads, as a result of thelower interest rate environment, and higher severance expenses. The declinefrom the second quarter of 2003 was due to higher severance in the thirdquarter.43 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Operating revenue of $367&nbsp;million in the third quarter of 2003 decreased 2%from the third quarter of 2002 and increased 3% from the second quarter of2003. The decrease from the same quarter last year was the result of the lowerinterest rate environment, partially offset by higher deposit levels andcapital markets fees. The increase from the second quarter of this year was dueto higher deposit service fees. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003,revenue of $1.1&nbsp;billion was down 2% from the same period last year. Depositswere up 19% and loans increased 5% when compared with the first nine months of2002; however, net interest income was down 4% due to the lower-rateenvironment. The revenue decline from the third quarter and first nine monthsof 2002 was partly offset by higher deposit service fees, as the lower interestrate environment resulted in reduced values of customers' compensatingbalances; consequently, customers paid incremental fees for deposit services.Operating expense was $225&nbsp;million, an increase of 13% compared with the thirdquarter of 2002 and 3% compared with the second quarter of 2003. For the firstnine months of 2003, operating expense of $655&nbsp;million was 6% higher than inthe same period last year. The increase in expenses from all comparativeperiods was primarily due to higher severance costs and higherperformance-based incentives. Credit costs of $21&nbsp;million were up $7&nbsp;millioncompared with the third quarter of 2002, and up from negative $3&nbsp;millionin the second quarter of 2003 due to higher charge-offs andcharge-offs in excess of the provision for last quarter. Credit costs for thefirst nine months of 2003 were $16&nbsp;million, down 53% from the same period lastyear due to lower required reserves.SUPPORT UNITS AND CORPORATEJPMorgan Chase's Support Units and Corporate segment includes Corporatetechnology, legal, audit, corporate finance, human resources, risk managementand corporate marketing. For a further discussion of the business profiles ofthese Support Units as well as a description of Corporate, see page 39 ofJPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Corporate reflects the residual accounting effect after the application ofmanagement accounting policies, which include allocating technology,operational and staff support costs to the respective revenue-generatingbusinesses. This allows management to evaluate business performance on anallocated basis.The Corporate segment historically reports a net loss, primarily driven bynegative revenue. This occurs from overallocating revenues as a result of fundstransfer-pricing and other management accounting policies. Expense items in theCorporate segment result from timing differences in allocations to businesssegments, residuals from interoffice allocations among the business segmentsand other items considered appropriate to retain in this segment. Although theCorporate segment generally has no credit exposures, it maintains the residualcomponent of the Allowance for credit losses, which is not allocated to anybusiness segment. For the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, credit costsincreased by $12&nbsp;million. For a further discussion of the residual component,see pages 57&#150;58 of this Form 10-Q.The decline in the net loss from the second quarter of 2003 is attributable tothe Firm not requiring a provision for the residual component of the Allowancefor credit losses in the third quarter of 2003. Also contributing to thedecline were timing differences related to the allocation from the Corporatesector of technology and other corporate expenses to the various businesses.The year-to-date increase in expense was due to higher incentives, includingthe impact in 2002 of reversing previously accrued expenses related toforfeitable stock awards, and higher technology-related costs.44 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase is in the business of managing risk to create shareholder value.The major risks to which the Firm is exposed are credit, market, operational,business, liquidity and private equity risk. For a discussion of these risksand definitions of terms associated with managing these risks, see pages 40&#150;65and the Glossary of Terms in JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT&nbsp;CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&nbsp;Economic capitalJPMorgan Chase assesses capital adequacy utilizing internal risk assessmentmethodologies. The Firm assigns economic risk capital based primarily on fiverisk factors: credit risk, market risk, operational risk and business risk foreach business and private equity risk (principally for JPMP). The methodologiesquantify these risks and assign capital accordingly. Additionally, the Firmassesses capital against certain nonrisk factors.A review of the Firm's risk and capital measurement methodologies was completedin the second quarter of 2003, resulting in the reallocation of capital amongthe risk categories and certain business segments. New capital measurementmethodologies were implemented but did not result in a significant change inthe total capital allocated to the business segments as a whole. Prior periodswere restated to reflect the revised capital measurement methodologies. For afurther discussion of these new methodologies, see Capital Allocation forCredit Risk, Operational and Business Risk Management and Private Equity RiskManagement on pages 59, 61 and 62, respectively, of this Form 10-Q. Also seeJPMorgan Chase's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, and Form 8-Kdated July&nbsp;11, 2003, for more details. Internal capital allocationmethodologies may change in the future to reflect refinements of economiccapital methodologies.The Firm's capital in excess of internally required capital at September&nbsp;30,2003, increased by $1.8&nbsp;billion over September&nbsp;30, 2002, primarily due to anincrease in average common stockholders' equity of $0.9&nbsp;billion and a reductionin average capital allocated to business activities, principally for creditrisk. Credit risk capital decreased $0.8&nbsp;billion over the period, primarily dueto a reduction in commercial exposures, improvement in the credit quality ofthe commercial portfolio and an increase in single-name credit derivative hedgeactivity.The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's capital management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should be read inconjunction with page 41 and Note 26 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory CapitalJPMorgan Chase's risk-based capital ratios at September&nbsp;30, 2003, were well inexcess of minimum regulatory guidelines. At September&nbsp;30, 2003, Tier 1 andTotal Capital ratios were 8.7% and 12.1%, respectively, and the Tier 1 leverageratio was 5.5%. At September&nbsp;30, 2003, total capital of JPMorgan Chase (the sumof Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital) was $59.5&nbsp;billion, an increase of $5.0&nbsp;billionfrom December&nbsp;31, 2002. This increase reflected a $5.0&nbsp;billion increase in Tier1 Capital, primarily driven by $2.7&nbsp;billion in retained earnings (net incomeless common and preferred dividends) generated during the period, $1.1&nbsp;billionin Tier 1 trust preferred45 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)issuance and $1.0&nbsp;billion in net stock issuances related to employee benefitplans. There was minimal impact to the Firm's Tier 1 and Total Capital ratiosdue to the adoption of FIN 46, as the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem (&#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;) provided interim regulatory capital reliefrelated to asset-backed commercial paper conduits and trust preferred vehicles.The effects of FIN 46 on the Firm's leverage ratio at September&nbsp;30, 2003, was areduction of approximately 12 basis points as no regulatory capital relief wasprovided for leverage calculations. The Firm did not repurchase shares of itscommon stock during the first nine months of 2003. The Firm changed itscalculation of risk-weighted assets during the third quarter of 2003; capitalratios for periods ended prior to June&nbsp;30, 2003, have not been recalculated.DividendsIn the third quarter of 2003, JPMorgan Chase declared a quarterly cash dividendon its common stock of $0.34 per share, payable October&nbsp;31, 2003, tostockholders of record at the close of business on October&nbsp;6, 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management focusesprimarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002, and should be read inconjunction with pages 42&#150;43 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.In managing liquidity, the Firm considers a variety of liquidity risk measuresas well as market conditions, prevailing interest rates, liquidity needs andthe desired maturity profile of its liabilities.JPMorgan Chase's liquidity management framework utilizes liquidity monitoringtools and a contingency funding plan to maintain appropriate levels ofliquidity through normal and stress periods. The parent company's liquiditypolicy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet funding requirements fornormal operating activities and to repay all obligations with a maturity of oneyear and under. In addition, JPMorgan Chase maintains appropriate liquidity tomanage through normal and stress periods, taking into account historical dataon funding of loan commitments (i.e., commercial paper backup facilities),liquidity commitments to conduits and collateral-posting requirements. Sourcesof funds include the capital markets, the operations of the Firm's subsidiaries(including the ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank to raise funds through deposits)and securitization programs.Consistent with its liquidity management policy, the Firm will continue toraise funds at the holding company sufficient to cover estimated obligationsthat will mature over the next 12&nbsp;months.Credit RatingsJPMorgan Chase's parent holding company and JPMorgan Chase Bank's creditratings as of October&nbsp;31, 2003, were as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;As of October&nbsp;31, 2003, the ratings outlook for the parent holding company byMoody's Investor Services (&#147;Moody's&#148;), Standard & Poor's (&#147;S&P&#148;) and Fitch,Inc. (&#147;Fitch&#148;) was stable.Balance sheetThe Firm's total assets increased $34&nbsp;billion, to $793&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2003, from $759&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. The September&nbsp;30, 2003, balancesheet includes the effect of adopting FIN 46, which added $15&nbsp;billion to totalassets, including $11&nbsp;billion in commercial loans primarily associated withmulti-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduits. Commercial loans declined,despite the $11&nbsp;billion impact of adopting FIN 46, as a result of weaker loandemand, as well as the Firm's ongoing efforts to reduce commercial exposure.Mortgage loans were up significantly, reflecting record origination andrefinancing activity brought about by lower interest rates during 2003.Additionally, there was a continued, unusually high level of U.S. Treasurysecurities settlement failures (especially 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes) bymajor market participants; the effect of these failures was to increase Otherassets and Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities byapproximately $14&nbsp;billion. Other than the balance sheet impact, the settlementfailures had essentially no impact on the Firm's results for the nine monthsended September&nbsp;30, 2003. In addition, Trading assets and Securities bothdeclined consistent with the outlook for interest rates. The decline incommercial loans and the ongoing growth in deposits contributed to the declinein Federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.IssuancesDuring the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, JPMorgan Chase issuedapproximately $11.0&nbsp;billion of long-term debt; during the same period, $6.0billion of long-term debt matured or was redeemed. In addition, the Firmsecuritized approximately$8.8&nbsp;billion of residential mortgage loans, $6.0&nbsp;billion of credit card loansand $3.5&nbsp;billion of automobile loans, resulting in pre-tax gains onsecuritizations of $245.6&nbsp;million, $31.2&nbsp;million and $12.7&nbsp;million,respectively. For a further discussion of loan securitizations, see Note 9 ofthis Form 10-Q and Note 11 on pages 83&#150;87 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 AnnualReport.46 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Off-balance sheet arrangementsSpecial-purpose entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) or special-purpose vehicles (&#147;SPVs&#148;) are animportant part of the financial markets, providing market liquidity byfacilitating investors' access to specific portfolios of assets and risks.JPMorgan Chase is involved with SPEs in three broad categories of transactions:loan securitizations, multi-seller conduits and client intermediation. Capitalis held, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and exposuressuch as derivative transactions and lending commitments. The Firm has nocommitments to issue its own stock to support an SPE transaction, and itspolicies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm's length andreflect market pricing. For a further discussion of SPEs and the Firm'saccounting for SPEs, see Note 9 of this Form 10-Q.For certain liquidity commitments to SPEs, the Firm could be required toprovide funding if the credit rating of JPMorgan Chase Bank were downgradedbelow specific levels, primarily P-1, A-1 and F1 for Moody's, Standard & Poor'sand Fitch, respectively. The amount of these liquidity commitments was $36billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003. If JPMorgan Chase Bank were required to providefunding under these commitments, the Firm could be replaced as liquidityprovider. Additionally, with respect to the multi-seller conduits andstructured commercial loan vehicles for which JPMorgan Chase Bank has extendedliquidity commitments, the Bank could facilitate the sale or refinancing of theSPE assets in order to provide liquidity. All of the Firm's liquiditycommitments to SPEs, after taking into account the consolidation ofmulti-seller conduits in accordance with FIN 46, are included in the Firm'stotal $172&nbsp;billion in other unfunded commitments to extend credit included inthe table below, which is described in more detail in Note 20 of this Form10-Q. The adoption of FIN 46 did not affect the Firm's liquidity commitments toSPEs.The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase's off-balance sheetlending-related financial instruments at September&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The following discussion of JPMorgan Chase's credit risk profile as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, focuses primarily on developments since December&nbsp;31, 2002,and should be read in conjunction with pages 45&#150;57, pages 65&#150;66 and Notes 9,10, 29 and 30 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.The Firm assesses its credit exposures on a managed basis, taking into accountthe impact of credit card securitizations. For a reconciliation of credit costson a managed, or operating, basis to reported results, see page 29 of this Form10-Q. The following table presents the Firm's managed credit-relatedinformation for the dates indicated.47 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CREDIT PORTFOLIO&nbsp;The following table presents a summary of managed credit-related informationfor the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;JPMorgan Chase's total credit exposure (including $34&nbsp;billion of securitizedcredit cards) was $563&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003, a$5&nbsp;billion, or 1%, decrease from $568&nbsp;billion at year-end 2002. The modestdecline reflected a change in the portfolio's composition. Commercial creditexposure decreased by $32&nbsp;billion, including a $3&nbsp;billion decrease incommercial loans and a $29&nbsp;billion decrease in lending-related commitments. Thecommercial loan decrease consisted of a $14&nbsp;billion decline in lending activity&#150; the result of weaker demand, as well as the Firm's ongoing credit managementactivities &#150; partially offset by an $11&nbsp;billion increase related toVIEs consolidated in accordance with FIN 46. The decrease in lending-relatedcommitments was due to an overall contraction in lending demand and reflected a$12&nbsp;billion decline due to the adoption of FIN 46. The decrease in commercialexposure was partially offset by an increase of $27&nbsp;billion in managed consumerloans, primarily resulting from a higher amount of mortgage and automobileoriginations.&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO&nbsp;Total commercial exposure (loans, derivative receivables, unfundedlending-related commitments and Other receivables) was $381&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with $413&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002.Below are summaries of the maturity and risk profiles of the commercialportfolio as of September&nbsp;30, 2003, and December&nbsp;31, 2002. Ratings are based onthe Firm's internal risk ratings, presented on an S&P-equivalent basis.&nbsp;49 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggregate risk profile of the Firm's total commercial credit exposurecontinued to improve. The proportion of the total commercial portfolio deemedinvestment-grade increased from 80% at December&nbsp;31, 2002, to 83% at September30, 2003, reflecting continued improvement in the risk profile of allcomponents of commercial credit exposure. Credit quality of commercial loansimproved from 55% deemed investment-grade at December&nbsp;31, 2002, to 65% atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, as a result of $10.9&nbsp;billion in additional loans recorded pursuant to the adoption of FIN 46,restructurings of several nonperforming commercial loans and an improvement incredit quality of the portfolio. Excluding the impact of FIN 46, theinvestment-grade component of commercial loans would have been 60% at September30, 2003.At September&nbsp;30, 2003, the derivative receivables investment-grade componentimproved to 89%, and the investment-grade component of lending-relatedcommitments improved to 88%. Concurrently, the noncriticized portion of thenoninvestment-grade portfolio declined by 18%, primarily due to reductions inlending-related commitments and loans outstanding. &nbsp;50 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Criticized ExposureThe criticized component (both performing and nonperforming) of totalcommercial exposure declined by 32%, or $5.3&nbsp;billion, during the first ninemonths of 2003, primarily as a result of successful restructurings of exposuresin merchant energy and related industries; criticized exposures to this sectordeclined by $1.5&nbsp;billion during the period. Criticized emerging marketsexposures declined by 75%, or $0.9&nbsp;billion, during the first nine months of2003, primarily due to the improved creditworthiness of Brazil in the secondquarter of 2003. The criticized component of telecom and related industriesdeclined by $0.5&nbsp;billion, primarily due to restructurings and charge-offs takenduring the year. The balance of the decline in criticized commercial exposureof $2.4&nbsp;billion, including $0.5&nbsp;billion of charge-offs, was the result ofreductions across a broad number of other industries.Total commercial nonperforming assets were $3.0&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003,which included $343&nbsp;million related to Enron. The $381&nbsp;million decline incommercial nonperforming assets for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003,was largely driven by charge-offs and dispositions. Commercial loan netcharge-offs for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, were $259&nbsp;million,compared with $834&nbsp;million for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, and$257&nbsp;million for the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003. For the nine monthsended September&nbsp;30, 2003, commercial loan net charge-offs were $808&nbsp;million,versus $1.4&nbsp;billion for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002. The netcharge-off ratio for commercial loans was 1.09% for the third quarter of 2003(1.24% excluding the impact of exposures related to the adoption of FIN 46),compared with 3.53% for the third quarter of 2002 and 1.20% for the secondquarter of 2003.The Firm anticipates a continued improvement in commercial credit quality overthe remainder of the year.51 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Commercial Credit Exposure Select Industry ConcentrationsThe Firm continues to focus on the management and diversification of itsindustry concentrations, with particular attention on exposures to industriesdeemed by the Firm to have higher levels of risk. A discussion of the Firm'sexposure to selected industries is set forth below.&nbsp;Note: JPMorgan Chase's internal risk ratings generally correspond to the following ratings as defined by Standard & Poor's / Moody's:&nbsp;During the first nine months of 2003, the Firm continued to actively manage itsexposure to the Telecom and related, Cable, and Merchant Energy and relatedsectors, taking a selective approach to extending additional credit to clientsin these three sectors. Total exposure to these sectors declined 23% sinceDecember&nbsp;31, 2002. The investment-grade component of the combined portfoliosimproved from 54% as of year-end 2002 to 59% as of September&nbsp;30, 2003.Criticized exposure to these sectors declined by 31%, or $2.1&nbsp;billion, fromDecember&nbsp;31, 2002, and nonperforming exposure decreased by 36% over the sameperiod, primarily as a result of successful restructurings, collateralizationsof exposures and net charge-offs.52 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)New Industry ClassificationsThe Firm has undertaken a review of its internal industry classifications, withthe objectives of enabling more proactive portfolio analysis and improvingcredit risk management. The Firm is in the process of establishing new internalindustry classifications that provide stronger linkages between exposures withcommon risk attributes. The goal is to finalize the new industryclassifications by the end of the year, for presentation in the 2003 AnnualReport.In the first nine months of 2003, Enron-related exposure decreased by $58million, from $688&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, to $630&nbsp;million as ofSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to the maturity of $50million of debtor-in-possession financing. Of the $88&nbsp;million inlending-related commitments, $75&nbsp;million relates to debtor-in-possessionfinancing.Trading assets are carried at fair value. All secured loans are performing andare reported on an amortized cost basis. All unsecured exposure isnonperforming and has been written down to reflect management's estimate ofcurrent recoverable value. The$108&nbsp;million in Other assets relates to a letter of credit that is the subjectof litigation with a creditworthy entity; it is being carried at its currentestimated realizable value in accordance with SFAS 5.Derivative ContractsFor a further discussion of the derivative contracts utilized by JPMorgan Chasein connection with its trading and end-user activities, see Note 19 of thisForm 10-Q, and pages 50-53 and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.The following table summarizes the aggregate notional amounts and derivativereceivables (i.e., the MTM or fair value of the derivative contracts aftertaking into account the effects of legally enforceable master nettingagreements) at each of the dates indicated:&nbsp;&nbsp;The $31 trillion of notional principal of the Firm's derivative contractsoutstanding at September&nbsp;30, 2003, does not represent, in the Firm's view, theactual credit losses that could arise from such transactions. For mostderivative transactions, the notional principal amount does not change hands;it is simply used as a reference to calculate payments. In the Firm's view, theappropriate measure53 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)of its net current credit risk at September&nbsp;30, 2003, is $49&nbsp;billion,representing the $84&nbsp;billion MTM value of derivative receivables (after takinginto account the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements) lessthe $35&nbsp;billion of collateral held by the Firm. This compares with net currentcredit exposure, at December&nbsp;31, 2002, of $53&nbsp;billion. The $35&nbsp;billion ofcollateral excludes $4&nbsp;billion delivered by clients at the initiation oftransactions; this collateral secures exposure that could arise in the existingportfolio of derivatives should the MTM value of the client's transactions movein the Firm's favor. The $35&nbsp;billion of collateral also excludes creditenhancements in the form of letters of credit and surety receivables.The following table summarizes the risk profile, as of September&nbsp;30, 2003, ofthe Firm's Consolidated balance sheet exposure to derivative contracts, net ofcash and other highly liquid collateral held by the Firm. Ratings below arebased upon the Firm's internal risk ratings and are presented on anS&P-equivalent basis:While useful as a view of current credit exposure, the net MTM value of thederivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability ofthat credit exposure. To capture this variability, the Firm measures, on aclient-by-client basis, both the worst-case, or peak, future credit exposure(at a 97.5% confidence level), as well as the expected credit exposure.However, the total potential future credit exposure embedded in the derivativesportfolio is neither the simple sum of all peak exposures nor the simple sum ofall expected client exposures. This is because credit risk is reduced at theportfolio level when offsetting transactions are entered into with separatecounterparties; thus, only one of the two trades would generate a credit loss,even if both counterparties were to default simultaneously. The Firm refers tothis effect as market diversification.The Firm defines the &#147;market-diversified peak&#148; as the maximum loss (estimatedat the 97.5% confidence level) that would occur if all counterparties were todefault over a one-year time horizon with no recovery. The market-diversifiedpeak, after taking into account both collateral and netting, was approximately$53&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with $57&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31,2002. As a general rule, since all counterparties will not defaultconcurrently, nor will all default when their exposures are at peak levels,this is, in the Firm's view, a conservative measure of potential futurederivatives credit risk.The Firm held $35&nbsp;billion of collateral at September&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with$30&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. This represents collateralization ofapproximately three-fourths of the Firm's derivatives transactions at September30, 2003, versus approximately two-thirds at December&nbsp;31, 2002. These amountsexclude credit enhancements in the form of letters of credit and suretyreceivables. The Firm posted $21&nbsp;billion of collateral at September&nbsp;30, 2003,compared with $19&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002. Certain derivative andcollateral agreements include provisions that require both the Firm and thecounterparty, upon specified downgrades in their respective credit ratings, topost collateral for the benefit of the other party. The impact on requiredcollateral of a single-notch ratings downgrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank, from itscurrent rating of AA- to A&#043;, would have been an additional $1.3&nbsp;billion ofcollateral as of September&nbsp;30, 2003. The impact of a six-notch ratingsdowngrade to JPMorgan Chase Bank (from AA- to BBB-) would have been $4.2billion of additional collateral from levels as of September&nbsp;30, 2003. Certainderivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generallyupon JPMorgan Chase Bank being downgraded, at the then-existing MTM value ofthe derivative receivables.Use of credit derivativesThe following table presents the notional amounts of credit derivativesprotection bought and sold at September&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;54 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase has modest counterparty exposure as a result of creditderivatives transactions. Of the $84&nbsp;billion of total derivative receivables atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, approximately $3&nbsp;billion, or 4%, was associated with creditderivatives, before the benefit of collateral. The use of derivatives to managecredit exposures does not reduce the reported level of assets on theConsolidated balance sheet or the level of reported off-balance sheetcommitments.Portfolio management activityIn managing its commercial credit exposure, the Firm purchases single-name andportfolio credit derivatives to hedge these exposures. As of September&nbsp;30,2003, the notional outstanding amount of protection purchased via single-nameand portfolio credit derivatives was $31&nbsp;billion and $2&nbsp;billion, respectively.The Firm also diversifies its exposures by providing (i.e., selling) smallamounts of credit protection, which increases exposure to industries or clientswhere the Firm has little or no client-related exposure. This activity is notmaterial to the Firm's overall credit exposure; credit protection sold totaled$173&nbsp;million in notional exposure at September&nbsp;30, 2003.The credit derivatives used by JPMorgan Chase for its portfolio managementactivities do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Thesederivatives are marked to market in Trading revenue. The MTM value incorporatesboth the cost of hedge premiums and changes in value due to movement in spreadsand credit events, whereas the loans and lending-related commitments beinghedged are accounted for on an accrual basis in Net interest income. Thisasymmetry in accounting treatment between loans and lending-related commitmentsand the credit derivatives utilized in the portfolio management activitiescauses earnings volatility that is not representative of the true changes invalue of the Firm's overall credit exposures. The MTM treatment of both theFirm's credit derivative hedges (&#147;short&#148; credit positions) and the CreditValuation Adjustment (&#147;CVA&#148;), which reflects the credit quality of derivativescounterparty exposure (&#147;long&#148; credit positions), provides some natural offset.The CVA is based on the expected future exposure (incorporating netting andcollateral) to a counterparty, and on the counterparty's credit derivativespread. The Firm manages components of the CVA by entering into creditderivative hedges and market risk derivative hedges (e.g. interest rate,foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivatives).Included in Trading revenue are losses of $163&nbsp;million in the third quarter of2003 related to credit derivatives that were used to hedge the Firm's creditexposure, of which approximately $75&nbsp;million was associated with creditderivatives used to hedge accrual lending activities. The losses were generallydriven by an overall global tightening of credit spreads. The $163&nbsp;million losswas largely offset by $151&nbsp;million of trading revenue gains related to the MTMvalue of the CVA and corresponding market risk derivative hedges, resulting ina portfolio management activity net loss of $12&nbsp;million. Since the thirdquarter of 2002, the quarterly portfolio management activity performanceresults have ranged from a net loss of $119&nbsp;million, when credit spreadscontracted, to a net gain of $83&nbsp;million, in the third quarter of 2002, whencredit spreads widened. The CVA was $796&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2003,compared with $1.3&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2002, driven primarily by tighteningof credit spreads.Dealer Client ActivityAs of September&nbsp;30, 2003, the total notional amounts of protection purchasedand sold by the dealer business were $223&nbsp;billion and$240&nbsp;billion, respectively. The mismatch between these notional amounts isattributable to the Firm selling protection on large, diversified,predominantly investment-grade portfolios (including the most senior tranches)and then hedging these positions by buying protection on the more subordinatedtranches of the same portfolios. In addition, the Firm may use securities tohedge certain derivative positions. Consequently, while there is a mismatch innotional amounts of credit derivatives, in the Firm's view the risk positionsare largely matched. The amount of credit risk contributed by the Firm's creditderivatives dealer activity is immaterial in the context of JPMorgan Chase'soverall credit exposures.Country ExposureThe Firm has a comprehensive process for measuring and managing its countryexposures and risk. Exposures to a country include all credit-related lending,trading and investment activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Inaddition, country exposures include exposures to both government andprivate-sector entities in a country.The Firm's exposures to the countries disclosed in JPMorgan Chase's QuarterlyReport on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2003, have remainedrelatively stable or declined. Likewise, during the quarter, the creditconditions in these countries remained stable or improved.55 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;CONSUMER PORTFOLIO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)JPMorgan Chase's consumer portfolio continues to be primarily domestic and isgeographically diversified. JPMorgan Chase's managed consumer portfolio totaled$182&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003, an increase of $27&nbsp;billion since year-end2002. Consumer net charge-offs on a managed basis were $826&nbsp;million and $786million for the third quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively, and $2.5&nbsp;billionand $2.4&nbsp;billion for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003 and 2002,respectively. The increase in the comparable quarter and year-to-date netcharge-offs was primarily due to an increase in credit card net charge-offs,reflecting a higher level of average outstandings. The Firm continues toanticipate higher charge-offs in its consumer loan portfolio for full-year 2003than for full-year 2002, primarily as a result of a higher level of loansoutstanding.The following discussion relates to the specific loan categories within theconsumer portfolio:Residential Mortgage Loans: Residential mortgage loans were $86&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, a $22&nbsp;billion increase from the 2002&nbsp;year-end. The growthin this portfolio was driven by new mortgage originations.Nonperforming 1&#150;4family residential mortgage loans increased to $317&nbsp;million from $312&nbsp;millionfrom year-end. The net charge-off rate for the third quarter of 2003 decreasedto 0.02% from 0.05% at the third quarter of 2002. The net charge-off rate forthe nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, decreased to 0.04% from 0.10% for thesame period of the prior year. At September&nbsp;30, 2003, the Firm had $2.0&nbsp;billionof sub-prime residential mortgage loans, of which $1.5&nbsp;billion were held forsale. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, sub-prime residential mortgage loans outstandingwere $1.8&nbsp;billion, of which $1.3&nbsp;billion were held for sale.Credit Card Loans: JPMorgan Chase analyzes its credit card portfolio on a&#147;managed basis,&#148; which includes credit card receivables on the Consolidatedbalance sheets as well as credit card receivables that have been securitized.Managed consumer credit card receivables were $50&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30,2003, flat relative to year-end 2002. During the 2003 third quarter, netcharge-offs as a percentage of average credit card receivables increased to5.80%, compared with 5.51% for the third quarter of 2002. Loans over 90&nbsp;dayspast due decreased to 2.07% of the portfolio at September&nbsp;30, 2003, comparedwith 2.14% at December&nbsp;31, 2002. During the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,2003, net charge-off rates as a percentage of average credit card receivablesdecreased slightly, to 5.92% from 5.93% in the same period last year.Automobile Financings: Automobile financings outstanding increased by $5billion to $39&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003, when compared with year-end 2002.This increase was driven by originations of $22&nbsp;billion during the first ninemonths of 2003, a 21% increase in originations from the comparable period in2002. Net charge-off rates of 0.45% and 0.46% for the third quarter and ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, compared with 0.64% and 0.55% for thecomparable periods in 2002, continued to reflect the Firm's selective approachto asset origination in this portfolio.Other Consumer Loans: Other consumer loans of $7&nbsp;billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003,decreased 6% compared with year-end levels. The net charge-off rate related tothis portfolio remained flat at 2.53% compared with the third quarter of 2002.The net charge-off rate of 2.41% for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003,increased from 2.34% for the same period of the prior year, largely as a resultof charge-offs in a discontinued installment loan portfolio and moderatelyhigher charge-offs in the manufactured housing portfolio.Summary of changes in the Allowance for credit losses57 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall: The overall decrease in the allowance for credit losses from December31, 2002, to September&nbsp;30, 2003, was driven by additional securitizations inthe consumer credit card portfolio and by provisions for credit losses thatwere lower than charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio. The commercialloan portfolio provisions were lower as a result of restructurings of severallarge nonperforming commercial loans (for which the Firm had previouslyreserved) and fewer new problem commercial exposures.Loans: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is intended to cover probablecredit losses as of September&nbsp;30, 2003, for which either the asset is notspecifically identified or the size of the loss has not been fully determined.The allowance has both specific and expected loss components and a residualcomponent. As of September&nbsp;30, 2003, management deemed the allowance to beadequate (i.e., sufficient to absorb losses that currently may exist but arenot yet identifiable). The allowance represented 2.01% of loans at September30, 2003, compared with 2.47% at year-end 2002. Excluding the exposures relatedto the FIN 46 adoption, the allowance ratio would have been 2.11% at September30, 2003. The allowance for loan losses declined by $597&nbsp;million from year-end2002 and $510&nbsp;million from September&nbsp;30, 2002.The commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $1.1&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, a decrease of $507&nbsp;million, or 32%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease was primarily attributable to charge-offs and restructuring ofexposures during the period.The commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $481&nbsp;million atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, a decrease of $132&nbsp;million, or 22%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease reflected a reduction in the amount, and an improvement in the averagequality, of the noncriticized portion of the portfolio.The consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $2.2&nbsp;billion atSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, a decline of $126&nbsp;million, or 5%, from year-end 2002. Thedecrease was primarily attributable to the transfer of the allowance foraccrued fees on securitized credit card loans to Other assets and to a lowerlevel of credit card outstandings.The residual component of the allowance was $942&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2003,an increase of $168&nbsp;million from year-end 2002, and was unchanged from June&nbsp;30,2003. The formula-based commercial specific and expected components do notconsider uncertainties in the economic environment or the impact ofconcentrations in the commercial loan portfolio. These uncertainties areaddressed by the residual component of the allowance, which incorporatesmanagement's judgment. At September&nbsp;30, 2003, the residual componentrepresented approximately 20% of the total allowance for loan losses and was atthe upper end of management's target range of 10% to 20% of the totalallowance. If current commercial loan quality trends continue, the Firm'spolicies will require a further reduction in the overall allowance, includingthe residual component.Lending-related commitments: To provide for the risk of loss inherent in theFirm's process of extending credit, management also computes specific andexpected loss components, as well as a residual component, for lending-relatedcommitments. These are computed using a methodology similar to that used forthe loan portfolio, modified for expected maturities and probabilities ofdrawdown. This allowance, which is reported in Other liabilities, was $329million, $363&nbsp;million and $573&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2003, December&nbsp;31,2002, and September&nbsp;30, 2002, respectively. The allowance for lending-relatedcommitments decreased by $34&nbsp;million during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003. For the ninemonths ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, there were no charge-offs of lending-relatedcommitments.58 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)Capital Allocation for Credit RiskIn the second quarter of 2003, the Firm implemented a revised risk and capitalmeasurement methodology for the assessment of credit risk. The new approachemploys estimates of default likelihood that are derived from current marketparameters to capture the impact of both defaults and declines in market valuedue to credit deterioration. This approach is intended to reflect moreaccurately current market conditions, as well as to enhance the management ofcommercial credit risk, by encouraging the utilization of the growing marketsin credit derivatives and secondary market loan sales.&nbsp;MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;Risk management processFor a discussion of theFirm's market risk management process, see page 58 of the 2002Annual Report.Risk measurementValue-at-RiskJPMorgan Chase's statistical risk measure, VAR, gauges the potential loss fromadverse market moves in an ordinary market environment and provides aconsistent cross-business measure of risk profiles and levels of riskdiversification. Each business day, the Firm undertakes a comprehensive VARcalculation that includes its trading, investment and asset/liability (&#147;A/L&#148;)management activities. The Firm calculates VAR reported below using a one-day time horizon anda 99% confidence level. This means the Firm would expect to incur lossesgreater than that predicted by VAR estimates only once every 100 trading days,or about 2.5 times a year. For the first nine months of 2003, actual Firm-widemarket risk-related losses exceeded corporate VAR on only two days, a resultwhich is consistent with the 99% confidence level. For a further discussion ofthe Firm's VAR methodology, see pages 58-60 of the 2002 Annual Report.Although no single risk statistic can reflect all aspects of market risk, thetable below provides a meaningful overview of the Firm's market risk exposurearising from its trading activities and investment and A/L portfolios.&nbsp;&nbsp;59 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily average Trading Portfolio VAR for the first nine months of 2003 was$60.3&nbsp;million. The largest contributor was interest rate risk, which includescredit spread risk. Before portfolio diversification, interest rate riskaccounted for 64% of the average Trading Portfolio VAR. The diversificationeffect, which on average reduced the daily average Trading Portfolio VAR by$34.4&nbsp;million in the first nine months of 2003, reflects the fact that thelargest losses for different positions and risks do not typically occur at thesame time. The risk of a portfolio of positions is therefore usually less thanthe sum of the risks of the positions themselves. The degree of diversificationis determined both by the extent to which different market variables tend tomove together and by the extent to which different businesses have similarpositions. The decline in the daily average Trading Portfolio VAR, comparedwith the first nine months of 2002, was driven primarily by reducedposition-taking in interest rate businesses. The quarterly average TradingPortfolio VAR has increased since the second quarter of 2003, rising from $58.8million to $68.1&nbsp;million in the third quarter, a 16% increase. This was due toincreased market volatility in interest rate markets and larger risk positionscarried by the Firm.VARs for the Investment Portfolio and A/L Activities measure the amount ofpotential change in their economic value; they are not true measures ofpotential volatility in reported revenues, since only part of those activitiesare marked to market through earnings. More than 95% of the Firm's aggregateInvestment Portfolio and A/L Activities VAR is related to fourportfolio-management activities: A/L interest rate exposures, investmentsecurities, MSRs and the whole-loan mortgage portfolio. Average Investment Portfolio andA/L Activities VAR for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, wassubstantially higher than average VAR for the nine months ended the prior year,increasing 50% to $144.1&nbsp;million from $96.0&nbsp;million. This resulted primarilyfrom increased volatility in interest rate markets, larger exposure to thespread between mortgage and swap rates, and a shift in interest rate riskpositions in the mortgage activities of CHF.HistogramThe histogram below illustrates the Firm's daily market risk-related revenue,which is defined as the daily change in value of the MTM trading portfoliosplus any trading-related Net interest income (&#147;NII&#148;), brokerage commissions,underwriting fees or other revenue. In the first nine months of 2003, JPMorganChase posted positive daily market risk-related revenue for 178 out of 194days, with 139&nbsp;days exceeding $25&nbsp;million. Losses were sustained on 16&nbsp;days,with five days exceeding $25&nbsp;million. The average daily market risk-relatedrevenue for the first nine months of 2003 was $43.6&nbsp;million.Nine Months Ended September&nbsp;30, 200360 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)To evaluate the soundness of the VAR model, daily back-testing is conductedagainst actual financial results, based on daily market risk-related revenue.The inset above examines the 16&nbsp;days on which JPMorgan Chase posted tradinglosses and depicts the amount by which VAR exceeded the actual loss on eachday. The inset shows that losses exceeded VAR on only two days,primarily attributable tolosses on basis exposure in mortgage products and related hedgepositions and to spread and directional interest rate losses, a performance statistically consistent with the Firm's 99%confidence level.Stress TestingWhile VAR reflects the risk of loss due to unlikely events in normal markets,stress testing captures the Firm's exposure to unlikely but plausible events inabnormal markets. The Firm stress tests its portfolios at least once a month,at both the corporate and business segment levels, using multiple scenarios.Scenarios are continually reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the Firm'srisk profile and economic events. The following table represents the potentialeconomic value stress-test loss (pre-tax) in JPMorgan Chase's trading portfolioas predicted by the Firm's stress-test scenarios:It is important to note that VAR results cannot be directly correlated tostress-test loss results for three reasons. First, stress-test losses arecalculated at varying dates each month, while VAR is performed daily andreported for the period-end date. Second, VAR and stress tests are two distinctrisk measurements yielding very different loss potentials. Although the sametrading portfolios are used for both tests, VAR is based on a distribution ofone-day historical losses measured over the most recent year; by contrast,stress testing subjects the portfolio to more extreme, larger moves over alonger time horizon (i.e., 2&#150;3&nbsp;weeks). Third, as VAR and stress tests aredistinct risk measurements, the impact of portfolio diversification can varygreatly. For VAR, markets can change in patterns over a one-year time horizon,moving from highly correlated to less so; in stress testing, the focus is on asingle event and the associated correlations in an extreme market situation. Asa result, while VAR over a given time horizon can be lowered by adiversification benefit in the portfolio, this benefit would not necessarilymanifest itself in stress-test scenarios, which assume large coherent movesacross all markets. For a further discussion of the Firm's stress-testmethodology, see pages 60&#150;61 of the 2002 Annual Report.The Firm conducts both economic-value and NII stress tests on its investmentportfolios and A/L activities. The more conventional NII stress test measuresthe potential change in the Firm's NII over the next year. For the quarterended September&nbsp;30, 2003, JPMorgan Chase's largest potential NII stress-testloss was estimated at $75&nbsp;million, using a scenario in which credit spreadswiden significantly and, at the same time, equity prices decline and interestrates fall in the major currencies. The Firm also stresses NII for a100-basis-point rise in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift in the yieldcurve. For the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, this NII stress-test loss wasestimated at $200&nbsp;million. Economic-value stress tests measure the potentialchange in the value of the investment portfolios and A/L activities under thesame scenarios used to evaluate the trading portfolios. For the quarter endedSeptember&nbsp;30, 2003, JPMorgan Chase's largest potential economic-valuestress-test loss on its investment portfolios and A/L activities was associatedwith a scenario that assumes a sharp widening in credit spreads and decreasesin interest rates.Other statistical and nonstatistical risk measuresFor a discussion of the Firm's other risk measures, see page 61 of JPMorganChase's 2002 Annual Report.Capital allocation for market riskFor a discussion of the Firm's capital allocation for market risk, see page 61of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Risk monitoring and controlFor a discussion of the Firm's risk monitoring and control process, includinglimits, qualitative risk assessments, model review and policies and procedures,see page 62 of the 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;OPERATIONAL AND BUSINESS RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The Firm implemented a new risk-based capital allocation methodology during thesecond quarter of 2003, which separates operating risk into its two components,operational risk and business risk. Operational risk is the risk of lossresulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors orexternal events. The operational risk model is loss-based, with adjustments toreflect changes in the quality of the control environment, and with a potentialoffset for the use of risk-transfer products. Business risk is defined as therisk associated with the volatility in the Firm's earnings due to factors notcaptured by other parts of the Firm's economic capital framework. For businessrisk, capital is allocated to each business based on historical revenuevolatility and measures of fixed and variable expenses. Earnings volatilityarising from other risk factors, such as credit, market or operational risks,is excluded from the measurement of business risk capital, as those factors arecaptured under those risk capital models. For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase'soperational and business risk management, refer to pages 63-64 of JPMorganChase's 2002 Annual Report.61 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;PRIVATE EQUITY RISK MANAGEMENT&nbsp;The Firm refined its methodology for measuring private equity risk during thesecond quarter of 2003. It now assigns a moderately higher amount of capitalfor the risk in the private equity portfolio, most of which is assigned toJPMorgan Partners. For a discussion of JPMorgan Chase's private equity riskmanagement, refer to page 65 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.&nbsp;SUPERVISION AND REGULATION&nbsp;The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Supervision andRegulation section on pages 1&#150;6 of JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Form 10-K.DividendsJPMorgan Chase's bank subsidiaries could pay dividends to their respective bankholding companies, without the approval of their relevant banking regulators,in amounts up to the limitations imposed upon such banks by regulatoryrestrictions. These limitations, in the aggregate, totaled approximately $4.5billion at September&nbsp;30, 2003.&nbsp;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM&nbsp;The Firm's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral tounderstanding reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimatesrequire management's judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets andliabilities. The Firm has established detailed policies and control proceduresintended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as partof such methods, are well controlled, independently reviewed and appliedconsistently from period to period. In addition, the policies and proceduresare intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in anappropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining thevaluation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. For a furtherdescription of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significantmanagement valuation judgments, see pages 65&#150;67 and the Notes to consolidatedfinancial statements in JPMorgan Chase's 2002 Annual Report.Allowance for Credit LossesThe Firm's allowance for loan losses is sensitive to the risk rating assignedto a loan. Assuming a one-notch downgrade in the Firm's internal risk ratingsfor all of its commercial loans, the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans would increase by approximately $538&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30, 2003. Thissensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used with caution. Thepurpose of this analysis is to provide an indication of the impact that riskratings have on the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for commercialloans. It is not intended to imply management's expectation of futuredeterioration in risk ratings. Given the process the Firm follows indetermining the risk ratings of its loans, management believes the ratingscurrently assigned to its commercial loans are appropriate and the likelihoodof a one-notch downgrade for all commercial loans is remote.Trading and Available-for-Sale portfoliosThe following table summarizes the trading and available-for-sale portfolios byvaluation methodology at September&nbsp;30, 2003:&nbsp;&nbsp;62 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)&nbsp;NONEXCHANGE-TRADED COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE&nbsp;In the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase trades nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts, which are primarily energy-related. To determine the fairvalue of these contracts, the Firm uses various fair value estimationtechniques, which are primarily based on internal models with significantobservable market parameters. The following table summarizes the changes infair value for nonexchange-traded commodity contracts for the first nine monthsof 2003:The following table indicates the schedule of maturities of nonexchange-tradedcommodity contracts at September&nbsp;30, 2003:ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS&nbsp;Consolidation of variable interest entitiesEffective July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Firm adopted the provisions of FIN 46 for all VIEsoriginated prior to February&nbsp;1, 2003, excluding certain investments made byJPMP. The FASB provided a specific deferral for nonregistered investmentcompanies until the proposed SOP on the clarification of the scope of theInvestment Company Audit Guide is finalized, which is expected to occur inmid-2004. The Firm deferred consolidation of $2.5&nbsp;billion of assets related toJPMP as of July&nbsp;1, 2003.FIN 46 is a complex accounting interpretation. Future amendments of theinterpretation and new implementation guidance related to FIN 46 could affectthe Firm's application of FIN 46 in future periods. In addition, the Firm isactively assessing restructuring alternatives for the multi-seller asset-backedcommercial paper conduits. For further details regarding FIN 46, refer to Note9 of this Form 10-Q.Derivative instruments and hedging activitiesIn April&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, which amends and clarifies accountingfor derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embeddedin other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. Specifically,SFAS 149 clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial netinvestment meets the characteristic of a derivative, and when a derivativecontains a financing component that warrants special reporting in theConsolidated statement of cash flows. SFAS 149 is generally effective forcontracts entered into or modified after June&nbsp;30, 2003; the related impact wasnot material to the Firm's Consolidated financial statements.Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equityIn May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, which establishes standards for how anissuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certainfinancial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Itrequires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within itsscope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances), because thatfinancial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. SFAS 150 waseffective immediately for all financial instruments entered into or modifiedafter May&nbsp;31, 2003, and was otherwise effective beginning July&nbsp;1, 2003. Theimplementation of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the Firm'sConsolidated financial statements.63 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IItem&nbsp;2 (continued)J.P.

Plaintiffs in these actions are institutional investors who purchasedmore than $2.0&nbsp;billion in original face amount of asset-backed securitiesissued by CFSI. The securities were backed by delinquent credit cardreceivables. In addition to JPMSI, the defendants in70 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)various of the actions are the founders and key executives of CFSI, as well asits auditors and outside counsel. JPMSI is alleged to have been the investmentbankers to CFSI and to have acted as an initial purchaser and as placementagent in connection with the issuance of certain of the securities.

Beginning in May&nbsp;2001, JPMorgan Chase and certain ofits securities subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous other firms inthe securities industry, as defendants in a large number of putative classaction lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of New York. These suits purport to challenge alleged improprieties inthe allocation of stock in various public offerings, including some offeringsfor which a JPMorgan Chase entity served as an underwriter. The suits allegeviolations of securities and antitrust laws arising from alleged materialmisstatements and omissions in registration statements and prospectuses for theinitial public offerings (&#147;IPOs&#148;) and alleged market manipulation with respectto aftermarket transactions in the offered securities. The securities claimsallege, among other things, misrepresentations and market manipulation of theaftermarket trading for these offerings by tying allocations of shares in IPOsto undisclosed excessive commissions paid to JPMorgan Chase and to requiredaftermarket purchase transactions by customers who received allocations ofshares in the respective IPOs, as well as allegations of misleading analystreports. The antitrust claims allege an illegal conspiracy to requirecustomers, in exchange for IPO allocations, to pay undisclosed and excessivecommissions and to make aftermarket purchases of the IPO securities at a pricehigher than the offering price as a precondition to receiving allocations. OnFebruary&nbsp;13, 2003, the Court denied the motions of JPMorgan Chase and others todismiss the securities complaints. On November&nbsp;3, 2003, theCourt granted defendants' motion to dismiss the antitrustclaims relating to the IPO allocation practices. A separate antitrustclaim alleging that JPMSI and the other underwriters conspired to fixtheir underwriting fees is in discovery.JPMorgan Chase has also received various subpoenas and informal requests fromgovernmental and other agencies seeking information relating to IPO allocationpractices. On February&nbsp;20, 2003, the National Association of Securities Dealers(&#147;NASD&#148;) censured JPMSI and fined it $6&nbsp;million for activities it found toconstitute unlawful profit sharing by Hambrecht & Quist Group in the periodimmediately prior to and following its acquisition in 2000. In agreeing to theresolution of the charges, JPMSI neither admitted nor denied the NASD'scontentions. In late September JPMSI and the SEC agreed to resolve mattersrelating to the SEC's investigation of JPMSI's IPO allocation practices during1999 and 2000. The SEC alleged that JPMSI violated Rule&nbsp;101 of SEC Regulation&nbsp;Min certain &#147;hot&#148; IPOs by attempting to induce certain customers to placeaftermarket orders for IPO shares before the IPO was completed. Also, in thecase of one IPO, the SEC alleged that JPMSI violated &#147;just and equitableprinciples of trade&#148; under NASD Conduct Rule&nbsp;2110 by persuading at least onecustomer to accept an allocation of shares in a &#147;cold&#148; IPO in exchange for apromise of an allocation of shares in an upcoming IPO that was expected to beoversubscribed. JPMSI neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations, butconsented to a judgment (entered October&nbsp;1, 2003) enjoining JPMSI from futureviolations of Regulation&nbsp;M and NASD Conduct Rule&nbsp;2110 and requiring JPMSI topay a civil penalty of $25&nbsp;million.Research analysts' conflicts. On December&nbsp;20, 2002, the Firm reached anagreement in principle with the SEC, the NASD, the New York Stock Exchange(&#147;NYSE&#148;), the New York State Attorney General's Office and the North AmericanSecurities Administrators Association, on behalf of state securitiesregulators, to resolve their investigations of JPMorgan Chase relating toresearch analyst independence. Pursuant to the agreement in principle, JPMorganChase agreed, among other things: (i)&nbsp;to pay $50&nbsp;million for retrospectiverelief, (ii)&nbsp;to adopt internal structural and operational reforms that willfurther augment the steps it has already taken to ensure the integrity ofJPMorgan Chase analyst research, (iii)&nbsp;to contribute $25&nbsp;million spread overfive years to provide independent third-party research to clients and (iv)&nbsp;tocontribute $5&nbsp;million towards investor education. Mutually satisfactorysettlement documents have been negotiated and approved by the SEC, the NYSE,the NASD and the Texas State Securities Board. Mutually satisfactory settlementdocuments have been or are being negotiated with the remaining states. Theymust be approved by state regulatory authorities. On October&nbsp;31,2003, the Court entered final judgment pursuant to the settlementwith the SEC.JPMSI has been named as a co-defendant with nine other broker-dealers in twoactions involving allegations similar to those at issue in the regulatoryinvestigations: a putative class action filed in federal court in Coloradoseeking an unspecified amount of money damages for alleged violations offederal securities laws, and an action filed in West Virginia state court byWest Virginia's Attorney General seeking recovery from the defendants in theaggregate of $5,000 for each of what are alleged to be hundreds of thousands ofviolations of the state's consumer protection statute. On August&nbsp;8, 2003, theplaintiffs in the Colorado action dismissed the complaint without prejudice.Motions to dismiss the West Virginia action and to disqualify private counselretained by the Attorney General to prosecute that action are pending.71 Table of ContentsPart&nbsp;IIItem&nbsp;1 (continued)JPMSI was served by the SEC, NASD and NYSE on or about May&nbsp;30, 2003, withsubpoenas or document requests seeking information regarding certain presentand former officers and employees in connection with a follow-up to theregulatory investigations, this time focusing on whether particular individualsproperly performed supervisory functions regarding domestic equity research.The Firm is cooperating with the investigations, which continue.Litigation reserve and other. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Firmestablished a reserve of $900&nbsp;million related to costs anticipated to beincurred in connection with the various private litigation and regulatoryinquiries involving Enron and the other material legal actions, proceedings andinvestigations discussed above. In the second quarter of 2003, the Firm added$100&nbsp;million to the reserve related to Enron. Of the $1&nbsp;billion, $700&nbsp;millionwas allocated to the various cases, proceedings and investigations associatedwith Enron. The balance of $300&nbsp;million was allocated to the variouslitigations, proceedings and investigations involving the Firm's debt andequity underwriting activities and equity research practices. The reserve maybe revised in the future. As of October&nbsp;31, 2003, the Enron-related litigationreserve was $524&nbsp;million, and the balance of the $300&nbsp;million set aside atDecember&nbsp;31, 2002 was $247&nbsp;million.In addition to the various cases, proceedings and investigations for which thereserve has been established, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named asdefendants in a number of other legal actions and governmental proceedingsarising in connection with their respective businesses. Additional actions,investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters,particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages orwhere the cases present novel legal theories or involve a large number ofparties, the Firm cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of thepending matters (including the pending matters as to which the reserve has beenestablished) will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of thesematters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to eachpending matter may be. Subject to the foregoing caveat, JPMorgan Chaseanticipates, based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counseland after taking into account the aforementioned litigation reserve, that theoutcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pendingagainst it should not have a material adverse effect on the consolidatedfinancial condition of the Firm, although the outcome of a particularproceeding or the imposition of a particular fine or penalty may be material toJPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending upon,among other factors, the size of the loss or liability and the level ofJPMorgan Chase's income for that period.Item&nbsp;2 Changes in Securities and Use of ProceedsDuring the third quarter of 2003, no shares of common stock of J.P.
